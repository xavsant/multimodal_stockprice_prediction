        "title": "Apple Has a New Plan for Its App Store. Many Developers Hate It.",
        "fulltext": "After 15 years of dictating how apps are distributed on iPhones, Apple has been forced to take marching orders from European regulators. A new law to bolster tech competition has demanded that Apple open its devices to competing app stores and payment alternatives.\nBut app makers say Apple\u2019s response to the law, which is intended to give consumers and developers more choice, is a false choice. Tucked inside the plan, they argue, are new fees and rules that make it prohibitively expensive and risky to make the changes that the law was intended to bring.\nThe backlash is the latest chapter in a long-simmering fight between Apple and app makers. Apple says it must keep a tight grip on the App Store to ensure quality and safety, while many developers say the company rules with an iron fist and abuses its power to squeeze them for fees and thwart competition to its own services like Apple Music and Apple Pay.\nEuropean regulators largely sided with developers in writing the Digital Markets Act, a 2022 law that requires Apple to give app makers alternatives for selling to iPhone and iPad users. In response to a March deadline for compliance, Apple told developers last week that they essentially had three options in the European Union, home to roughly 450 million people.\nThey could stick with the status quo App Store system and continue paying Apple up to a 30 percent commission of all sales. Alternatively, they could reduce their commission to 17 percent, while taking on a new 50-euro-cent charge on every download above one million annually. Or they could avoid Apple\u2019s commission by distributing through a competing app store, while still paying Apple\u2019s download fee.\nAfter doing the math, many developers said Apple was offering a worse alternative. Several pointed out that a maker of a free app with 10 million downloads a year that opted to distribute through a competing app store would owe Apple about $400,000 a month because of the new 50-euro-cent fee, according to afee calculatorthat Apple released. That essentially guaranteed that they would stay with the existing App Store model, where they can distribute free, rather than sell through alternative marketplaces.\nSpotify, the streaming music app thatfiled an antitrust complaint against Apple in Europe, said it might abandon plans to add credit card payments for audiobooks and subscriptions because of the fees.\nEpic Games, the maker of Fortnite, whichsued Apple in 2020, said it had major questions around its plans to release a new game store because Apple\u2019s plan would give it the power to vet and approve competing app stores. And Hey.com, an email and calendar service, said the proposal had upended its plan to distribute software directly to users, which Apple isn\u2019t making possible.\n\u201cThis can\u2019t be what the European Commission meant because it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental dynamics,\u201d said David Heinemeier Hansson, one of the founders of Hey.com. \u201cApple has made the provisions so poisonous and the bar so high that it\u2019s clear no one should ever use this.\u201d\nThe mounting criticism will test how aggressively the European Union will enforce its landmark new digital policy. Executives at dozens of app companies have already called on E.U. regulators to reject Apple\u2019s proposal.\nApple said the policies complied with the E.U. law while limiting potential risks to users. \u201cApple\u2019s focus remains on creating the most secure system possible within the D.M.A.\u2019s requirements,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nAndreas Schwab, a member of the European Parliament who helped write the Digital Markets Act, said the commission would have to weigh Apple\u2019s proposal after March 7, when the rules take effect. Should the European Commission open a formal investigation, it could set up a lengthy legal battle between the E.U. regulators and one of the world\u2019s largest tech companies.\n\u201cEverything has to do with money,\u201d Mr. Schwab said. \u201cThose that complain would like to earn more money, and Apple wants to earn money with its own App Store.\u201d\nThe backlash comes at an important moment for Apple. The U.S. Justice Department isconsidering antitrust chargesagainst Apple for uncompetitive business practices, a case that could force the company to make more policy changes. Apple is also facing slowing sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs. Wall Street analysts believe that trend will continue when Apple reports quarterly results on Thursday for the three months that ended in December. This week,the company is also releasing its first new productin nearly a decade, an augmented reality device called the Vision Pro.\nThe Digital Markets Act aims to create more competition in a digital economy dominated by the biggest tech companies. These large platforms, which include Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok\u2019s owner, ByteDance, will now face new limits on using their dominance in one area like smartphones, social media or e-commerce to box in users and undercut rival services.\nA spokesman for the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch, said it would not comment on Apple\u2019s policy changes before the March deadline. He noted, however, that Apple and other large tech platforms had been urged to review any changes they planned to make to comply with the D.M.A. with the businesses likely to be most affected, to ensure that the changes wouldn\u2019t create new anticompetitive problems.\nApple said it had spoken with several developers before releasing its plan, but Apple didn\u2019t extend its outreach to some of its sharpest critics, such as the Coalition for App Fairness, a Washington trade group that has nearly 80 members, including Spotify and the Match Group, the maker of Tinder.\n\u201cIf they were serious about complying with the law, they would have done that and tried to bring people on their side for their announcement,\u201d said Rick VanMeter, executive director of the Coalition for App Fairness.\nApple said it had contacted more than 1,000 developers after the new policy was released last week and would hold sessions to answer their questions. The company said 99 percent of developers in the European Union would \u201creduce or maintain\u201d the fees they owed, and it pointed to support from people like Justin Kan, one of the founders of the video game streaming service Twitch. \u201cApple\u2019s making major concessions and game developers have more freedom now than ever,\u201d he said onX.\nOthers disagreed. Andy Yen, the chief executive of Proton, a Swiss company providing encrypted email and internet services, said Apple was offering a false alternative to the existing App Store fee structure. He said the new option was so financially prohibitive, especially the 50-euro-cent technology fee, that \u201cnobody in their right mind is going to choose it.\u201d\nMr. Yen said the change would cost Proton millions of dollars, in part because many of its users use its free services. Even though it wants to try alternative app stores and payment methods, the company would have no choice but to stay with Apple\u2019s current terms, he said.\nApple\u2019s new system could upend many developers\u2019 business models. More than 260,000 apps use a so-called freemium model where users pay nothing to download an app but have options to buy premium features, according to Data.ai, an app economy research firm.\nBecause only a fraction of subscribers pay for content or goods, developers say they couldn\u2019t afford to pay a 50-cent fee for every download.\nApple also included terms in its new policy that prevents developers from reversing their decisions. Once a company like Spotify or Proton decides to move over to Apple\u2019s new fee structure, there is no going back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s designed so that picking the new system is a massive risk for your business,\u201d Mr. Yen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive deterrent.\u201d"

        "title": "40 Years Ago, This Ad Changed the Super Bowl Forever",
        "fulltext": "Four decades ago, theSuper Bowlbecame the Super Bowl.\nIt wasn\u2019t because of anything that happened in the game itself: On Jan. 22, 1984, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated Washington 38-9 in Super Bowl XVIII, a contest that was mostly over before halftime. But during the broadcast on CBS, a 60-second commercial loosely inspired by a famous George Orwell novel shook up the advertising and the technology sectors without ever showing the product it promoted. Conceived by the Chiat/Day ad agency and directed by Ridley Scott, then fresh off making the seminal science-fiction noir \u201cBlade Runner,\u201dthe Apple commercial \u201c1984,\u201dwhich was intended to introduce the new Macintosh computer, would become one of the most acclaimed commercials ever made. It also helped to kick off \u2014 pun partially intended \u2014 the Super Bowl tradition of the big game serving as an annual showcase for gilt-edged ads from Fortune 500 companies. It all began with the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs\u2019s desire to take the battle with the company\u2019s rivals to a splashy television broadcast he knew nothing about.\nIn recent interviews, several of the people involved in creating the \u201c1984\u201d spot \u2014 Scott; John Sculley, then chief executive of Apple; Steve Hayden, a writer of the ad for Chiat/Day; Fred Goldberg, the Apple account manager for Chiat/Day; and Anya Rajah, the actor who famously threw the sledgehammer \u2014 looked back on how the commercial came together, its inspiration and the internal objections that almost kept it from airing. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.\nJOHN SCULLEYOn Oct. 19, 1983, we\u2019re all sitting around in Steve [Jobs\u2019s] building, the Mac building, and the cover of Businessweek says, \u201cThe Winner is \u2026 IBM.\u201d We were pretty deflated because this was the introduction of the IBM PCjr, and we hadn\u2019t even introduced the Macintosh yet.\nSTEVE HAYDENJobs said, \u201cI want something that will stop the world in its tracks.\u201d Our media director, Hank Antosz, said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s only one place that can do that \u2014 the Super Bowl.\u201d And Steve Jobs said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Super Bowl?\u201d [Antosz] said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a huge football game that attracts one of the largest audiences of the year.\u201d And [Jobs] said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Super Bowl. I don\u2019t think I know anybody who\u2019s seen a Super Bowl.\u201d\nFRED GOLDBERGThe original idea was actually done in 1982. We presented an ad [with] a headline, which was \u201cWhy 1984 Won\u2019t Be Like \u20181984,\u2019\u201d to Steve Jobs, and he didn\u2019t think the Apple III was worthy of that claim.\nSCULLEYThey said, \u201cA lot of people might want to do something with George Orwell\u2019s \u20181984.\u2019\u2019\u2019 If we can take advantage of the fact that we\u2019re introducing the Macintosh in January, maybe it can be so spectacular in our ads that no one else will even think about trying to copy us.\nHAYDENWe started imagining, well, what did we think 1984 was going to be like, based on Orwell\u2019s writing? And we thought it would be not so dissimilar from the world we were in at the time. Russia had invaded Afghanistan. It was impossible for the Russian people to get any kind of accurate information from their own news services about what was going on.\nGOLDBERGIt was Lee Clow, who was the creative director of Chiat/Day at that time, who oversaw the creation of the commercial that came out of that print concept.\nHAYDENGiven the sunny good nature of the average person, wouldn\u2019t this be a great tool to rebel against government overreach, especially in parts of the world where news is suppressed, manipulated or so tightly controlled it was useless to people?\nRIDLEY SCOTTI said, \u201cA computer for what reason? To write the shopping list? What\u2019s the matter with a pencil and paper?\u201d They laughed. How wrong I was. I should have bought stock then.\nHAYDENAt the time, Ridley was dealing with a lot of these issues about the meaning of the future, and how technologies could be twisted for good or for evil, because he was working on \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d\nSCOTTI was amazed that the agency was so brave to take a highbrow piece of literature to sell a box that they never talked about, never showed a picture, never said what it was for.\nHAYDENWe had originally envisioned this as a comical situation of drone-like people being hectored by a loudspeaker, told where to go, what to do, what room the meeting was in, and so forth. [Scott] pulled out a beautiful book of the movie \u201cMetropolis,\u201d so his inspiration, combined with our original storyboard of people being controlled by forces beyond their understanding, really helped us refocus the idea into technology as a tool for freedom.\nSCOTTI needed a man who is an extreme right-wing dictator. I want him on the screen doing his rant as an objector makes their way along the corridors of power being chased by the police.\nANYA RAJAHAll we knew was that they wanted to see us throw discus. I used to be a javelin and discus thrower at school, so I went along. I was pretty good, and I obviously looked the part.\nSCOTTI tend to, in my career, have very strong, powerful women. I looked for an athlete rather than a model.\nRAJAHRidley gave me an image of the hairstyle and color that he wanted on me, and sent me off to Vidal Sassoon in London to have it cut and colored. Even though I already had short blonde hair, he wanted it shorter and almost white-blonde. He was right \u2014 it was perfect for the part!\nSCOTTSome people thought it was a million-dollar project. It wasn\u2019t. I was very frugal. I tend to be on budget.\nHAYDENHe found a junked Vulcan bomber and had parts of that mounted on the walls and all around.\nGOLDBERG[The budget] was four commercials for $650,000. I figure that commercial was $350,000, maybe $400,000.\nSCOTTI couldn\u2019t afford the cast that I wanted, so I employed a whole bunch of National Front \u2014 extreme rightists who all had their heads shaved and tend not to have a job. I had 200 National Front in the studio. I think they were grateful for the work and had breakfast, lunch and dinner, and they got paid a bit.\nGOLDBERGWe paid them a total of $10,000 to sit there for three days having smoke blown in their face. They were really getting out of control at the end. The studio and the production house had security brought in. They had German shepherds to control these guys because they were throwing rocks at each other.\nRAJAHI had to have a bodyguard because they were all real skinheads.\nSCOTTI shot [the dictator] the day before on 16-millimeter, had it developed overnight, and then we projected it large on the screen, so it photographed badly, in a good way. I wanted it to look very deteriorated.\nHAYDENThe dictator\u2019s speech didn\u2019t exist in the original script of the commercial. Ridley Scott called me and said, \u201cIt would be very useful if you could write 30 or 60 seconds\u2019 worth of copy.\u201d I went out with my brother, who was actually teaching in China as a law professor. Between the two of us, we came up with little snippets of quotes from Mussolini, from Mao, from the People\u2019s Daily, from Goebbels, and from Hitler himself.\nSCOTTTrying to explain to that lot what I was doing was quite difficult, so I said, \u201cJust do as you\u2019re told. There\u2019s going to be a moment when this athlete flings a hammer at the screen. The screen will explode. I want you all to go \u2018ahhhh.\u2019\u201d And they did.\nRAJAHThrowing a real hammer was not going to be wise, so they ended up making a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 one, which I had to work with. It doesn\u2019t look like papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, so it worked out OK.\nGOLDBERGIt was a terrific piece of film. Everybody at the agency loved it.\nHAYDENSteve Jobs was excited but frightened by it. Steve Wozniakoffered to payto run the commercial himself.\nSCULLEYBefore the commercial ran, we had to take it to the board of directors. The board sees the commercial, and then there\u2019s just dead silence in the boardroom. They turn and look at me, and [a board member] says, \u201cYou\u2019re not really going to run that thing, are you?\u201d\nHAYDENAs the closing credits scrolled up, the chairman, Mike Markkula, put his head in his hands and kind of folded over the conference table, and then slowly straightened up and [proposed hiring a different ad agency].\nSCOTTI made it. I thought it was pretty good. But I was thinking, \u201cReally? They\u2019re going to run this on the Super Bowl? And we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s for?\u201d\nGOLDBERGI had them do a theater test. We get back the results, and it\u2019s the worst business commercial that they\u2019ve ever tested, in terms of persuasiveness.\nSCULLEYThe board said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think you should run it. Try to sell the time.\u201d\nGOLDBERGAnd it wasJay Chiatwho told us to drag our feet, basically, when we were told to sell off the time on the Super Bowl.\nHAYDENAt long last, it came down that we would run the \u201c1984\u201d commercial once.\nGOLDBERGEvery news show had clips of it. The commercial kept running and running and running for days after that.\nSCULLEYIt ran for free, over and over again.\nGOLDBERGThe value of the offshoot publicity is what many advertisers see as the bigger benefit.\nSCOTTI think the Super Bowl frenzy started there. Then, it was about $1 million a minute. Now, it\u2019s about $7 million a minute. [The average costfor a Super Bowl ad this year is actually twice that: $7 million for a 30-second spot.]\nSCULLEYWhen you\u2019re doing something that\u2019s never been done before, and it has a chance to change people\u2019s lives in terms of how they work and play and communicate, doing something that seems outlandish is a pretty good idea \u2014 if you do it right.\nHAYDENThe tools that were originally intended to help free you now are used as a way of enslaving you with conspiracy theories and unproved stories and unsourced news that\u2019s not really news. We\u2019re realizing Goebbels\u2019s idea, getting people so confused they have no idea what to believe other than an authority figure. In that sense, we failed."

        "title": "India\u2019s Quiet Push to Steal More of China\u2019s iPhone Business",
        "fulltext": "India is quietly grabbing from China more manufacturing of Apple\u2019s iPhones and other electronics gear.\nIt is happening in South Indian industrial areas on muddy plots that were once farmland.\nIn Sriperumbudur, people call Apple \u201cthe customer,\u201d not daring to say the name of a company that prizes its secrets.\nBut some things are too big to hide. Two gigantic dormitory complexes are springing up from the earth. Once finished, each will be a tight block of 13 buildings with 24 rooms per floor around an L-shaped hallway. Every one of those pink-painted rooms will have beds for six workers, all women. The two blocks will house 18,720 workers apiece.\nIt\u2019s a ready-made scene from Shenzhen or Zhengzhou, the Chinese cities famous for their iPhone production prowess. And it\u2019s no wonder.\nSriperumbudur, in the state of Tamil Nadu, is the home of the expanding Indian fortress of Foxconn, the Taiwanese-based company that has long played the largest role in producing iPhones. And as recently as 2019, about 99 percent of them were made in China.\nIndia, as part of a national manufacturing drive, is chipping away at that dominance, when many companies are looking to spread their work to countries other than China. An estimated 13 percent of the world\u2019s iPhones were assembled in India last year, and about three-quarters of those were made in Tamil Nadu.By next year, the volume produced in India is expected to double.\nBut despite almost 10 years of a \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative promoted by the country\u2019s powerful prime minister, Narendra Modi, manufacturing as a share of the economy has stalled out. At about 13 percent, it is a shade lower than when Mr. Modi took office in 2014, and far lower than that of China, or of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea when those Asian tigers took off.\nIndia desperately needs more skilled jobs, and factory work creates them like nothing else. Last year, India overtook China to become the world\u2019s most populous country, and its working-age population is speeding ahead. But turning that demographic bulge into an actual advantage means making India\u2019s workers more productive. Half of them still depend on small farming.\nTamil Nadu might point the way forward. The state of 72 million people is now succeeding in ways that have eluded India as a whole. The national government started subsidizing electronics manufacturing across the country in 2021, setting off a gold rush in places like Noida, next to New Delhi.\nBut for Tamil Nadu, that incentive is not an essential lure. T.R.B. Rajaa, Tamil Nadu\u2019s minister of industries, can rattle off the state\u2019s inbuilt advantages: schools, transport, engineering graduates.\n\u201cWe never compare our growth with other Indian states,\u201d he said. \u201cWe chart ourselves to the growth of Scandinavian countries and how we can beat that.\u201d\nMr. Rajaa and other boosters of Tamil Nadu are proud of the human capital their state has built up, and especially of its women. Many of them work in formal jobs, while few women in other states do: 43 percent of all Indian female factory employees work in Tamil Nadu, which is home to 5 percent of the national population.\nParts of Tamil Nadu are already working as industrial champions. A long belt of car and car-part manufacturers stretches down the coast from its capital, Chennai. In the western Coimbatore valley, factories specialize in die-casting and pump manufacturing. There is a knitwear cluster in Tiruppur, and the country\u2019s biggest maker of matchsticks is in Sivakasi.\nIt is striking that India is plunging into such high-end goods as the iPhone. India has never become internationally competitive making things like T-shirts or sneakers, getting its clock cleaned by smaller and formerly less developed countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam.\nThis is not the first time this century that India was expected to move up the ranks of high-value electronics manufacturing. Nor the first time that Tamil Nadu seemed like the best launchpad for it. In 2006, Finland\u2019s Nokia, then a cellphone colossus, built a big factory at the center of Sriperumbudur\u2019s government-planned industrial estate. It was supposed to make millions of phones a year, for India and the rest of the world. The smartphone, and the global financial crisis in 2009, knocked down those dreams.\nBut the roots never died. Sriperumbudur was initially attractive because of its experience in auto manufacturing. Hyundai had set up shop in 1996, soon after India opened up its economy to more foreign investment and Tamil Nadu formed its first state development agency. Glassmaking and basic electrical goods followed. After a lull, the old Nokia site was built over by Salcomp, a local company that makes high-end power chargers, now for companies like Apple. The plants of a dozen other known and rumored Apple suppliers have sprouted around it, along with Samsung, Dell and most other big multinational electronics companies.\nOn Friday, India\u2019s Republic Day, Young Liu, the chief executive of Foxconn, was in New Delhi to be awarded the Padma Bhushan, the country\u2019s third-highest civilian honor. \u201cLet\u2019s do our part,\u201d he said, \u201cfor manufacturing in India and for the betterment of society.\u201d\nA flourishing network of small, medium and large businesses contributes to Tamil Nadu\u2019s success. One of them is Sancraft Industries in Sriperumbudur, a company with about $5 million in revenue that makes molded plastic parts for a handful of companies that feed the iPhone machine.\nA company founder, Amit Gupta, said that Nokia had \u201cbrought the ecosystem here\u201d and that its Finnish engineers had done a lot to usher in global standards. His experience working with an early client, Schneider Electric, a French company, taught him how to integrate his operations with more recent arrivals from South Korea, Taiwan and China.\nAs host to an international supply chain, Tamil Nadu has drawn restaurants and grocery stores catering to Western and East Asian tastes. \u201cIt\u2019s like a small version of China here,\u201d said Mr. Gupta, who worked in Shenzhen 15 years ago.\nIn India and abroad, there is no shortage of excitement about the prospect of India\u2019s supplanting China in at least some part of global supply chains. By last year, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, was showing up in India with his palms pressed in namaste, inaugurating the country\u2019sfirst Apple stores.\nAll told, more than 130 Fortune 500 companies are doing business in Tamil Nadu.\nThe electronics campuses in Sriperumbudur look remarkably alike. Gardened grounds and parking lots filled with dozens of white buses separate low-slung assembly plants. The buses shuttle thousands of workers to and from their homes, in villages 30 to 60 miles away.\nInside one Apple supplier, blue-smocked workers in surgical masks walked past banks of white-aluminum-cladded machinery on paths marked by yellow arrows stuck on the floor. Low ceilings, long clear sightlines and placards exhorting good behavior in English and Tamil completed the effect.\nThere are more to come. Corning, the American glassmaker, is setting up a factory that could produce iPhone\u2019s Gorilla Glass screens, and Vietnam\u2019s VinFast Auto has announced a $2 billion facility to make electric vehicles.\nMr. Rajaa, the state industry minister, isn\u2019t stopping at $1,000 smartphones, either. He and other officials in Tamil Nadu are trying to attract more businesses making cheaper things, too, in greater volume. If the rest of the country could follow Tamil Nadu, India might be able to produce enough of the less-skilled jobs its young and growing population needs.\nMr. Rajaa spent the first week of January regaling foreign investors with plans that included a budding new industrial cluster, focused on non-leather footwear. About 140 miles south of Sriperumbudur, Nikes, Adidases and Crocs are just starting to roll off the lines in Perambalur."

        "fulltext": "Has Apple really crashed the car? The tech giant haskilled its electric vehicle projectas it pivots to artificial intelligence, prompting many observers to declare the venture a major failure for the company.\nHere\u2019s a contrarian thought: That critique misses a wider point about how Apple innovates, because the company has used the project to power a whole ecosystem of products and services that have been unmitigated successes.\nApple invested billions to build a self-driving car.Reports emerged about thesecret effort, code-named Project Titan, in 2014, and the company has never publicly acknowledged its existence. That said, it told staff on Tuesday that many of them would be redeployed.\nThere had been an wider internal debate about getting into the car business.An E.V. was seen by some as the ultimate data-collection device and as a way to diversify from the iPhone.\nBut others questioned what kind of margins cars would deliver, especially in a market locked in a price war. The answer: nothing like the profits packed into an iPhone or Apple Watch, which have helped Apple reach a near $3 trillion valuation.\nThe car project was an R.&D. lab on wheels.In the same year that speculation started about Project Titan, Apple released CarPlay. That has morphed into a software system that, as of 2022, had been installed in98 percent of new carsin the U.S., pulling more consumers into Apple\u2019s universe. Years of testing self-driving cars has also helped improve that platform, as well as providing data to inform Apple Maps and to push further into augmented reality.\nGeneral Motors\u2019 decision last year todrop CarPlayhasn\u2019t been widely copied. And former Apple executives are in charge of software atG.M.and atFord, suggesting that Apple\u2019sfingerprints will be all over carseven if it\u2019s not making one.\nApple investors seem happy.The share price rose afterBloomberg first reported the decision. Investors arepushing for more transparencyabout what Apple is doing on A.I., so they will probably be pleased about moves to improve those efforts.\nAnd Elon Musk, who once consideredselling Tesla to Apple, published apost on Xwith a saluting emoji and a lighted cigarette.\nMichigan voters send President Biden a warning. While Biden handily won the state\u2019s Democratic primary, more than 100,000votes for \u201cuncommitted\u201dwere cast to protest his support for Israel regarding the war in Gaza. That could spell danger for his re-election bid: He won the state in 2020 by just 150,000 votes.\nNew alarms sound on the U.S. economy.The Conference Board\u2019s consumer confidence indexdeclined for the first timesince November, with concerns about layoffs and the coming presidential election front and center. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs\u2019s C.E.O., David Solomon,cautioned investorsthat an economic \u201csoft landing\u201d was no certainty. (One bright spot: Congressional leaders appear increasingly optimistic that they canavert a partial government shutdownon Saturday.)\nGoogle\u2019s C.E.O. called recent artificial intelligence blunders \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201dSundar Pichai told employees that mistakes by the tech giant\u2019s A.I. image generation toolhad offended usersand that structural changes were needed. It\u2019s a setback for Google as tech giants rush out A.I. products despite well-known problems, includingserving up inaccuracies.\nStarbucks isadvancing talks with leaders of a growing unionizationpush within its company-owned stores in the U.S., a potentially huge shift in strategy and culture for the coffee giant.\nMore broadly, if even Starbucks \u2014 a poster child in recent years for resisting labor organizers \u2014 is willing to work with unions, could more of corporate America follow?\nIt\u2019s something of a reversal of Howard Schultz\u2019s efforts to prevent such organizing.For the former C.E.O., who turned a Seattle coffee shop chain into a global giant, unionization efforts that began in 2021 seemedalmost a personal affront, given that he had pioneered benefits such as giving part-time workers health care benefits, stock options and free college education.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in America is much bigger than Starbucks,\u201dSchultz said at the DealBook Summitin 2022. \u201cIf a company is as progressive as Starbucks, that\u2019s done so much and at the 100th percentile, can be threatened by a third party, then anyone can.\u201d\nThat led to sometimes bitter clashes,particularly as organizers managed to unionize workers at hundreds of stores. The Workers United union has accused Starbucks of repeated labor law violations, including retaliating against organizers. (The National Labor Relations Board hasrepeatedly ruled in favor of workers.)\nA group of unions is also seeking three seats on the Starbucks board, citing the anti-organization efforts as harmful to the company\u2019s business.\nSchultz\u2019s successor, Laxman Narasimhan, is more open to unions.In December, the company said that it would restart talks with Workers United in a bid to \u201cresume productive contract negotiations.\u201d\nOf note: Schultz remains a major shareholder in Starbucks, but he no longer holds an executive role.\nThere\u2019s a long way to go.Starbucks and Workers United are working on a \u201cfoundational framework\u201d for labor talks that could lead to new contracts. And while more and more employees are voting to organize \u2014 more than 20 locations filed petitions in one day last week \u2014 just a small fraction of stores are unionized.\nAll this may increase pressure on other union resisters,including Amazon, Apple and the outdoor gear retailer REI. If Starbucks is willing to bend \u2014 amidgrowing support for unionsamong Americans \u2014 they might feel pressured to as well.\nSam Bankman-Fried\u2019s legal team, his parents and some of their close allies have been arguing for months that the former poster boy of the crypto world shouldn\u2019t have to spend the rest of his life behind bars.\nIna legal filingissued late on Tuesday, they set outthe heart of their case: that creditors and customers can expect to be paid back and that he should serve no more than six and a half years in prison.\nBankman-Fried was convicted last year of one of the biggest financial crimes in history.Prosecutors said his actions cost investors and customers $8 billion, and have requested up to 100 years in prison, according to the filing.\nSuch a sentence would be \u201cflawed\u201d and \u201cgrotesque,\u201dBankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers argue in the filing. The legal team stresses that FTX customers will get every penny back, partly because of the sharp rebound in crypto asset prices. (DealBookasked this monthwhat a turnaround in FTX\u2019s finances would mean for the wider case.) They also point to the company\u2019s healthy holdings, including:\nA $500 million investment in Anthropic, an A.I. start-up. That stake is now worth up to $1.4 billion, the filing says.\nA stake in Solana, a crypto token, that was worth $4 billion as of Monday.\nIt\u2019s a long-shot strategy.Bankman-Fried\u2019s supporters ultimately want toreverse the convictionand initiate a public reappraisal of the FTX leadership team\u2019s role in the collapse. But criminal convictions like this are rarely overturned, and some legal experts say they believe Bankman-Fried will spend decades behind bars. (His legal team plans to file an appeal after the sentencing.)\nThe legal pushback is part of a broader strategy spearheaded by Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents.Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, professors at Stanford Law, have lined up former FTX employees to write supportive letters on their son\u2019s behalf. And two lawyers at Yale and Stanford who are close family friendspublished an essayarguing that FTX had enough assets to make its customers whole \u201call along.\u201d\nWarner Bros. Discovery has decided that buying Paramount Global wouldn\u2019t make sense after all. The media giant has reportedlybacked off a potential dealfor Shari Redstone\u2019s company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday,The Times\u2019s Edmund Lee writes for DealBook.\nIt probably didn\u2019t need to look too hard.DealBook has previouslylaid out the consof such a deal. Even if a soaring debt load and a combination of two businesses that still rely on declining TV assets weren\u2019t enough to put off investors, there was always a high probability that regulators would have stepped in.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean more media deals won\u2019t happen this year.The threat of Big Tech kickedoff a dizzying array of media tie-ups after AT&T\u2019s blockbuster purchase of Time Warner five years ago. (Reminder: The telecom behemoth bought the company, then sold it to Discovery, while Disney beat out Comcast to acquire most of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox.)\nComcast, Disney, Paramount and Warner still face a fundamental threat from Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Netflix. Think of it this way: Amazon generatedmore advertising dollarsin the fourth quarter thanWarnerandParamountdid all of last yearcombined.\nSilicon Valley is now muscling into sports programming,the life blood of pay television. And Netflix is dipping its toes into live coverage, having airedthe Screen Actors Guild Awardslast Saturday.\nThat partly explains the motivation behind the recently proposedsports streaming allianceto combine ESPN, Fox and Warner into one consumer offering. But even that deal has reportedlypiqued the interest of regulators.\nRedstone will want to cut a deal before things get even more difficult.She hasfielded interest from Skydance, the studio led by David Ellison, son of the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison. But that transaction could just be for her controlling interest, which might displease Paramount shareholders unless a special dividend were included in the deal.\nAnd then there\u2019s Brian Roberts at Comcast.He\u2019sprobably the one executive who successfully pulled off a big media deal in recent memory when he bought NBC Universal in 2009. Losing out on Fox doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s done with M.&A.\nDeals\nKlarna is reportedly pushing ahead with plans for an I.P.O. in New York this fall that would value the Swedish buy-now-pay-later companyat roughly $20 billion.

        "title": "A.I. Promises Give Tech Earnings a Jolt",
        "fulltext": "Earlier this week, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta endured agrilling on Capitol Hilland publicly apologized to relatives of victims of online abuse. Little more than a day later, he had a lot to crow about, as his business delivered some of itsbest quarterly earningsin years.\nMeta\u2019s results illustrate how the most recent earnings season has gone for Big Tech: a mostly positive period in which companies that could claim the benefits of artificial intelligence and cost-cutting were hailed the most on Wall Street.\nMeta shot the lights out.After years of facing questions about its ad business and its ability to cope with scandals, the parent of Facebook and Instagram reported that fourth-quarter profits tripled from a year ago. A.I. was credited for some of that, with the technology helping make its core ad business more effective. So too was cost-cutting, which included tens of thousands of layoffs as part of the company\u2019s self-described \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d\nMeta\u2019s profit was so good that the company will soon start paying stock dividends for the first time (which could total$700 million a yearfor Zuckerberg alone) and announced a $50 billion buyback. It\u2019s a sign that the tech giant is \u201ccoming of age,\u201d according to one analyst, joining Microsoft and Apple in making regular payouts to investors.\nZuckerberg pledged more investment in A.I. \u2014 \u201cExpect us to continue investing aggressively in this area,\u201d he said on an earnings call \u2014 and the company said it had largely concluded its cost cuts. But some analysts said that Meta will eventually have to show a return on that spending.\nAmazon also touted its A.I. initiatives.Much ofits earnings callwas spent talking about Rufus, a new smart assistant intended to help shoppers find what they\u2019re looking for. (It may also allow Amazon to reduce ad spending on Google and social media platforms.)\nIt\u2019s part of a bid by the e-commerce giant to show it\u2019s not just playing A.I. catch-up to Microsoft and Google. Amazon reported steady growth in cloud computing, a proxy for selling A.I. services to corporate clients, with the division growing 13 percent in the quarter. That met analysts\u2019 expectations, but that growth is less than half that reported by competing divisions at Microsoft and Google.\nApple resumed sales growth, though China weighed on its results.Revenue rose 2 percentin the quarter, the first quarterly increase in a year, powered by sales of iPhones and services like Apple Music. But shares in Apple fell in after-hours trading, as investors worried about slowing revenue growth in China, the company\u2019s second-biggest market, where it\u2019s confronting resurgent competition from Huawei and a struggling economy.\nEven though Apple\u2019s product du jour is its new Vision Reality Pro, itteased the rolloutof new A.I. initiatives this year,amid concernsthat it\u2019s late to the game. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for Apple with generative A.I. and with AI, without getting into many more details,\u201d Tim Cook, its C.E.O., told analysts.\nSenators accuse consulting firms of withholding information on their Saudi work.The C.E.O.s of four advisory businesses \u2014 Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey, M. Klein & Company and Teneo \u2014 are scheduled totestify on Capitol Hillnext week, after the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said theyfailed to complywith congressional subpoenas. The subcommittee is examining Saudi Arabia\u2019s efforts to exert influence through its investments in the U.S.\nCommercial property troubles weigh on banks worldwide.Shares of lenders\u2014 New York Community Bancorp, Aozora Bank in Japan and Julius Baer in Switzerland \u2014 fell on Thursday after each detailed their exposure on soured loans to real estate companies. It\u2019s the latest sign of a reckoning among lenders with the decline of the commercial property market, as office vacancies remain well below prepandemic levels.\nA missing Chinese deal maker resigns.Fan Bao, who was detained by Beijing authorities last year, has resigned as chairman and C.E.O. of China Renaissance, the investment bank disclosed today. The disappearance of Bao, one of China\u2019s most important and well-connected deal makers, shocked the country\u2019s business community and raised questions about how far Beijing would go to bring the private sector to heel.\nVolvo cuts funding to its electric car joint venture.The Swedish automaker essentially plans tocut ties to Polestar, a start-up it created with Geely of China, amid ongoing losses at the business. The move further raises questions about how major car companies are dealing with a slowdown in sales of electric vehicles, which are weighing on their earnings.\nAmer, the Chinese-owned parent group of the sportswear brands Wilson and Arc\u2019teryx, made amuted debuton the New York Stock Exchange this week, raising less money than it had hoped.\nBut its struggles raise questions about the prospects of a bigger company linked to China: Shein, the fast-fashion giant that is also planning to go public in the U.S.\nAmer priced its I.P.O. at $13 a share,well below its $16 to $18 target range, raising about $1.4 billion. Although the Americas and Europe account for a bigger share of sales, unidentified I.P.O. investors told Reuters that they were worried about thecompany\u2019s reliance on China: The country accounted for nearly 20 percent of Amer\u2019s sales last year, up from 8 percent in 2022.\nSheinfiled for an I.P.O.late last year.It was most recently valued by private-market investors at $60 billion. At that level, it would be the biggest company to go public in the U.S. since Uber in 2019.\nThough Shein is now headquartered in Singapore, the company was founded in China \u2014 and, perhaps more important, makes many of its garments there.\nThe companies are vastly different. Shein operates almost like a social media app, while Amer is closer to a luxury company. But Shein also faces a raft of challenges linked to China,from being accused of allowingcopied designs to proliferateon its platform to use of forced labor in its supply chains.\nAll that bad news is weighing on its backers, some of whom are reportedly trying to sell their sharesat a 30 percent discount.\nThere are some parallels between Shein and Amer, according to Matt Kennedy, a senior strategist at the research firm Renaissance Capital.\u201cBoth are apparel companies with the China angle, he told DealBook.\nStill, there are big differences between the two businesses,including price points between the items they sell. A Wilson tennis racket can cost $200, while a Shein dress can cost as little as $10, meaning the fast-fashion retailer could better survive belt-tightening by consumers.\n\u2014John Coffee, a professor at Columbia University Law School, on why a Delaware judge\u2019s ruling to void Elon Musk\u2019s pay package worth more than $50 billion won\u2019t lead to an exodus of companies from the state. Following the ruling, Musk said companies shouldn\u2019t incorporate in Delaware.\nMcKinsey partners havere-elected Bob Sternfelsas the consulting giant\u2019s global managing partner \u2014 but only just, after he was thrust into a runoff following two rounds of voting.\nHis hard-won victory on Thursday shows the level of internal dissatisfaction at McKinsey and raises questions about how the firm is governed.\nSternfels beat out Rodney Zemmel,the head of the firm\u2019s fast-growing digital practice. First elected in 2021, Sternfels had replaced Kevin Sneader, who was ousted after just one term amid controversies over McKinsey\u2019s work on opioid makers and other divisive clients.\nMcKinsey has had to retrench in the past year,cutting 1,400 back-office jobs, reducing the number of new partners it appointed, curtailing some of its bankruptcy business amid scrutiny over its work and delaying the start of new M.B.A. recruits.\nSome McKinsey partners have been unhappy with how Sternfels has managed those challenges, accusing him ofmishandling the restructuring and layoffsand relying too much on a small team rather than the broader partnership.\nThere may be a bigger problem for McKinsey: its partnership.The firm\u2019s upper ranks now total about 750 partners, making it harder to reach consensus on major issues \u2014 especially in turbulent times.\nDeals\nIn activist-investing news: Elliott Management gained a board seat atEtsy, reportedly after amassing a 13 percent stake.

        "title": "Why Is Big Tech Still Cutting Jobs?",
        "fulltext": "After a year of big layoffs, job cuts at the tech industry\u2019s largest companies trickled into the first month of 2024.\nGoogle started the year withlayoffs of several hundred employeesand a promise of more cuts to come. Amazon followed bytrimming hundreds of jobs in its Prime Videodepartment. Metaquietly thinned out middle management. Microsoft alsocut 1.900 jobs in its video game division.\nThe layoffs continued even as sales and profits jumped and share prices spiked. That disconnect, tech insiders and analysts say, is reflective of an industry facing two big challenges: coming to terms with frenetic work force expansion during the pandemic while also making an aggressive move into building artificial intelligence.\nNow, instead of hiring thousands of people every quarter, the companies are spending billions to build A.I. technology that they believe could one day be worth trillions.\nMark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Meta, said in a call with analysts last week that his company had to lay off employees and control costs \u201cso we can invest in these long-term, ambitious visions around A.I.\u201d He added that he had come to realize that \u201cwe operate better as a leaner company.\u201d\nFrom the end of 2019 to 2023, tech companies scrambled to keep up with an explosion of consumer demand, as people stuck at home splurged on new computers and spent much more time online. Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, added a total of more than 900,000 jobs.\nWhen that boom ended, they were forced to adjust. Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Apple cut about 112,000 jobs from their respective peaks in 2021 and 2022. But they were still much bigger and more profitable than before the pandemic began.\nToday, the five companies employ 2.16 million people, 71 percent more than they had before the pandemic. Combined, they generated $1.63 trillion in sales in their most recent fiscal years, about 81 percent more revenue than five years earlier.\nWall Street has rewarded them. Over the past year, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Google and Apple have gained nearly $3.5 trillion in market value.\nEmployment in the broader tech industry, despite notable cuts at a number of other companies, is still positioned for a rebound. In January, tech delivered its second month of job growth, adding 18,000 workers, according to CompTIA, a technology education and research organization. Its unemployment rate of 3.3 percent is below thenational average of 3.7 percent.\n\u201cWe go through these cycles where you see this intense focus on innovation and then the pendulum swings and there\u2019s an intense focus on the bottom line,\u201d said Tim Herbert, CompTIA\u2019s chief research officer. \u201cBut when I read that Amazon is cutting back on Alexa workers or Google is cutting staff on its Pixel phone, it tells me there is a focus on margins. They\u2019re trimming where they can and redeploying resources.\u201d\nHeadcounts at five major tech companies\n0.5\n1\n1.5 million\n\u201919\n\u201920\n\u201921\n\u201922\n\u201923\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n200,000\n\u201919\n\u201920\n\u201921\n\u201922\n\u201923\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n\u201919\n\u201920\n\u201921\n\u201922\n\u201923\n50,000\n100,000\n150,000\n\u201919\n\u201920\n\u201921\n\u201922\n\u201923\n20,000\n40,000\n60,000\n80,000\n\u201919\n\u201920\n\u201921\n\u201922\n\u201923\nSources: Companies\u2019 annual reports\nBy Ella Koeze\nGenerative artificial intelligence has altered everyone\u2019s business priorities. The technology, which can answer questions, create images and write code, becamean overnight sensation after OpenAI\u2019s chatbot, ChatGPT, explodedin popularity.\nTech\u2019s biggest companies are rushing to hire engineers to build A.I. systems. Last year, there were 180,000 job postings in the United States related to A.I., including roles in software development, semiconductor engineering and cloud computing, according to CompTIA. The number of A.I. job openings has expanded this year.\nThose employees are helping Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta improve chatbots and build other A.I. systems. Apple is hiring for A.I. engineers, as the company develops its own A.I. offering to release later this year.\n\u201cOur M.O., if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves,\u201d Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said on a call with analysts last week. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some things that we\u2019re incredibly excited about.\u201d\nThe companies are spending billions of dollars on the expensive chips and supercomputers necessary to train and build A.I. systems. By the end of the year, Meta expects to have purchased 350,000 of specialized chips from the chip maker Nvidia, which cost an estimated $30,000 each.\nThe push into generative A.I. has coincided with cuts elsewhere. Google\u2019s layoffs reduced the number of people working on augmented reality technology. Meta, which laid off nearly 20,000 people last year, has been cutting some of its program managers, who oversee different projects and are responsible for keeping teams on schedule.\nOver two years, 2020 and 2021, Amazon doubled its work force to 1.6 million employees as it tried to keep up with a surge of e-commerce orders. The hiring included increasing the number of corporate jobs to 380,000 from 200,000. It has since cut about 30,000 corporate jobs and about 50,000 other jobs, according to a person with knowledge of the changes, and its leadership has made clear that those jobs won\u2019t return any time soon.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to hold the line on head count,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the chief financial officer of Amazon, said during a media call last week.\nAfter laying off more than a thousand employees in January, Google warned employees that rolling layoffs could continue through the year. The exception would be bringing aboard top engineers, Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, said during a call with analysts last week.\nIn contrast with its peers, Apple showed restraint with hiring during the pandemic. But last year, as sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs dropped, the company began to shrink its work force. For the first time in at least 15 years, it reported that its total number of employees declined, even as it avoided making major layoffs.\nThe 3,000 fewer jobs that Apple reported at the end of its most recent fiscal year were eliminated largely through attrition, and by encouraging some managers to give tougher annual reviews, according to three people with knowledge of the company\u2019s strategy.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment.\nMicrosoft is the only tech company that didn\u2019t report a reduction in its total number of employees. The company employed 221,000 people at the end of its 2023 fiscal year, equal to its post-pandemic peak.\nInvestors have rewarded Microsoft\u2019s stability. Last month, itdethroned Appleas the world\u2019s most valuable company. Its market value is now more than $3 trillion.\nNico Grant,Mike IsaacandKaren Weisecontributed reporting."

        "title": "Can Fitness Trackers Really Make You Fitter?",
        "fulltext": "Over the past few years, upping your exercise game has started to feel like getting a degree in data science.\nThere are glucose monitors and sweat patches, sleep trackers and step trackers, heart rate monitors and cadence sensors. There are watches and rings and armbands and chest straps and clip-on monitors that promise to estimate yourVO2 max, your breathing and more.\nEven if you don\u2019t use a wearable, if you carry a smartphone, you likely have much of the same data accessible through a health app. While tracking your workouts is not new, there is now an overwhelming amount of data \u2014 the kind once reserved for professional athletes \u2014 available to everyday consumers.\nBut does more data make a better, faster, stronger, healthier human? Can these tools really motivate you, lead to a better annual physical or maximize your workout benefits?\nNot all data is good or helpful, doctors, exercise physiologists and coaches say, and having more data does not mean having a more effective workout. The real questions surround not the wearable, but the wearer.\nA wearable is any tracking device worn on your body that measures one or more bodily functions, whether it\u2019s heart rate, sleep time, step count or respiration. Most, like those made by Fitbit, Garmin, Coros, Whoop andOura, are not considered medical devices and are not regulated or evaluated by the Food and Drug Administrations. Indeed, recently, theF.D.A. warned consumersthat wearable devices claiming to measure or estimate blood sugar without piercing the skin should not be used for diabetes management.\nRegardless, many devices include metrics that are usually collected in a laboratory setting.\nFor instance, one measurement that can be useful for athletes is your VO2 max, the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can use during intense exercise. The number is usually determined in a lab by exercising at various intensities while wearing a mask that records oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Wearables, however, claim to infer this number using an equation based on your heart rate, which should be taken with a grain of salt, experts said.\nOther data, like step counts and distance traveled, aregenerallymore accurate.\n\u201cActivity trackers are facilitators, not instigators, of behavior change,\u201d said David R. Bassett, Jr. a professor emeritus of kinesiology, recreation and sport studies at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.\nIn other words, the device alone will not make your workouts easier or improve your sleep cycles. But they can help you identify trends in your exercise regimen and track your progress if you are trying to improve.\nResearcherswhohavestudiedtheimpactofwearablesonbehaviorhave indeed found a correlation between using them and increased movement. But, Dr. Bassett added, there\u2019s a sense of accountability when researchers are around.\n\u201cWearables are very good at changing behavior if they are done in the context of a physical activity intervention study,\u201d said Dr. Bassett, who haslong studied wearables.\nThat desire to impress people could also be beneficial, according researchers. The app Strava, which tracks workouts and allows users to share their activities, has become ubiquitous for just that. Competitive runners and cyclists often joke: \u201cIf it\u2019s not onStrava, did it happen?\u201d\nThe challenge for athletes looking to up their game with data is finding thetype of information that is most helpful, and determining how often they need to reference it. For professionals and those who are new to working out, less is more.\n\u201cA beginner and a professional athlete oftentimes use the devices incredibly similarly,\u201d said Darian Allberry, head of user engagement at Coros, a GPS watch company. They want to know how far they\u2019ve gone and how fast they\u2019ve traveled. Beyond that, extra data can be distracting, he added.\nEarlier this month,Sara Hall, a professional marathon runner competing in the U.S. Olympic marathon trials, actuallythrew away her GPS watchmidrace to avoid distraction. Similarly, for beginner runners, it\u2019s more important to learn to listen to your body\u2019s signals \u2014 fatigue, aches, bursts of energy \u2014 than to track your pace or heart rate.\nIt\u2019s middle of the pack athletes \u2014 runners and bikers looking to hit a personal best or reach a new milestone \u2014 who may get the biggest benefits from wearables, Mr. Allberry said.\nIf you are hoping to run a faster marathon and want to try moderating your pace based onheart rate \u201czones,\u201d for example, a wearable can help you do so. Bikers who plan their training based onpower zonescould also use a tracker. If you buy one, though, be sure itfits your needs.\nBut if you are just trying to get out the door more, a device\u2019s data dump probably isn\u2019t entirely necessary, Dr. Ethan Weiss, a physician at the University of California, San Francisco, said.\n\u201cWe have this attachment to data, we all love data,\u201d Dr. Weiss said. \u201cWe love to measure things for the sake of measuring things.\u201d\nSometimes he tells his patients that a different item attached at your wrist could better pull you toward more activity.\n\u201cHave you considered getting a dog?\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple Sees First Quarterly Revenue Increase in a Year",
        "fulltext": "Apple has had plenty of challenges to start the year. The Apple Watchhas been alteredby patent lawsuits, theApp Store has come under firefrom developers, and the iPhone has facedrenewed competitionin China.\nTopping it all off, the companywas recently dethronedas the undisputed king of the stock market when Microsoft replaced it as the world\u2019s most valuable public company.\nBut on Thursday, the tech giant showed the versatility and strength of its business, reporting that sales rose 2 percent to $119.58 billion during the three months that ended in December. It was the first quarterly revenue increase for Apple in a year and helped the company deliver $33.92 billion in profit during the period, a 13 percent increasefrom a year earlier.\nThe results showed that Apple had the ability to overcome a slowdown in device sales by getting its enormous customer base to buy more apps and services, such as Apple Music. The company said sales of software and services rose 11 percent to $23.12 billion during the period.\nShares of Apple fell about 3percent in after-hours trading, even though the company exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations for $117.99 billion in sales. The company said sales in the current quarter would be down from a year ago, disappointing Wall Street analysts who had expected a modest increase.\nThough its signature products, the iPhone and iPad, are more than a decade old, Apple said the number of its devices in use around the world last year had increased by 200 million from the two billion it reported a year ago. Investors watch that figure closely because as iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches proliferate, more people are willing to pay Apple for things like cloud-computing storage.\nThe iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s annual revenue, was the only Apple device to post an increase in sales during the quarter. Apple\u2019s release of a new, titanium version of the device last year helped it increase the number of smartphones it sold by five million, according to Canalys, a market research firm. The uptick lifted iPhone sales 6 percent to $69.7 billion.\nBut sales of iPads and wearables such as Apple Watches declined, and Mac sales were flat, weighing down the company\u2019s total device sales, which were almost the same as a year earlier at $96.46 billion.\nApple spent the days before Christmaswarning customers that it was going to have to suspendsales of its Apple Watch because it lost a patent case over the device\u2019s pulse oximetry feature. To continue sales, it overhauled the software of its new watches and removed the feature.\nIn China, Apple\u2019s second-biggest market, the company is navigatinga slowing economyand increased competition. Chinese consumers are cutting back on spending, while Huawei, China\u2019s cellphone giant, has released a smartphone with high-quality cameras and lower prices than Apple. To keep pace, Apple has begun discounting iPhones in China.\nSales in China fell 13 percent to $20.82 billion as iPhone totals dipped slightly and sales of other products faded, the company said. Analysts had expected sales of $23.33 billion.\nApple\u2019s growth lagged the gains posted by other tech giants. On Tuesday,Microsoft said its quarterly revenue had risen 18 percentto $62 billion, whileAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, reported a 13 percentincrease in sales.\nThe value of those companies has soared as they have embraced generative artificial intelligence, which Apple has been slower to take on. During a call with analysts, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said the company was spending \u201ca tremendous amount of time and effort\u201d on artificial intelligence.\n\u201cOur M.O., if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some things that we\u2019re incredibly excited about that we\u2019ll be talking about later this year.\u201d\nApple has instead beenfocused on the release of an augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. The company put the device, which costs $3,500, on sale in mid-January and sold out of its first batch of about 200,000 headsets, according to analysts\u2019 estimates. It will begin shipping the device on Friday.\n\u201cThere\u2019s already so much excitement behind this product,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.\u201d"
