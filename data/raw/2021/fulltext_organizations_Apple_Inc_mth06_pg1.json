        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House lawmakers on Friday introduced sweeping antitrust legislation aimed at restraining the power ofBig Techand staving off corporate consolidation. If passed, the bills would be the most ambitious update to monopoly laws in decades.\nThe bills \u2014 five in total \u2014 take direct aim atAmazon, Apple,Facebook and Googleand their grip on online commerce, information and entertainment. The proposals would make it easier to break up businesses that used their dominance in one area to get a stronghold in another, would create new hurdles for acquisitions of nascent rivals and would empower regulators with more funds to police companies.\nThe legislation could reshape the way the companies operate. Facebook and Google, for instance, could have a higher bar to prove that any mergers aren\u2019t anticompetitive. Amazon could face more scrutiny when selling its own branded products like toilet paper and clothing. Apple could have a harder time entering new lines of business that are promoted on its App Store.\n\u201cRight now, unregulated tech monopolies have too much power over our economy. They are in a unique position to pick winners and losers, destroy small businesses, raise prices on consumers and put folks out of work,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of theantitrustsubcommittee. \u201cOur agenda will level the playing field and ensure the wealthiest, most powerful tech monopolies play by the same rules as the rest of us.\u201d\nThe introduction of the bills, which have some bipartisan support, is the most aggressive challenge yet from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley\u2019s tech giants, which have thrived for years without regulation or much restraint on the expansion of their business. Last year, the antitrust subcommittee releaseda scathing report about the industry after a 16-month investigation, declaring that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google engaged in a variety of monopolistic behavior. The proposals released on Friday try to address the concerns detailed in the report.\nOver the past decade, dozens of bills addressing data privacy, speech liability and children\u2019s online safety have failed. But efforts to curb the dominance of the biggest tech companies have gained broad support in recent years. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission during the Trump administration accusedGoogleandFacebookof anticompetitive practices and filed lawsuits that are expected to be fought for years. Democrats and Republicans point to the dominance of a handful of firms as a root cause for the spread of disinformation, inequality in labor and wages, and haphazard rules for speech across the internet.\nThe tech giants face similarchallenges to their power across the globe, includingantitrust investigations in Europeand new legislation in Australia and India to curb their power.\n\u201cThese are just the type of new laws we need to really address the problem of gatekeeper power by dominant digital platforms,\u201d said Charlotte Slaiman, the competition director for Public Knowledge, a public interest group. \u201cBig tech firms have so many powerful tools to protect their monopolies. These bills would give antitrust enforcers a few more powerful tools to open up digital platform markets for competition.\u201d\nThe bills set up a showdown with the tech industry\u2019s powerful influence armies. Over the past decade, the industry has assembled the largest group of lobbyists in Washington, and the companies sponsor think tanks, fund academic papers and employ top antitrust litigation firms to defend their businesses.\nSome of the proposals are likely to gain widespread support among lawmakers, including one focused on getting more funding for antitrust agencies through higher merger fees; the Senate recently passed a similar bill. Another bill that could gain traction would give consumers the ability to take their digital history to other websites, which would weaken the stranglehold that large companies like Facebook have over personal data.\nBut other bills will be harder to pass. One would make it illegal for a company like Google, which has a dominant search engine, to own another business that relied heavily on online search. For example, the company would not be allowed to favor search results for its YouTube video service under the new law, and it could be required to spin off the video business if it favored it over competitors. Another bill would prohibit a dominant company from using its weight to exclude rivals and from demanding conditions, like buying goods and services from the company, of others that wanted access to its platform.\nAdam Kovacevich, the head of Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group with Big Tech members, said consumers would be deprived of popular products if the bills succeeded.\n\u201cBanning conveniences like Amazon Basics brand batteries, Apple\u2019s Find my Phone tool or Google Maps appearing in Google search results are ideas that would spark a consumer backlash,\u201d he said.\nFacebook and Google declined to comment. Amazon and Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comments.\nSome smaller tech companies hailed the bills.\nRoku, the online streaming device maker, said in a statement that the largest tech companies \u201cflagrantly ignore\u201d existing antitrust laws and harmed consumers.\n\u201cAn aggressive set of reforms is needed to prevent a future where these monopolists further abuse consumer choice and hamper access to innovative and independent products,\u201d the company said.\nAntitrust experts say the bills would embolden enforcers, who have become constrained by court decisions that have narrowed interpretations of century-old antitrust laws.\n\u201cThis is a reaction to the fact that our antitrust laws have been construed so narrowly by the Supreme Court,\u201d said Eleanor M. Fox, a professor of law at New York University. \u201cBecause of this problem, it is very appropriate for Congress to be stepping in to prohibit and determine what\u2019s bad and what\u2019s good for markets.\u201d\nRepublicans are divided on aspects of the bills. Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, a Republican on the subcommittee, has been a consistent critic of the power of Big Tech. But he has also insisted on narrowing aspects of the laws to ensure that smaller companies aren\u2019t swept up in the changes.\nMr. Buck, like other Republicans, has been particularly critical of the power of social media firms over speech and has alleged censorship of conservative political figures by Facebook and Google.\n\u201cThis legislation breaks up Big Tech\u2019s monopoly power to control what Americans see and say online,\u201d he said, \u201cand fosters an online market that encourages innovation and provides American small businesses with a fair playing field. Doing nothing is not an option. We just act now.\u201d"

        "title": "Hunting Leaks, Trump Officials Focused on Democrats in Congress",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As theJustice Departmentinvestigated who was behindleaks of classified informationearly in the Trump administration, it took a highly unusual step: Prosecutors subpoenaedApplefor data from the accounts of at least two Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, aides and family members. One was a minor.\nAll told, the records of at least a dozen people tied to the committee were seized in 2017 and early 2018, including those of RepresentativeAdam B. Schiffof California, then the panel\u2019s top Democrat and now its chairman, according to committee officials and two other people briefed on the inquiry. Representative Eric Swalwell of California said in an interview Thursday night that he had also been notified that his data had been subpoenaed.\nProsecutors, under the beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, were hunting for the sources behind news media reports about contacts between Trump associates and Russia. Ultimately, the data and other evidence did not tie the committee to the leaks, and investigators debated whether they had hit a dead end and some even discussed closing the inquiry.\nBut William P. Barr revived languishingleak investigationsafter he became attorney general a year later. He moved a trusted prosecutor from New Jersey with little relevant experience to the main Justice Department to work on the Schiff-related case and about a half-dozen others, according to three people with knowledge of his work who did not want to be identified discussing federal investigations.\nThe zeal in the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to hunt leakers led to the extraordinary step of subpoenaing communications metadata from members of Congress \u2014 a nearly unheard-of move outside of corruption investigations. While Justice Department leak investigations are routine, current and former congressional officials familiar with the inquiry said they could not recall an instance in which the records of lawmakers had been seized as part of one.\nMoreover, just as it didin investigating news organizations, the Justice Department secured a gag order on Apple that expired this year, according to a person familiar with the inquiry, so lawmakers did not know they were being investigated until Apple informed them last month.\nProsecutors also eventually secured subpoenas for reporters\u2019 records to try to identify their confidential sources, a move that department policy allows only after all other avenues of inquiry are exhausted.\nThe subpoenas remained secret until the Justice Department disclosed them in recent weeks to the news organizations \u2014 The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN \u2014 revelations that set off criticism that the government was intruding on press freedoms.\nThe gag orders and records seizures show how aggressively the Trump administration pursued the inquiries while Mr. Trump declared war on the news media and perceived enemies whom he routinely accused of disclosing damaging information about him, including Mr. Schiff andJames B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director whom prosecutors focused on in the leak inquiry involving Times records.\n\u201cNotwithstanding whether there was sufficient predication for the leak investigation itself, including family members and minor children strikes me as extremely aggressive,\u201d said David Laufman, a former Justice Department official who worked on leak investigations. \u201cIn combination with former President Trump\u2019s unmistakable vendetta against Congressman Schiff, it raises serious questions about whether the manner in which this investigation was conducted was influenced by political considerations rather than purely legal ones.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokesman declined to comment, as did Mr. Barr and a representative for Apple.\nAs the years wore on, some officials argued in meetings that charges were becoming less realistic, former Justice Department officials said: They lacked strong evidence, and a jury might not care about information reported years earlier.\nThe Trump administration also declassified some of the information, making it harder for prosecutors to argue that publishing it had harmed the United States. And the president\u2019s attacks on Mr. Schiff and Mr. Comey would allow defense lawyers to argue that any charges were attempts to wield the power of law enforcement against Mr. Trump\u2019s enemies.\nBut Mr. Barr directed prosecutors to continue investigating, contending that the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division had allowed the cases to languish, according to three people briefed on the cases. Some cases had nothing to do with leaks about Mr. Trump and involved sensitive national security information, one of the people said. But Mr. Barr\u2019s overall view of leaks led some people in the department to eventually see the inquiries as politically motivated.\nMr. Schiff called the subpoenas for data on committee members and staff another example of Mr. Trump using the Justice Department as a \u201ccudgel against his political opponents and members of the media.\u201d\n\u201cIt is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a statement. \u201cThe politicization of the department and the attacks on the rule of law are among the most dangerous assaults on our democracy carried out by the former president.\u201d\nHe said the department informed him in May that the investigation into his committee was closed. But he called on its independent inspector general to investigate the leak case and others that \u201csuggest the weaponization of law enforcement,\u201d an appeal joined by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\nSoon after Mr. Trump took office in 2017, press reports based on sensitive or classified intelligence threw the White House into chaos. They detailed conversations between the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time and Mr. Trump\u2019s top aides, the president\u2019s pressuring of the F.B.I. and other matters related to the Russia investigation.\nThe White House was adamant that the sources be found and prosecuted, and the Justice Department began a broad look at national security officials from the Obama administration, according to five people briefed on the inquiry.\nWhile most officials were ruled out, investigators opened cases that focused on Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, the people said. Prosecutors also began to scrutinize the House Intelligence Committee, including Mr. Schiff, as a potential source of the leaks. As the House\u2019s chief intelligence oversight body, the committee has regular access to sensitive government secrets.\nJustice Department National Security Division officials briefed the deputy attorney general\u2019s office nearly every other week on the investigations, three former department officials said.\nIn 2017 and 2018, a grand jury subpoenaed Apple and another internet service provider for the records of the people associated with the Intelligence Committee. They learned about most of the subpoenas last month, when Apple informed them that their records had been shared but did not detail the extent of the request, committee officials said. A second service provider had notified one member of the committee\u2019s staff about such a request last year.\nIt was not clear why family members or children were involved, but the investigators could have sought the accounts because they were linked or on the theory that parents were using their children\u2019s phones or computers to hide contacts with journalists.\nThere do not appear to have been similar grand jury subpoenas for records of members or staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to another official familiar with the matter. A spokesman for Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee did not respond to a question about whether they were issued subpoenas. The Justice Department has declined to tell Democrats on the committee whether any Republicans were investigated.\nApple turned over only metadata and account information, not photos, emails or other content, according to the person familiar with the inquiry.\nAfter the records provided no proof of leaks, prosecutors in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Washington discussed ending that piece of their investigation. But Mr. Barr\u2019s decision to bring in an outside prosecutor helped keep the case alive.\nACNN reportin August 2019 about another leak investigation said prosecutors did not recommend to their superiors that they charge Mr. Comey over memos that he wrote and shared about his interactions with Mr. Trump, which were not ultimately found to contain classified information.\nMr. Barr was wary of how Mr. Trump would react, according to a person familiar with the situation. Indeed, Mr. Trump berated the attorney general, who defended the department, telling the president that there was no case against Mr. Comey to be made, the person said. But an investigationremained openinto whether Mr. Comey had leaked other classified information about Russia.\nIn February 2020, Mr. Barr placed the prosecutor from New Jersey, Osmar Benvenuto, into the National Security Division. His background was in gang and health care fraud prosecutions.\nThrough a Justice Department spokesman, Mr. Benvenuto declined to comment.\nMr. Benvenuto\u2019s appointment was in keeping with Mr. Barr\u2019s desireto keep mattersof great interestto the White Housein the hands ofa small circleof trusted aides and officials.\nWith Mr. Benvenuto involved in the leak inquiries, the F.B.I. questioned Michael Bahar, a former House Intelligence Committee staff member who had gone into private practice in May 2017. The interview, conducted in late spring of 2020, did not yield evidence that led to charges.\nProsecutors also redoubled efforts to find out who had leaked material related to Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser. Details about conversations he had in late 2016 with the Russian ambassador at the time, Sergey I. Kislyak, appeared in news reports in early 2017 and eventually helped prompt both his ouster and federal charges against him. The discussions had also been considered highly classified because the F.B.I. had used a court-authorized secret wiretap of Mr. Kislyak to monitor them.\nBut John Ratcliffe, the director of national intelligence and close ally of Mr. Trump\u2019s, seemed to damage the leak inquiry in May 2020, when he declassified transcripts of the calls. The authorized disclosure would have made it more difficult for prosecutors to argue that the news stories had hurt national security.\nSeparately, one of the prosecutors whom Mr. Barr had directed to re-examine the F.B.I.\u2019s criminal case against Mr. Flynn interviewed at least one law enforcement official in the leak investigation after the transcripts were declassified, a move that a person familiar with the matter labeled politically fraught.\nThe biweekly updates on the leak investigations between top officials continued. Julie Edelstein, the deputy chief of counterintelligence and export control, and Matt Blue, the head of the department\u2019s counterterrorism section, briefed John C. Demers, the head of the National Security Division, and Seth DuCharme, an official in the deputy attorney general\u2019s office, on their progress. Mr. Benvenuto was involved in briefings with Mr. Barr.\nMr. Demers, Ms. Edelstein, Mr. Blue and Mr. Benvenuto are still at the Justice Department. Their continued presence and leadership roles would seem to ensure that Mr. Biden\u2019s appointees, including Attorney General Merrick B. Garland, would have a full understanding of the investigations."

        "title": "What Data About You Can the Government Get From Big Tech?",
        "fulltext": "The Justice Department, starting in the early days of the Trump administration, secretly sought data from some of the biggest tech companies aboutjournalists,Democratic lawmakersandWhite House officialsas part of wide-ranging investigations into leaks and other matters, The New York Times reported last week.\nThe revelations, which put the companies in the middle of a clash over the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to find the sources of news coverage, raised questions about what sorts of datatech companies collect on their users, and how much of it is accessible to law enforcement authorities.\nHere\u2019s a rundown:\nAll sorts. Beyond basic data like users\u2019 names, addresses and contact information, tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook also often have access to the contents of their users\u2019 emails, text messages, call logs, photos, videos, documents, contact lists and calendars.\nMost of it is. But which data law enforcement can get depends on the sort of request they make.\nPerhaps the most common and basic request is a subpoena. U.S. government agencies and prosecutors can often issue subpoenas without approval from a judge, and lawyers can issue them as part of open court cases. Subpoenas are often used to cast a wide net for basic information that can help build a case and provide evidence needed to issue more powerful requests.\nWith subpoenas, the authorities typically can get basic user data from tech companies, such as when an account was opened; the account holder\u2019s name, address, email address and billing information; and a user\u2019s internet-protocol or IP address. That can show their approximate location when the address was recorded.\nInvestigators often also seek logs of calls, text messages and emails. Such logs include details on who sent and received a call or message and when. Obtaining such data sometimes requires a higher-level request, such as a court order, which is issued by a judge.\nThe Justice Department useda court orderto seek email logs from Google for four New York Times reporters as part of its investigation into leaks of classified information several years ago. The Times successfully resisted the order after Google informed it of the request.\nIn late 2017 and early 2018, the Justice Department also requested call records, as well as other basic information, from Apple and Microsoft related to people who work in Congress.\nApple and Microsoft complied with those subpoenas in part, but the companies did not send any call records to the Justice Department, according to two people familiar with the companies\u2019 responses.\nApple said that it turned over call records only when the authorities have a warrant and that in 2019 it stopped collecting call logs.\nLaw enforcement officials are more likely to obtain call logs from telecommunications companies like Verizon and AT&T.\nA warrant is a much more powerful investigative tool and can yield all sorts of sensitive, private data about tech companies\u2019 users.\nInvestigators can get a warrant by submitting an application to a judge that lays out evidence suggesting the subject of the warrant committed a crime. The judge can then issue the warrant for specific information.\nWith a warrant, officials can get access to far more data than with a subpoena, including the contents of emails, text messages, photos, documents, calendars and contact lists.\nApple, Google and Microsoft store such data on their servers as part of their cloud services for consumers. Those cloud services are frequently used by customers to retrieve information if a phone needs to be replaced.\nFacebook also turns over similar private information to authorities with warrants, including messages, photos, videos, posts and location data, it said.\nLaw enforcement authorities can also use warrants in other ways.Police have issued warrants to Googlefor any devices that were near where a crime was committed.\nThe companies say they sometimeswork with law enforcement officials to narrow their requestsso the companies turn over only information that is relevant to a case.\nApple said that in the first half of 2020, the latest period available, it received more than 5,850 requests from U.S. authorities for data related to 18,600 accounts. It turned over basic data in 43 percent of those requests and actual content data, such as emails or photos, in 44 percent of requests.\nMicrosoft said that it received 5,500 requests from U.S. law enforcement over the same period, covering 17,700 accounts, and that it turned over basic data to 54 percent of requests and content to 15 percent of requests.\nGoogle said that it received 39,500 requests in the United States over that period, covering nearly 84,700 accounts, and that it turned over some data in 83 percent of the cases. Google did not break down the percentage of requests in which it turned over basic data versus content, but it said that 39 percent of the requests were subpoenas while half were search warrants.\nFacebook said that it received 61,500 requests in the United States over the period, covering 106,100 accounts, and that it turned over some data to 88 percent of the requests. The company said it received 38,850 warrants and complied with 89 percent of them over the period, and 10,250 subpoenas and complied with 85 percent.\nIn these cases, U.S. authorities include any federal, state or local law enforcement office.\nYes. The companies say they sometimes push back on subpoenas, court orders and warrants if they believe the officials lack appropriate legal authority or if the requests are too broad.\nIn response to requests from U.S. authorities in the first half of 2020, Apple said it challenged 4 percent of requests and Microsoft said it rejected 15 percent. Google and Facebook did not disclose how often they challenged requests.\nYes. Tech companies \u2014 and law enforcement officials \u2014 can\u2019t access data that is end-to-end encrypted. Such encryption means that only the account owner, or the sender and receiver of a message, can see the contents of the information.\nFor Apple, iMessages, which are text messages sent between two iPhones, as well as FaceTime calls are end-to-end encrypted. Still, if a user backs up their text messages to Apple\u2019s iCloud service, iMessages then become accessible to Apple and can be turned over to the authorities with a warrant.\nApple\u2019s iPhones and some Android smartphones are also encrypted, which has at times led tofights with the F.B.I.over access to criminals\u2019 devices. But law enforcement authorities across the country alsoregularly use tools that can effectively hack into phonesand extract their data."

        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nFirst there was so much shouting. And now there is action. (Maybe.)\nThe bad mood about the power of Big Tech companies has a new and perhaps surprising development: House lawmakers wrote a package ofproposed legislationthat, if it all passes \u2014a very big \u201cif\u201d\u2014 could fundamentally change Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple as we know them.\nI asked my colleagueCecilia Kangto walk us through the bills, and how we got here.\nShira: What does this legislation propose to do?\nCecilia:There aresix billsthat in different ways attempt to limit the power of big tech companies. Onebillto provide more funding to government agencies that keep a check on corporations isn\u2019t that contentious.\nTell me about the contentious ones.\nOne of the proposalsis being called the \u201cAmazon bill\u201d because it wants to limit companies that own a platform, or a hub for multiple companies to sell their goods or services, from also selling its own products on that platform. That is what Amazon does. Itmight force a breakup of Amazon.\nAnotherwould make it illegal for companies to give preference to their products. That could mean that Google couldn\u2019t show YouTube videos orGoogle shopping listingsas prominently in its search results.\nAnotherbillwould make it harder for companies to acquire start-ups. Under that law, Facebook might not have been permitted tobuy Instagram and WhatsApp.\nHow did so many lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats come to believe thatthe tech giants needed to fundamentally change?\nThere was a turning point when Russians abused Facebook, Google and Twitter totry to divide American voters around the 2016 election. Politicians, fairly or unfairly, felt animus against all tech companies.\nThat helped to cement a mostly bipartisan consensus \u2014 although not always for shared reasons \u2014 that Washington needed to be less hands-off with technology companies. And antitrust law is now perceived as a way to address a set of perceived problems with tech, including for some Republicansperceptions of biasagainst conservative voices and views.\nDid Big Tech companiesmess upandcreate too many enemiesin Washington, or was it inevitable that they would be targeted for new laws and regulation?\nBoth. From my conversations with lobbyists at big tech companies, there\u2019s some regret that the companies misjudged how much good will they had with politicians and regulators. And tech companies\u2019 Washington policy offices may not have fully articulated to their bosses on the West Coast how much lawmakers had turned against Big Tech.\nBut look, a handful of technology companies are the most valuable companies in the country and influence the economy, labor practices, how people find information and the ways we live. That exposes the companies to scrutiny.\nHow are the companies responding to these bills?\nTheircentral messageis that lawmakers risk creating far more problems than they might solve. Applesays, for example, that people will be exposed to sketchy apps if Congress requires the company to let people download iPhone apps outside its official store. Lobbyists havesaidthat Amazon might be forced to stop Prime delivery for some products.\nIs there a united front among Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple?\nNot necessarily. There are some disagreements about policy. Facebook seems open toone of the proposalsthat would make it easier for people to take their data from one app to a competitor. Google is against it, and says it exposes people to scammers.\nThere\u2019s also visceral anger. Quite a few tech companies, not just the biggest ones, resent Facebook for what they believe the company has done to tarnish the entire industry. A lobbyist told me that it\u2019s difficult for Facebook to push back against antitrust legislationafter many scandals. Apple, which isat odds with Facebookin almost every way, is effectively lobbying lawmakers on behalf of it and Facebook.\nSorry for the cynicism, but what if Big Tech just waited fordivisionsandfightingamong lawmakers to kill the legislation?\nAre you sure you haven\u2019t worked in lobbying?! That\u2019s a classic strategy and it\u2019s not an illogical bet that Congress won\u2019t get its act together. But these antitrust bills, especially the ones that make acquisitions more difficult or would force companies to pull apart their businesses, are existential threats to Big Tech. The companies have to fight them.\nA middle class retirement account, at $5 billion:ProPublicaexamineshow ultrawealthy Americans including Peter Thiel, a prominent investor in young tech companies, accumulated multi-billion-dollar, tax-free fortunes in what are supposed to be retirement accounts for those with far more modest savings.\nCan e-commerce giants help India\u2019s shopkeepers?The 20 million small stores in India known as kiranas dominate shopping in the country.

        "title": "He Warned Apple About the Risks in China. Then They Became Reality.",
        "fulltext": "Doug Guthrie spent 1994 riding a single-speed bicycle between factories in Shanghai for a dissertation on Chinese industry. Within years, he was one of America\u2019s leading experts on China\u2019s turn toward capitalism and was helping companies venture East.\nTwo decades later, in 2014, Apple hired him to help navigate perhaps its most important market. By then, he was worried about China\u2019s new direction.\nChina\u2019s new leader, Xi Jinping, was leaning on Western companies to strengthen his grip on the country. Mr. Guthrie realized that few companies were bigger targets, or more vulnerable, than Apple. It assembled nearly every Apple device in China and had made the region its No. 2 sales market.\nSo Mr. Guthrie began touring the company with a slide show and lecture to ring the alarm. Apple, he said, had no Plan B.\n\u201cI was going around to business leaders, and I\u2019m like: \u2018Do you guys understand who Xi Jinping is? Are you listening to what\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d Mr. Guthrie said in an interview. \u201cThat was my big calling card.\u201d\nHis warnings were prescient. China has taken a nationalist, authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi, and American companies likeApple,Nikeandthe National Basketball Associationare facing a dilemma. While doing business in China often remains lucrative, it also increasingly requiresuncomfortable compromises.\nThat trend raises the question of whether, instead of empowering the Chinese people, American investment in the country has empowered the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u201cIt was always difficult for Western companies to do business in China, but in many ways the challenges have shifted,\u201d said Samm Sacks, a China specialist at the New America Foundation, a nonpartisan research center, who consults for U.S. companies. \u201cThe Communist Party is firmly in control, and both Western companies and Chinese companies in the private sector have been under attack.\u201d\nMr. Guthrie\u2019s career arc and evolving view of China tell the story of Western industry\u2019s complicated dance with the country over the past three decades. Mr. Guthrie and many executives, politicians and academics had bet that Western investment in China would lead the country to liberalize. It is now clear that they miscalculated.\n\u201cWe were wrong,\u201d said Mr. Guthrie, who left Apple in 2019. \u201cThe wild card was Xi Jinping.\u201d\nIn recent years,China shut down Marriott\u2019s websiteafter it listed Tibet and Taiwan as separate countries in a customer survey. Itsuspended sign-ups to LinkedInafter the site failed to censor enough political content. And the Communist Partyurged a boycottof Western apparel companies thatcriticized forced-labor practicesin Xinjiang, a Chinese region where the government isrepressing Uyghurs, the country\u2019s Muslim ethnic minority.\nApple, more than any other company, has been vulnerable to the government\u2019s harder line. As a result, over the past several years, Apple has made compromises in China that undercut the values its executives have put at the center of its brand. To placate the authorities and keep its global business running, Apple has put its Chinese customers\u2019 data at risk and aided the Chinese government\u2019s vast censorship operation,The New York Times reported last month.\nThe companyhas saidit is following the law in China and doing everything it can to secure its customers\u2019 data. \u201cWe have never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate,\u201d an Apple spokesman said. He added that Mr. Guthrie had been a midlevel employee and hadn\u2019t set policy at Apple.\nMr. Guthrie\u2019s obsession with China began in 1989. He was a sophomore economics major studying Mandarin at the University of Chicago when Chinese soldiers killed hundreds of pro-democracy protesters occupying Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Immediately, he said, \u201cI became captured by the idea of China.\u201d\nHe paused school, borrowed money from his grandparents and spent his next year in Taiwan. An avid cyclist, he trained with the national cycling team in the mornings, and studied Mandarin and taught English in the afternoons.\nAfter completing a Ph.D. at the University of California, Berkeley, and a book about the emergence of capitalism of China \u2014 \u201cDragon in a Three-Piece Suit\u201d \u2014 he began teaching at New York University in 1997. He lectured on China\u2019s economic potential and companies sought him out for advice.\nBy then, China was transitioning from making toys and tennis shoes to cars and computers. The government often required foreign companies to share their technology with state-owned firms in exchange for access to Chinese labor and consumers. To stop that, Mr. Guthrie and others pushed for the country\u2019s inclusion in the World Trade Organization, which banned such quid pro quos. In 2001, the group admitted China.\nThat same year, Apple began manufacturing there. The operation began small, but Apple executives quickly realized the potential.\nIn 2004, Apple decided to expand in China with a factory making the iPod, which was becoming a hit product. On a trip to scope out the location for the factory, the head of Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner pointed to a small mountain and told two Apple executives present that the factory would be built there, according to one of the executives. The executives were confused; the factory needed to be up and running in about six months.\nLess than a year later, the executives returned to China. The mountain was gone and the factory was operating, the executive said. The Chinese government had moved the mountain for Apple.\nOver the next two decades, the Chinese government would spend billions of dollars to help create Apple\u2019s supply chain, paving roads, recruiting workers and building factories, power plants and employee housing. Apple now assembles nearly every iPhone, iPad and Mac in China.\nIn 2014, shortly after Mr. Guthrie left his job as dean of the George Washington University business school, Apple hired him to teach its managers and advise executives about China. He also conducted research, and his first project was the company\u2019s supply chain. Mr. Guthrie, now 52, is a professor at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University.\nWhen he started at Apple, Mr. Guthrie said, its executives knew they relied too much on China and wanted to diversify. India and Vietnam were the top candidates, but Mr. Guthrie concluded that neither was a viable replacement.\nVietnam\u2019s government was cooperative, but the country simply did not have enough workers, he said. India had the people, but its bureaucracy made it complicated to build infrastructure and factories. Beyond those issues, most of the smaller suppliers that made Apple\u2019s screws, circuit boards and other components were already concentrated in China.\nApple has still pushed into India and Vietnam in recent years, including by building a smaller iPhone assembly plant in India, but Tim Cook, the chief executive, has said publicly that its supply chain will remain centered in China.\nTo Mr. Guthrie, that stance left Apple vulnerable, especially as China\u2019s new leader was looking for ways to use his influence over American companies in the country. In 2014, China\u2019s so-called dispatch labor law went into effect, limiting the share of temporary workers in a company\u2019s work force to 10 percent. From Day 1, Apple and its suppliers were in violation.\nAt a Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou, China, the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory, temporary workers made up as much as half of the work force, according to a report by China Labor Watch, an advocacy group. After the report, Apple confirmed that the factory broke the law.\nApple executives were concerned and confused, Mr. Guthrie said. They knew the company couldn\u2019t comply because it needed the extra workers to meet periods of intense demand, such as the holidays.\n\u201c\u2018This is the point. You are supposed to be out of compliance,\u2019\u201d he said he had told them. \u201c\u2018Not so they can shut you down, but so you\u2019ll figure out what they want you to do and figure out how to do it.\u2019\u201d\nMr. Guthrie, who is often tucking his long, graying hair behind his ears, began giving his lecture on Apple\u2019s risk in China around that time. Its extreme reliance on the country left it with little leverage to resist.\nApple continued to grapple with demands from the government. Sometimes it was able to successfully resist them. At one point, the Chinese government asked for the computer code underpinning the security of iPhones, according to a former Apple executive familiar with the request.\nTo comply, Apple would have had to create a so-called back door for the Chinese authorities to bypass an iPhone\u2019s security, similar to what the Federal Bureau of Investigation had asked for in 2016 \u2014 and Apple rebuffed the request. In China, Apple also pushed back and persuaded the government that it didn\u2019t need the data, according to the executive.\nTo measure the success of their lobbying, Apple executives looked to the government\u2019s annual corporate social responsibility scores, a proxy for the Communist Party\u2019s view of a company. Apple had struggled for years in the rankings.\nAhead of the scores in 2017, Apple published a report that promoted the company\u2019s contributions to China. The report was a collaboration among several departments at Apple, and the government\u2019s praise of the report was celebrated inside the company, according to Apple documents viewed by The Times.\nApple\u2019s score steadily improved. From 2016 to 2020, its ranking among all companies in China rose from No. 141 to No. 30.\nApple didn\u2019t always successfully resist the government\u2019s demands. Over that period, Mr. Cook had agreed to store his Chinese customers\u2019 private data \u2014 and the digital keys to unlock that data \u2014 on computer servers owned and run by the Chinese government."

        "title": "Antitrust Overhaul Passes Its First Tests. Now, the Hard Parts.",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Six bills that could reshape the power of the tech industry passed an important hurdle in the House. But the outcomes of the votes, and the debates before they took place, also showed divisions among lawmakers \u2014 and underscored why final passage of the package is expected to be difficult.\nIn a marathon session of debate and voting that started Wednesday morning and continued into Thursday, the Judiciary Committee advanced the suite of bills, which are meant to weaken the dominance of Big Tech. The bills would bulk up antitrust agencies, make it harder to acquire potential rivals and prevent platforms from selling or promoting their own products to disadvantage competitors.\nDemocrats, who have had the most say over the bills and who overwhelmingly support the proposals, are focused on the market power of Amazon, Apple, Facebook andGoogle. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Democratic chairman of the committee, said the votes \u201cpave the way for a stronger economy and a stronger democracy for the American people by reining in anticompetitive abuses of the most dominant firms.\u201d\nA handful of Republicans joined Democrats in approving the proposals. Those Republicans argue that the proposals would help address one of their main concerns: the power that social media companies have over speech, and what they argue is political bias and censorship of conservative voices.\nBut many other Republicans say that the bills only add more government intervention while not directly addressing their concerns about free speech.\nThat debate within the Republican Party spilled out on Wednesday as soon as the first bill was brought up for a vote. The proposal, considered among the least contentious of the six, would increase the costs of fees associated with some mergers to help raise more funding for the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which regulate deals.\nDuring a three-hour debate about the bill, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the committee, said it was a power grab for the Democrat-led antitrust agencies, making them bigger and more influential. He also said the antitrust bills failed to address the ability ofFacebookand other social media companies to cut off political voices.\n\u201cBig tech censors conservatives,\u201d Mr. Jordan said, a claim he has made repeatedly even though data shows that many conservative personalities thrive on social media. \u201cThese bills don\u2019t fix that problem; they make it worse.\u201d\nRepresentative Ken Buck of Colorado, a fellow Republican and a co-sponsor of the bills, agreed that the tech companies silence conservatives. But he implored his party for unity to take on the power of Big Tech, saying the proposals would limit the overall power of the companies.\n\u201cThese bills are conservative,\u201d Mr. Buck said.\nWhile progressive lawmakers largely back the bills, the proposals have frustrated Democratic lawmakers from California, who say they go too far in regulating their state\u2019s most prominent companies.\nRepresentative Lou Correa, a Democrat from Southern California, said that the number of people in the state working for the big tech companies had grown substantially, helping to fund services like public education and support for people affected by Covid.\n\u201cThese firms \u2014 high tech \u2014 are the reason California has a budget surplus, as opposed to a deficit,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cWe want to make sure that we don\u2019t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.\u201d\nOther California Democrats who expressed concerns about the bills included Representative Zoe Lofgren, whose district includes part of San Jose, and Representative Eric Swalwell.\nMs. Lofgren worried during the hearing that the bills could ensnare companies that do not share the tech giants\u2019 immense scale. Mr. Swalwell said before the hearing even began that he would oppose several of the bills.\n\u201cIn my district alone, I represent thousands \u2014 likely in the five digits \u2014 of employees affected by the proposed laws,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is these people whose jobs, families and livelihoods I was elected to protect \u2014 and must advocate for today.\u201d\nThe committee\u2019s passage of the bills kicks off a much harder process. Eight Democratic lawmakers have asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has tremendous sway over when bills are taken up in the full House, to slow the process. The lawmakers repeated arguments made by companies like Apple that the bills could open up security and privacy vulnerabilities for customers.\nMs. Pelosi said at a Thursday news conference that she had told concerned tech companies to substantively participate in the process of crafting the legislation as it moved through the House, but she noted that lawmakers from both parties had grown concerned about Silicon Valley\u2019s power.\n\u201cThey can put forth what they want to put forth,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to ignore the consolidation that has happened and the concern that exists on both sides of the aisle.\u201d\nThe challenge is even stiffer in the Senate, where the bills will each require significant Republican support to reach the 60 votes needed to override the legislative filibuster. A few Republicans, including Josh Hawley of Missouri, have pressed for stiffer antitrust laws. But it is unclear whether many more will join him.\nSome bills, like the one to generate more money for regulators, could face less resistance than others. The committee approved that bill on Wednesday by a vote of 29 to 12. The sixth and final bill, a measure that could break apart elements of the tech giants\u2019 businesses, was approved on Thursday afternoon 21 to 20.\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s an uphill climb for the toughest bills,\u201d said Paul Gallant, a research analyst at Cowen and Company. \u201cThe Senate filibuster is always the highest hurdle, and I suspect it will hold back the toughest of these bills. But the House is going faster and farther against tech than anyone expected.\u201d\nThe bills face fierce opposition from technology companies, which have marshaled their considerable lobbying operations. Ahead of the votes on Wednesday, Apple sent a letter to committee leaders warning that if the bills were passed, it would not be able to offer certain privacy and security features for users. Think tanks and lobbying groups funded by tech companies issued critical statements before the votes.\nThe bills \u201csingle out a handful of America\u2019s most innovative and globally competitive tech companies for divestiture and draconian regulation,\u201d said Alec Stapp, a director of the Progressive Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank that received sponsorship from tech companies.\nChamber of Progress, a newly formed trade group representing Amazon and Google, said that a recent Morning Consult survey showed that voters didn\u2019t see tech regulation as a top priority.\n\u201cConsumers want the government to scrutinize and regulate the tech industry, but don\u2019t want Congress redesigning the apps and services that make their lives easier,\u201d said the Chamber of Progress\u2019s chief executive, Adam Kovacevich.\nAlex Harman, a competition policy advocate at Public Citizen, which has been pushing for the bills, said Wednesday\u2019s votes represented an important moment. Almost a decade ago, he said, there had been little Capitol Hill support for an investigation of Google\u2019s practices by the Federal Trade Commission, which ultimately decided not to pursue a case against the company.\n\u201cNine years later, we are in a world where a serious bipartisan effort in a committee is not just trying to push on an investigation, they\u2019re trying to break them up,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a big deal.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple once again took aim at the vast digital-advertising industry on Monday and unveiled a number of changes to protect iPhones users\u2019 privacy and strengthen its position as a gatekeeper between consumers and the rest of the digital industry.\nApple said thatnew iPhone softwarescheduled for this fall, called iOS 15, would add a so-called app privacy report that tells people what data apps are collecting about them. The report will display when an app has gained access to sensitive parts of the device, such as the photo album, contacts list or microphone. Google announced a similar feature for Android devices last month.\nApple also said its Mail app would now better protect the identities of users from people who send them emails and would block the ability of marketers to track whether a person opens an email.\nApple also showed off a new service that hides users\u2019 internet traffic from internet providers, much like the virtual private network, or V.P.N., services sold by a number of other companies.\nThe technology routes a user\u2019s internet traffic through computer servers designed to conceal the user\u2019s identity and location. Such technology has been used to get around government firewalls that censor the internet, such as in China, and it\u2019s unclear how Apple\u2019s service would work there. The service would be available to people who pay extra for Apple\u2019s iCloud data storage.\nApple\u2019s privacy push has put the company at odds with some big rivals,most notably Facebook, that rely on collecting data about people to better target ads. Despite protests from some corners of Silicon Valley, Monday\u2019s announcements show that Apple has doubled down on privacy features.\nYet the company\u2019s public branding on privacy is also undermined by its business in China, where it is putting its Chinese customers\u2019 data at risk and aiding the government\u2019s censorship operation to placate authorities there,The New York Times reported last month.\nOn Monday, Apple also announced new features designed to make the iPhone the only item someone needs to carry with them when leaving home. Apple has already allowed people to pay for items in stores and get through subway turnstiles with iPhones. Now it is trying to move government identification cards onto the devices. Apple said people could soon scan their driver\u2019s licenses to use digital versions of the IDs, which will be accepted in some participating states and airport security checkpoints in the United States.\nApple is also trying to replace physical keys. The company said it was making it easier to use digital keys to unlock doors at homes, offices and hotels. Hyatt Hotels plans to use the technology at more than 1,000 properties beginning in the fall, Apple said.\nApple is also greatly expanding FaceTime, its videoconferencing service. For more than a decade, FaceTime was an app exclusive to Apple users. But it soon will be opened to web browsers, which will also allow non-Apple devices like Android phones to participate in FaceTime calls.\nApple is adding a host of features that FaceTime callers can use together in a group session. A group on a video call will be able to listen to music or stream movies together. They can also use some apps together \u2014 like a delivery app to take turns adding food to an order before meeting up.\nThe new mobile operating system will also add a text-recognition ability to the iPhone camera, allowing a photo of handwritten text to be automatically transcribed into typed text or a photo of a billboard with a phone number to enable you to dial that phone number."

        "title": "What to Know About the Newest iPhone and Android Software",
        "fulltext": "As the pandemic recedes across the country, a lot has changed about how we work and live. Some of us are now planning on returning to the office, while others will continue working from home. Many of us will do both.\nThe software on our phones, which have been our most essential tools in the pandemic, is also evolving for this new reality. The changes are courtesy of Apple and Google, which recently unveiled their latest phone software designed for this Covid-accelerated era of hybrid remote work.\nThis week,Apple showed iOS 15, its next operating system foriPhones. The software gives device owners new tools to draw boundaries for hybrid work, like a status message that lets others know you are busy before they message you. FaceTime, Apple\u2019s videoconferencing software, will also get its biggest expansion since its debut more than a decade ago. The service will finally be opened to non-Apple devices, including Android phones, and has been improved so video sessions look and sound better.\nLast month,Google introducedAndroid 12, its latest operating system for mobile devices. The company focused on streamlining the design of its software to help people get their work done more efficiently, including a menu of shortcuts to get to their favorite tools more quickly.\nTo Carolina Milanesi, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies, the changes in iOS 15 and Android 12 \u2014 especially Apple\u2019s tool for setting digital boundaries \u2014 reflect the way our lives and work are shifting again as we try to leave the pandemic behind.\n\u201cThat little prompt that says people don\u2019t want to be disturbed is going to be really important,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll prepare your message on the weekend, but you don\u2019t hit send until Monday morning, so that way you don\u2019t push other people to work on a weekend. It takes the pressure away.\u201d\nApple and Google walked me through the highlights of their new mobile operating systems, which also include new privacy controls and enhancements to phone cameras. Both systems are set for release this fall.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nStuck at home for most of the last year, many of us became glued to our phone screens, chatting on video calls and messaging loved ones amiddoomscrolling sessions. For some, that made it feel impossible to stay focused on a single task.\nIn response, Apple\u2019s new software provides iPhone owners with tools to minimize distractions, while Google has added buttons to help people perform tasks on the phone more quickly.\nConsider one new feature from Apple, called Focus. Focus can be used to set dividing lines for different parts of your day. You can break up your day into categories like personal life, work and sleep. For each of those, you then decide which people and apps can cause notifications to appear on your phone.\nDuring work, you can set the phone so that only your boss\u2019s messages appear as notifications; other notifications will be muted. If you want to stay focused on your personal life, you could allow notifications only from family and friends. You can also set the phone to Do Not Disturb and have a status message like \u201cOn deadline\u201d or \u201cAt the movies.\u201d People trying to message you will see that status and might consider messaging you later.\nGoogle\u2019s changes are more cosmetic. It redesigned the controls in Android to include large rectangular buttons for easy access to functions such as the flashlight, internet settings and the audio recorder.\nVideoconferencing has become a ubiquitous communication medium for office meetings, happy hours and yoga sessions. Now Apple\u2019s FaceTime is getting a major revamp, with more features and the ability to work with non-Apple devices. Those changes put it more on a par withZoom, the No. 1 videoconferencing app.\nFor the first time with iOS 15, FaceTime will be accessible through an internet browser. That means Android and Windows users can use their browsers to video chat with iPhone users in a FaceTime session by clicking on a link.\nBut the most remarkable new features for FaceTime remain exclusive to Apple users. SharePlay will allow iPhone owners on a FaceTime call to use an app together. If you stream a movie and hit the SharePlay button, the other person on the call will be able to stream the movie simultaneously. If an Android user is on the FaceTime call, though, the SharePlay function won\u2019t work at all.\nFor years, Apple and Google have competed head to head in offering phone cameras that produce excellent photos. But Apple\u2019s camera software has lagged Google\u2019s software, which is powered by artificial intelligence. In iOS 15, Apple is taking steps to make its camera software smarter.\nWith a feature that Apple calls Live Text, iPhone users can soon do more with the camera\u2019s ability to function as a document scanner. If you snapped a picture of a restaurant receipt, for instance, you will be able to use Live Text to tap on the phone number in the photo to call the restaurant. Or if you point the camera at a tracking label, you can tap on the tracking number to immediately track the package \u2014 no typing required.\nApple device owners will also be able to pull up these types of images later with a keyword search. So if you took a photo of a handwritten recipe, you could open your photo album and type the name of the recipe to search for the image. At that point, you could also convert the scribbled notes from the handwritten recipe into text and transfer it to a digital notepad.\nThe technology powering this is known as optical image recognition, blended with some artificial intelligence. Android\u2019s photo app has had a similar feature, Lens, for about four years.\nApple has made waves over the last few years with tools to protect user privacy, including a button that allows iPhone owners toask apps not to trackand share their activities with third parties like marketers.\nGoogle, whose revenue relies primarily on serving digital ads, has not responded with a similar prompt for people to easily opt out of tracking. But Android 12 will give people more transparency into the data that apps are collecting and provide new controls to restrict an app\u2019s access to data.\nOne tool, which Google calls a privacy dashboard, shows a timeline of apps that have access to different parts of the phone throughout the day. It could show that a social media app tapped your camera at 1 p.m. and that a weather app used your location at 3 p.m.\nGoogle has also added some buttons like kill switches to shut off an app\u2019s access to the phone\u2019s microphone and camera. That could be useful in sensitive situations, like when you visit a doctor and want to make sure an app is not listening in on the conversation.\nApple also said this week that more privacy controls were arriving for iPhones, including a so-called app privacy report that works similarly to Google\u2019s privacy dashboard. In addition to revealing what data is being tapped by each app, the privacy report will show the domains, or web addresses, that the apps are contacting. That could give insight into what companies an app is sharing data with while you use it."

        "title": "Yellen\u2019s New Alliance Against Leprechauns",
        "fulltext": "Over the weekend, largely at the urging of Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, finance ministers from the Group of 7 \u2014 the major advanced economies \u2014agreedto set a minimum 15 percent tax rate on the profits of foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations. You may wonder what that\u2019s about, or why you should care.\nSo let me tell you about Apple and the leprechauns.\nApple Inc. has vast global reach. Its products are sold almost everywhere; it hassubsidiariesin a number of countries. It is also, of course, immensely profitable.\nBut where are those profits earned? Apple doesvery little manufacturing, mainly contracting production out to other companies, mostly in China. Much of its profitscomesfrom licensing fees, reflecting the company\u2019s intangible assets \u2014 its patents, trademarks, brands and trade secrets. And where are those intangible assets located? From an economic point of view, that\u2019s not even a meaningful question.\nFor tax purposes, however, Apple needs to report its profits somewhere. Right now that means that it\u2019s basically up to Apple to declare where it makes its money \u2014 and what it does, naturally, is claim that its profits accrue to subsidiaries in countries with low tax rates on those profits, Ireland in particular.\nIn fact, until 2014 it went even further than that: A large share of its global profits wasassignedto Apple Sales International, which was registered in Ireland but for tax purposes was located nowhere at all. In 2015, however, some combination of pressure from the European Commission and changes in Irish tax laws induced Apple to reassign many of its intangible assets to its regular Irish subsidiary.\nHow big a deal was this? On paper, Ireland\u2019s gross domestic product suddenly jumped 25 percent, even though nothing real had changed \u2014 a phenomenon I dubbed \u201cleprechaun economics,\u201d a term that has stuck. (Fortunately, the Irish have a sense of humor.)\nThe thing is, Apple is far from unique in exploiting its multinational status to avoid taxes, and Ireland is far from being the most egregious tax haven, even in Europe.\nAccording toInternational Monetary Fund numbers, Luxembourg \u2014 which has about the same population as Vermont \u2014 has attracted more than $3 trillion in foreign corporate investment, roughly comparable to the total for the U.S. as a whole. What\u2019s that about? Almost no real investment is involved; instead, the tiny duchy has offered many companiesdealsunder which they can report their profits there while paying almost nothing in taxes.\nSo what do we learn from these stories? First, that the current international tax system offers huge scope for corporate tax avoidance.\nSecond, we learn that when nations try to compete with one another by cutting corporate tax rates \u2014 the so-called race to the bottom \u2014 they aren\u2019t really fighting about who will get jobs and productivity-enhancing investments. There\u2019s very little evidence that cutting profit taxes actually induces corporations tobuild factoriesand expand employment.\nNo, they\u2019re really just fighting about where profits will be reported and hence taxed. And with tax rates falling and tax avoidance flourishing, the result is that tax revenue keeps dropping.\nBack in the 1960s, federaltaxes on corporate profitswere, on average, about 3.5 percent of G.D.P.; now they average around 1 percent. That\u2019s a revenue loss of more than $500 billion a year, enough to pay for a lot of infrastructure, child care, and more.\nWhich brings us to that G7 deal. How would the 15 percent minimum rate work? Here\u2019s how Gabriel Zucman \u2014 who has arguably done more than anyone else to highlight the importance of international tax avoidance \u2014summarizes it: \u201cTake a German multinational that books income in Ireland, taxed at an effective rate of 5 percent. Germany will now collect an extra 10 percent tax to arrive at a rate of 15 percent \u2014 same for profits booked by German multinationals in Bermuda, Singapore, etc.\u201d\nObviously this would immediately slash the amount of tax corporations could avoid by shifting reported profits to tax havens. And it would also greatly reduce the incentive for countries to serve as tax havens in the first place. Oh, and if you think corporations can avoid all this just by moving their parent companies to, say, Bermuda, major economies can make that difficult.\nTo put this in a broader context, what we\u2019re looking at here is the beginning of an attempt to fix a system that is rigged against workers in favor of capital. Workers have few ways to avoid income taxes, payroll taxes and sales taxes besides actually moving to another country. Multinational corporations, which are ultimately owned in large part by a smallwealthyminority, can shop for low-tax jurisdictions without doing anything real besides hiring some skilled accountants. The G7 plan would curb that practice.\nSo far, to be sure, all that we have is an agreement among finance ministers, with some important details still to be worked out. Turning it into legislation won\u2019t be easy: Corporations can hire lobbyists as well as accountants.\nBut this is still a big deal \u2014 an important step toward a fairer world.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.
