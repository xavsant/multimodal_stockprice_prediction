        "fulltext": "Tim Cooktook the standfor the first time as Apple\u2019s chief executive. The billionaire creator of one of the world\u2019s most popular video games walked a federal judge througha tour of the so-called metaverse. And lawyers in masks debated whetheran anthropomorphic banana without pantswas appropriate to show in federal court.\nFor the past three weeks, Apple has defended itself in a federal courtroom in Oakland, Calif., againstclaims that it abused its powerover theiPhoneApp Store, in one of the biggest antitrust trials in Silicon Valley\u2019s history. Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite,sued Apple last yearseeking to allow apps to avoidthe 30 percent commissionthat the iPhone maker takes on many app sales.\nOn Monday, the trial \u2014 which covered esoteric definitions of markets as well as oddball video game characters \u2014 concluded with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California pressing the companies on what should change in Apple\u2019s business, if anything. The decision over the case, as well as the future of the $100 billion market for iPhone apps, now rests in her hands. Judge Gonzalez Rogers has said she hopes to issue a verdict by mid-August.\nYet even inan era of antitrust scrutinyof the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, the trial showed how difficult it was to take on a $2.1 trillion corporate titan like Apple.\nTo sue Apple, Epic spared little expense. The games maker, which is based in Cary, N.C., sacrificed a valuable product when Apple yanked the Fortnite iPhone app \u2014 which had generatedmore than $1 billion in sales\u2014 from the App Store. Epic also spent millions of dollars on lawyers, economists and expert witnesses. Yet it still began the trial at a disadvantage because antitrust laws tend to favor defendants, according to legal experts who tracked the case.\nWhile Judge Gonzalez Rogers signaled openness to Epic\u2019s arguments during the trial, a ruling in favor of the video game maker might not lead to momentous changes in the market for mobile apps. Any verdict is also likely to be tied up in appeals for years, at which point rapid change in the technology industry could leave its effects obsolete.\n\u201cTo mount a credible antitrust campaign, you need to have a significant war chest,\u201d said David Kesselman, an antitrust lawyer in Los Angeles who has followed the case. \u201cAnd the problem for many smaller companies and smaller businesses is that they don\u2019t have the wherewithal to mount that type of a fight.\u201d\nThe case focused on how Apple wields control over the iPhone App Store tocharge its commission on app sales. Companies big and small have argued that the fee shows Apple is abusing its dominance, while Apple has responded that its cut of sales helps fund efforts to keep iPhones safe. Regulators and lawmakers have homed in on the issue, making it the center of antitrust complaints against the company.\nEpic\u2019s lawsuit was the biggest test yet of those claims \u2014 and the best shot for app developers who want to weaken Apple\u2019s grip on the iPhone app market.Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s chief executive and a longtime antagonist to big tech companies, has said he is \u201cfighting for open platforms and policy changes equally benefiting all developers.\u201d\nThroughout the trial, lawyers, investors and journalists parsed Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s comments and questions for hints of her thinking. When Epic brought its witnesses to the stand, she appeared at points to be sympathetic to Apple\u2019s arguments. But the angle of her questions shifted when Apple presented its witnesses, including Mr. Cook, last week.\nIn a sharp back-and-forth with the Apple C.E.O. on Friday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers told Mr. Cook that it was clear his company had made changes to its App Store fees in response to public pressure. She then interrogated him on why Apple was unwilling to give iPhone users more choice on where they could buy apps. In response, Mr. Cook effectively admitted that Apple wanted to maximize its profits.\nOn Monday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s comments suggested that she believed Apple deserved to profit from its innovations. But she also questioned some of the ways it sought to do so.\n\u201cThe30 percent numberhas been there since the inception. And if there was real competition, that number would move. And it hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said of Apple\u2019s commission on app sales. She also said that it was anticompetitive for Apple to ban companies from telling customers that they could buy items outside iPhone apps.\nAt other times on Monday, she appeared reluctant to force Apple to change its business. \u201cCourts do not run businesses,\u201d she said.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers also suggested that Epic\u2019s requested outcome in the case would require a significant change in Apple\u2019s business and questioned whether there was legal precedent for that. \u201cGive me some example that survived appellate review where the court has engaged in such a way to limit or fundamentally change the economic model of a monopolistic company?\u201d she asked Epic\u2019s lawyers.\nThe judge has said she expects her ruling to be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. If it is, a three-judge panel in that court could review her decision. Apple or Epic could then try to appeal that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nIf Judge Gonzalez Rogers sides with Epic, Apple will most likely seek to keep her ruling from taking effect until the appeals court weighs in, and she would probably be open to that request, said Mr. Kesselman, the antitrust lawyer. Courts are generally hesitant to force changes to businesses that could then be overturned on appeal, he said, so any changes to the App Store could take years to arrive.\nA victory for Epic would still be a boost for the wider antitrust fight against Apple. The Justice Department is investigating Apple\u2019s control over its App Store, and some federal lawmakers have said app stores are a monopoly andripe for a legislative fix. Apple also faces two other federal lawsuits over its app fees \u2014 one from consumers and one from developers \u2014 which are both seeking class-action status. Judge Gonzalez Rogers is also set to hear those cases.\nSimilarly, a victory for Apple could deflate those challenges. Regulators might be wary of pursuing a case against Apple that has already been rejected by a federal judge.\nJudge Gonzalez Rogers may also deliver a ruling that makes neither company happy. While Epic wants to be able to host its own app store on iPhones, and Apple wants to continue to operate as it has for years, she might order smaller changes.\nFormer President Barack Obama nominated Judge Gonzalez Rogers, 56, to the federal court in 2011. Given her base in Oakland, her cases have often related to the technology industry, and she has overseen at least two past cases involving Apple. In both cases, Apple won.\nShe concluded the trial on Monday by thanking the lawyers and court staff, who mostly used masks and face shields during the proceedings. Months ago in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic, it was unclear if the trial could be held in person, but Judge Gonzalez Rogers decided that it was an important enough case and ordered special rules to minimize the health risks, including limits on the number of people in court.\nEpic opted to include its chief executive over an extra lawyer, and Mr. Sweeney spent the trial inside the courtroom, watching from his lawyers\u2019 table. Mr. Sweeney, who is typically prolific on Twitter, didn\u2019t comment publicly over the last three weeks. On Monday, he broke his silence by thanking the Popeyes fried-chicken restaurant next to the courthouse."

        "title": "Faith-Based Investing Makes Up Ground in Gains and Convenience",
        "fulltext": "The intersection of faith and money can be complicated.\nBut investing by the tenets of your faith has become easier, and in many cases it\u2019s neither less profitable nor more risky than investing without a religious screen. There are Islamic exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts, Jewish venture capital funds and Catholic separately managed accounts.\nAnd these strategies are not just attracting investors of the same faith. In some cases, people are choosing to participate in what they see as a solid investing strategy regardless of its religious tenets.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is faith-based investing, like sustainable investing over all, is much easier to do now than it has been in the past,\u201d said Jackie VanderBrug, head of sustainable and impact investing in the chief investment office at Bank of America. \u201cIn the past, clients would have been told that faith-based investing is a great way to lose money. We can say now that you don\u2019t have to give up risk-adjusted returns to invest this way.\u201d\nMs. VanderBrug added that the pandemic and the social unrest that began last summer with George Floyd\u2019s killing had prompted more people to look to their faith and to invest in a way that expressed their values.\n\u201cThe pandemic brought to light our collective interdependence and vulnerability,\u201d she said. \u201cWe now have this lived experience of our interdependence.\u201d\nAs with investing with environmental, social and governance criteria, faith-based investing allows people to adhere to the tenets of their faith while still having a diversified portfolio, albeit with some exceptions.\nIn some ways, investing along faith-based lines isn\u2019t that much different from one religion to another. But some provide more guidance than others. People who invest in line with their Jewish faith often embrace the principle of tikkun olam, which calls for people to leave the world a better place. For Catholics, the United States Council of Catholic Bishopshas issuedsix principlesas guidance \u2014 including protecting human life, pursuing economic justice and protecting the environment \u2014 though interpreting those principles is up to individual investors.\nIslam has a governing body known as the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions that sets guidelines on how to invest in an Islamic-compliant way. For instance, investors are allowed to back a company only if it derives no more than 5 percent of its revenue from something that is prohibited like the sale of alcohol.\nMonem Salam, executive vice president and portfolio manager at Saturna Capital, which invests along Islamic principles, said he had two main criteria for making investments for Saturna\u2019s four funds \u2014 three in stocks and one in fixed income. The Islamic faith prohibits earning interest, but the organization has created a way for companies to borrow money to expand their operations.\nOne is to avoid any investment prohibited by Islam, which includes banks, insurance, tobacco, alcohol and pornography. But Mr. Salam said he also looked at the companies themselves. So he can invest in Islamic banks, for instance, or in beverage makers like Monster, which may have been excluded under a broad screen.\nHe said he also looked for companies that did not have excessive debt, because debt is acceptable only in cases of necessity. He steers away from companies that are cash rich, because there is a prohibition on trading in them when more than 45 percent of their balance sheet is in cash. While a portfolio with Apple holds lots of cash, it is not enough to violate the prohibition, but it is a number the fund monitors.\nHe also screens companies that have a small portion of their earnings inforbidden revenue, like an airline that sells alcohol. In that case, the fund will look to see if the company gets less than 5 percent of its revenue from something that is prohibited.\n\u201cIn an ideal world, we\u2019d be buying something that is 100 percent compliant, but that\u2019s just not possible,\u201d Mr. Salam said.\nTo add diversification, Saturna has recently added the Islamic equivalent of a fixed-income fund, which invests in the market for sukuk, which are bondlike instruments. Instead of earning interest on the bonds, investors receive a lease payment from the sukuk. For example, if an airline like Emirates needs a new plane, it can borrow the money from the sukuk market and the obligation is structured as a lease of that plane to the sukuk.\nSaturna\u2019s oldest fund, the Amana Income Fund, has afive-year return of 13 percent, compared with more than 17 percent for the S&P 500. But the Amana Growth Fund has afive-year return of 21 percent. The sukuk fund has just hit its five-year benchmark,returning just over 3 percent.\n\u201cThe difference between Islamic and non-Islamic investors is not in what they\u2019re looking for but in what products are available to them,\u201d Mr. Salam said.\nFaraz Ahmed, head of the online help platform at Google, has worked in technology for most of his career. For years, his portfolio was almost entirely focused on stocks to avoid the Islamic prohibition against interest. These investments were considered halal, or permitted, but he said he worried that his portfolio was too risky.\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been in the tech industry since the early part of my career, stock has always been a big portion of my compensation package,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cGenerally, tech companies are qualified as halal investments. But being in the tech industry and because our compensation is so tied to the stock market, it certainly heightened my awareness of creating wealth and managing your wealth.\u201d\nHe said he was looking to invest in sukuk, given the long run that equities have had. He said his goal was to balance his faith with investment returns.\n\u201cMaybe these funds won\u2019t always do as well, but I\u2019ve been very happy with the returns,\u201d Mr. Ahmed said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very satisfying to adhere to my principles and feel like I\u2019m not losing out. But being part of the Western finance system and being paid in dollars, you can\u2019t live without some exposure to things that are objectionable.\u201d\nFor investors with less wealth or a greater sensitivity to fees, several exchange-traded funds adhere to Islamic investment principles. Naushad Virji, chief executive of SP Funds and chairman of Sharia Portfolios, said the firm\u2019s U.S. fund tracked the S&P 500 but did so with only about 200 stocks.\n\u201cThe difference when it comes to Shariah compliance is the focus on avoiding companies with debt,\u201d he said. \u201cDebt is the big difference between Shariah compliance and other faith-based initiatives. Everyone says they\u2019re avoiding pornography and gambling, but debt is the difference.\u201d\nThe firm has a sukuk E.T.F. and a real estate ETF, which was a challenge because real estate is usually tied to mortgages with interest payments. Mr. Virji said he had been able to find a mix of properties where the underlying loans were backed by rental income.\nFor Catholic investors, the six principles laid out by the conference of bishops requires more interpretation. There\u2019s agreement on protecting the environment and promoting corporate responsibility, but there\u2019s less consensus on investing in the so-called sin industries.\n\u201cWe work with Catholic schools, hospitals and religious orders who are stricter about screening for gambling, tobacco and alcohol, even though the bishops don\u2019t say anything about it,\u201d said Jim Ryan, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, where he manages portfolios for Catholic institutions and individuals.\n\u201cIndividuals are concerned they\u2019re going to come across as too sanctimonious, or they want to do it and not even tell anyone,\u201d he added. \u201cThey say: \u2018I drink wine. I drink beer. Who am I kidding?\u2019\u201d\nIn both cases, Mr. Ryan said, he recommends that clients invest through separately managed accounts so they can follow their individual preferences.\n\u201cThey should know that they can change their approach at any time, but they also can\u2019t just throw money in mutual funds and forget about it,\u201d he said.\nMichael Wagner, a co-founder of Omnia Family Wealth, a wealth management firm, has volunteered with Jewish nonprofit organizations in the Miami area, where he lives. That experience, he said, prompted him to seek out investments for his clients that adhere to Jewish values of making the world better.\nOne is a new fund called J-Impact, which was created by J-Ventures, a technology venture capital fund that labels its approach a \u201ccapitalist kibbutz,\u201d for the Hebrew word for a communal settlement. What\u2019s different, Mr. Wagner said, is the communal style of decision making, which gives limited partners more of a voice in the investment decisions than usual.\n\u201cBeing involved with the Jewish Federation has brought me great personal joy and satisfaction,\u201d Mr. Wagner said. \u201cI\u2019m bringing that part of my personal life into portfolio management and feeling that we\u2019re doing good in the world. Is it a uniquely Jewish view? I\u2019m not sure it is. It\u2019s a uniquely human thing.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Cosmetics. Digital dances called \u201cemotes\u201d A currency called V-Bucks. Virtual concerts. Fortnite, the popular gaming platform, is more than just a game. It is a \u201cmetaverse,\u201d full of virtual life, said Tim Sweeney, chief executive ofEpic Games, the company that createdFortnite.\nAndApple, he argued in federal court on Monday,wants an unfair cutof the money to be made in the Fortnite metaverse.\nMr. Sweeney offered a granular explanation of Fortnite to paint an expansive portrait of his company\u2019s world on the first day of what is expected to be a three-week trial, pittingEpic against Applein a fight over Apple\u2019s App Store fees and other rules that could reshape the $100 billion app economy.\nEpicsued Apple in August, arguing that Apple is unfairly leaning on its control of the App Store to extract an unfair cut of the money Epic makes from selling digital goods inside Fortnite.\nEpic, valued at $29 billion and based in Cary, N.C., is not seeking monetary damages. The company wants Apple to allow apps like Fortnite to circumvent Apple\u2019s payment systems and even offer their own app store within Apple\u2019s.\nThe outcome of the trial will have wide-reaching implications for the broader antitrust push against big tech companies. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, which owns Google, face variousantitrust claims by state and federal governmentsin the United States and Europe. Apple is alsobattling two potential class-action lawsuitsfrom consumers and developers over its App Store fees.\nFortnite, Mr. Sweeney said, \u201cis a phenomenon that transcends gaming,\u201d he said. \u201cOur aim of Fortnite is to build something like a metaverse from science fiction.\u201d\nMetaverse? A court reporter needed clarification. It\u2019s a virtual world for socializing and entertainment, Mr. Sweeney said.\nThe legal arguments in the case center on the boundaries of the market the two companies are fighting over. Apple\u2019s lawyers focused their opening statements on gaming, arguing that people can get access to Fortnite in many places other than the App Store, like gaming consoles.\nEpic argues that the case is about the broader app economy and that Apple has a monopoly with its App Store for iPhone users. In particular, Epic is fighting a 30 percent commission that Apple takes on purchases made inside iPhone apps like Fortnite.\nIn a mostly empty courtroom in Oakland, Katherine Forrest of the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore opened Epic\u2019s case by previewing a series of emails between Apple\u2019s top executives. The emails were evidence, Ms. Forrest argued, that the tech giant purposely created a \u201cwalled garden\u201d that locks consumers and developers inside. That forces them to use Apple\u2019s payment system, she said.\nOnce Apple lured users and developers into its walled garden, \u201cthe garden gate was closed, the lock turned,\u201d Ms. Forrest said. She compared Apple\u2019s fees on in-app purchases for subscription services to a car dealership that takes a commission on gas sales.\nApple\u2019s lawyers described, in their opening statement, a thriving market for app distribution that includes gaming consoles, desktop computer gaming and the mobile web. Karen Dunn of Paul, Weiss argued that the 30 percent commission was in line with industry standards and that Epic\u2019s requests, if granted, would make iPhones less secure, while unlawfully forcing Apple to do business with a competitor.\nMs. Dunn added that Epic\u2019s case was a self-serving way to avoid paying fees it owed Apple and was on shaky legal footing. \u201cTo win this case, Epic will have to convince this court of so many things that don\u2019t make any sense,\u201d she concluded.\nThe first day of the court fight over high-tech competition included in-the-weeds terms like hotfix, sideloading and multiplatform middleware services. But the day began with a familiar experience in the pandemic: Zoom difficulties. The trial\u2019s start was delayed by around 40 minutes because of technical issues with the hotlines set up for remote listening.\nIn another sign of the pandemic\u2019s changes to trials, everyone allowed into the mostly empty room wore a mask or face shield. The judge\u2019s bench was surrounded by plexiglass dividers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an adventure \u2014 not even the year, but this case,\u201d said Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers, who will decide the case.\nApp developers have privately grumbled over the years about Apple\u2019s tight grip on its App Store and the secretive ways it enforces its rules. But few have dared to speak publicly about it, much less mount a legal challenge. Alongside its lawsuit, Epic created a nonprofit coalition to make the case for \u201cfairness\u201d from app platforms like Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s, Apple\u2019s lawyers testified on Monday; several dozen smaller companies have joined.\nMr. Sweeney has been vocal about his distaste for the app stores\u2019 control over access to apps and its impact on his metaverse vision. Apple\u2019s level of control, he said inan interview last year, is \u201ccompletely unprecedented in human history.\u201d\nBut Mr. Sweeney was so soft-spoken in his testimony on Monday, a court reporter had to repeatedly ask for clarification on gaming and technology terms. He wore a suit, ditching his usual, T-shirt and cargo shorts. He also wore a clear face shield.\nIn his testimony, Mr. Sweeney explained Epic\u2019s decision to pursue the lawsuit. \u201cI wanted to show the world through actions exactly what the ramifications of Apple\u2019s policy were,\u201d he said.\nIn a cross-examination, Richard Doren of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher hammered at Mr. Sweeney with a rapid series of yes-or-no questions to make the point that Epic also publishes Fortnite on other platforms, like gaming consoles \u2014 and that Epic is not complaining about them.\nBut Mr. Sweeney countered that the gaming consoles, which typically lose money on the hardware they sell and make it up on fees, have different business models from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s app stores, which are highly profitable.\nMr. Doren asked Mr. Sweeney if he knew that the actions Epic took last summer would cause Apple to kick his company\u2019s app out of the App Store. He suggested that Mr. Sweeney had hoped Apple would cave in to the pressure because of Fortnite\u2019s popularity.\n\u201cI hoped Apple would seriously reconsider its policy then and there,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. Apple did not, and Epic sued.\nIn the coming weeks, top Apple executives, including the chief executive, Tim Cook, and executives from Microsoft and Match Group are expected to testify."

        "title": "Apple and Epic Head to Court Over Their Slices of the App Pie",
        "fulltext": "One Friday last August, Tim Sweeney,a billionaire game developer, sent an email to a contact at Microsoft: \u201cYou\u2019ll enjoy the upcoming fireworks show.\u201d\nA week later, Mr. Sweeney\u2019s gameFortnitedelivered good news to players on iPhones: They would get a discount on items in the game if they completed the purchases outsideApple\u2019spayment systems.\nThe change violatedApple\u2019s rules and cut the iPhone maker off fromcollecting a commissionon one of the world\u2019s most popular games. Hours later,Applekicked Fortnite off the App Store.\nMr. Sweeney\u2019s company,Epic Games,immediately sued Applein federal court. It also began a public-relations broadside that was months in the works, complete with a trending #FreeFortnite hashtag and a parody of Apple\u2019s iconic \u201c1984\u201d ad depictingApple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, as an evil corporate overlord with an apple for a head.\nEpic\u2019s attack was the most direct challenge toApple\u2019s power in years, and nine months later, the fight is heading to federal court in Oakland, Calif. On Monday, a trial is scheduled to open with testimony from Mr. Sweeney on why he believes Apple is a monopoly abusing its power.\nThe trial, which is expected to last about three weeks, carries major implications. If Epic wins, it will upend the economics of the $100 billion app market and create a path for millions of companies and developers to avoid sendingup to 30 percent of their app salesto Apple.\nAn Epic victory would also invigorate the antitrust fight against Apple. Federal and state regulators are scrutinizing Apple\u2019s control over the App Store, and on Friday,the European Union charged Applewith violating antitrust laws over its app rules and fees. Apple faces two other federal lawsuits about its App Store fees \u2014 one from developers and one from iPhone owners \u2014 that are seeking class-action status.\nBeating Apple would also bode well for Epic\u2019s upcoming trial against Google over the same issues on the app store for Android devices. That case is expected to go to trial this year and would be decided bythe same federal judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California.\nIf Apple wins, however, it will strengthen its grip over mobile apps and stifle its growing chorus of critics, further empowering a company that is already the world\u2019s most valuable and topped $200 billion in sales over just the past six months.\nThe trial will center on a legal debate over whether Apple is a monopoly. Epic\u2019s lawyers have argued that companies need iPhones to reach customers and that Apple unfairly forces app makers to use its payment system and pay its fees.\nApple\u2019s lawyers have responded that iPhones are merely one way to reach consumers and that Apple\u2019s fees are in line with industry standards.\nApple probably has the upper hand, legal experts said. Courts are often more sympathetic to defendants in antitrust trials, since companies have a right to choose with whom they do business.\nBut Epic is arguing that Apple is using its position of power to stifle competition, a legal theory \u201cthat has worked and overcome that disadvantage,\u201d said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University. The Department of Justice made a similar argument against Microsoft in its antitrust suit two decades ago.\nThe case might come down to one narrow technical question: What is the market these two are fighting over? Epic argues that the case is about iPhones and that Apple has a clear monopoly on them. Apple lawyers insist that the market in question includes all gaming platforms \u2014 from smartphones to video-game consoles to desktop computers \u2014 and that Apple hardly has a monopoly there.\nThe answer will be up to Judge Gonzalez Rogers. And after she decides this case, she is set to hear the next two App Store lawsuits seeking class-action status.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that Apple\u2019s top executives would show how the App Store had been good for the world. \u201cWe feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues,\u201d she said.\nEpic declined to comment.\nFortnite, a battle royale video game, is the biggest hit of Epic\u2019s 30 years in business. It got there, in part, because Mr. Sweeney pushed the companies behind the big gaming consoles \u2014 Microsoft, Sony Group and Nintendo \u2014 to let players battle each other across different devices, meaning a Microsoft Xbox owner could play a Sony PlayStation owner for the first time.\nIn 2018, Epic released Fortnite in an iPhone app. In about two years, Epic earned roughly $1 billion from Fortnite and its other iPhone apps. But it had to pay about 30 percent of that to Apple. Epic was paying similar commissions to the gaming-console makers.\nMr. Sweeney has said in interviews and on Twitter that he realized the app store commissions meant that Apple and Google could sometimes profit more on a game than the developers who had made it. He saw an opportunity to challenge the tech giants.\nMr. Sweeneyhas also saidhe was OK paying commissions to companies like Microsoft and Nintendo because they sold their gaming consoles at or below cost and depend on the commissions, while Apple earns wide margins on all parts of its business.\nOther app makers were also starting to complain about the app stores, but Epic was one of the few with the money, willingness and independence to take on a fight in court. While the Chinese internet giant Tencent bought a large chunk of Epic in 2012, Mr. Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder. Investors recently valued Epic at $29 billion.\nBut Epic is still tiny compared with Apple. In its latest quarter, Apple averaged about $30 billion in revenue a month.\n\u201cIf we let Apple and Google get away with this, in a few years they\u2019re going to extend that monopoly to exercise a degree of power over people and companies which is completely unprecedented in human history,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said in an interview last year.\nIn 2019, Mr. Sweeney decided to confront Apple. Epic hired the law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore, tapped a public relations consultant, assigned 100 to 200 employees to the project, andcreated an alliance with other app makers\u201cto ensure we\u2019re not the only voice,\u201d according to an Apple court filing. Epic named the effort Project Liberty.\nLast June, Mr. Sweeney emailed Mr. Cook and a few of his deputies, asking to release a competing marketplace for games on the iPhone and to use Epic\u2019s own payment system instead of Apple\u2019s, enabling it to circumvent Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut.\nApple\u2019s lawyers responded, writing that the company wouldn\u2019t turn the App Store \u201cinto a public utility.\u201d\nMr. Sweeney dropped the civility in his response. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad state of affairs that Apple\u2019s senior executives would hand Epic\u2019s sincere request off to Apple\u2019s legal team to respond with such a self-righteous and self-serving screed,\u201d he wrote to Mr. Cook. \u201cWe will continue to pursue this, as we have done in the past to address other injustices in our industry.\u201d\nThree weeks later, Mr. Sweeney sent his forecast for fireworks, according to an Apple court filing.\nSince then, lawyers for Epic and Apple have been telling different stories in court filings and to reporters.\nApple has said it developed a world-changing product in the iPhone that led to an \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d in mobile apps. Apple has spent billions of dollars developing the iPhone and another $100 million on its App Store, the company said, and charging a commission on app sales is partly how it recoups that investment and keeps apps safe.\nEpic has countered that Apple\u2019s commissions do very little for security. Epic is expected to call witnesses from other companies to testify on their experiences with the App Store, including an executive at Match Group, which makes the dating app Tinder. An executive at Facebook, which is locked inits own feud with Apple, had been scheduled to testify but dropped out.\nApple has accused Epic of looking for a free ride. The game maker has not gone after other companies that distribute Fortnite. Microsoft, Samsung, Sony and Nintendo all charge the same commissions on games, according toa study funded by Apple. That study did not note thatApple popularized the 30 percent ratewith the App Store in 2008.\nIn response, Epic has pointed to the commission it charges in its own marketplace for game developers: 12 percent.\nAfter Epic sued, Applehalved its commissionto 15 percent for developers that make less than $1 million on their apps. That new rate applies to about 98 percent of the developers that paid Apple\u2019s commission, according to estimates from Sensor Tower, an app data firm.\nYet it hardly affected Apple\u2019s bottom line. According to Sensor Tower, more than 95 percent of Apple\u2019s app revenues come from companies paying the full 30 percent rate."

        "title": "The Apple and Amazon Side Hustles",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of theOn Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nBothAppleandAmazoncollect cash from companies that want to pitch their products to us. Let me make the case that these side hustles are icky conflicts of interest that hurt us \u2014 and ultimately these tech titans, too.\nHere\u2019s what I mean: Try typing \u201cdog beds\u201d into the search box on Amazon. You might assume that Amazon will show you what it considers to be the very best dog beds. But actually the first options you\u2019ll see are most likely from companies that paid Amazon to appear directly in front of your eyeballs. They\u2019re advertisements in semi-disguise. Amazon tags these listings as \u201csponsored,\u201d and once you start to notice them you realize that these advertised products areeverywhere.\nApple does this, too. Try searching for \u201cfitness\u201d in the iPhone app store. The first option might be a workout app that appears in a shaded blue box. Again, it\u2019s an ad. (Android app stores tend to do this, too.)\nAmazon and Apple preach their obsession with doing the best things for customers, but these advertising businesses aren\u2019t really about us at all.\nAdvertising is not unusual or necessarily bad. The New York Times and many other reputable companies make money from ads. But I\u2019d argue that what Apple and Amazon are doing is different from almost all other advertising.\nGoogle, Facebook and The Times don\u2019t usually show you adsandsell you the advertised product. The dog bed company pays Amazon to make sure that its products are listed prominently so that people will buy them from Amazon.\nIn the companies\u2019 defense, there are some other advertising businesses that are also closed loops. Kellogg\u2019s might pay the supermarket to make sure that its cereal boxes are at eye level on the store shelf. That\u2019s similar to what Apple and Amazon do. (Though the supermarket is not valued at more than $1.5 trillion, as both Apple and Amazon are.)\nWhen companies pay Amazon and Apple to get noticed, that likely trickles down in the form of higher product or app prices for us. You might say that all advertising is annoying and a tax on consumers. But on Apple and Amazon, we\u2019re there to pay for an app or product anyway. The ads are simply a toll for choosing one dog bed or fitness app over another.\nWhen Amazon takes money from a dog bed company in exchange for making it the first item we see, that\u2019s not necessarily the best dog bed. It may not even be a good dog bed. Showing that ad is definitely good for Amazon and often for the merchant as well. But it\u2019s much harder to make the case that it\u2019s good for us. Ditto for Apple and its app advertisements.\nAmazon knows this. My colleague Karen Weisehas reported on the fierce debateinside Amazon about whether paid product commercials would erode customers\u2019 trust. Jeff Bezos made the final call that showing ads might make things a little worse for Amazon shoppers but that the extra money would help the company invent amazing new things for customers.\nBezos\u2019 assessment of short-term pain for long-term gain might be right. Or maybe he just got excited about the money.\nApple has argued that online advertising that tracks its users is an invasion of our privacy anddeclared a war with Facebook over ads. The company also wants to go bigger in selling advertising. (Apple says that its ads are less invasive than those of other companies.)\nLet me propose an alternative for Amazon and Apple. Instead of grabbing for more cash with paid commercials, what if the companies improved their products and made more money that way?\nIt\u2019s been a big problem for years that Apple\u2019s app store is a sea of options and that makes it hard for people to discover something new that might interest them. Paid app promotions that don\u2019t surface the best apps are not the right answer. At Amazon, it sometimes feels as if the company doesn\u2019t know how to make a nice place for people to shop easily. Ads are not the answer. They may be making things worse.\nI recently went looking for a pulse oximeter on Amazon and searched for a specific brand. I was overwhelmed and turned off by how many ads I saw for what seemed to be shady knockoffs. I gave up. Amazon lost a potential sale because its store can feel like an unruly mess, and its paid commercials are part of the problem.\nMaybe there should be a Golden Rule for rich and powerful tech titans: Just because a company can make money doing something, doesn\u2019t mean that it should.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nA cryptocurrency craze is becoming fuel for on-court trash talk:A new type of virtual trading cards featuring basketball highlights has engrossed some of the athletes, too.

        "title": "The Apple Tax Is Rotten",
        "fulltext": "Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is unflappability personified. When facing tough questions from investors, journalists or lawmakers, Cook tends to speak with the sparkling precision of an iPhone\u2019sdiamond-cut edges\u2014 slowly, commandingly, in an elegant Southern drawl that conveys exactly the sort of finality you\u2019d expect from the head of a $2 trillion tech titan.\nLast week, though, Cook might have felt a bit like aspinningpinwheel under the polite yet relentless interrogation of a Federal District Court judge charged with deciding whether Apple is a ruthless monopolist. In theprocess, the judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, Calif., highlighted a scourge affecting just about every Apple customer and the software developers who want to build apps for them.\nCall this scourge what it plainly is, the Apple tax \u2014 the billions of dollars a year that Apple collects from large swaths of the technology industry for the privilege of offering paid apps and in-app purchases to iPhone and iPad users. Once, in theearly daysof the iPhone, Apple\u2019s 30 percent fee on app purchases, and its restrictive rules, could be defended on the grounds of its great innovation in the mobile market. Apple, after all, was the first to market the modern touch-screen smartphone and the simple, one-tap way of adding apps to it, and it seemed reasonable for the company to collect tremendous winnings from its creation.\nBut for how many years should Apple get to milk billions of dollars of almost pure profit from an invention first released back when George W. Bush was president? What justification is there any longer for Apple\u2019s severe restrictions on how users and software makers can do business with each other, other than that it has the market power to impose them? Isn\u2019t it time we were all given a break from the Apple tax?\nApple\u2019s tax is a great boon to its bottom line. It is a costly drag for the users who spend enormous sums on its products and for developers looking to create apps to add tricks to your iPhone. And it can no longer be defended with a straight face.\nThe present federal case came aboutlast summer, when Epic Games, which makes the blockbuster video gameFortnite, sued Apple over the strict control the company maintains over software on iPhones and iPads. Unlike personal computers, which let users download software from anywhere online, Apple\u2019s mobile devices allow only a single source for apps: Apple\u2019s built-in App Store. (Google\u2019s app store on its Android phones hassimilar rulesandfees; Epic has filed a separate suit over those.)\nApple says its restrictions are crucial to the iPhone\u2019s safe, hassle-free appeal. Apple vets all the apps in its store for security, privacy and suitability; for instance, the company prohibits apps containing pornography.\nThe catch is that in exchange for access to iPhone users, the company exacts a heavy toll from many software developers. Almost any time you pay an app maker through Apple\u2019s devices, the company takes a big cut of the transaction. Thus if you play Fortnite on your iPhone and decide to outfit your avatar with a $15digital hamburger suit, Apple will happily bank $4.50 to send you pixels of beef, leaving $10.50 for Epic. There is an even more pernicious rule:Developers are not allowed to mentionanywhere in their apps that users can pay through some other, often cheaper, non-Apple payment service.\nEpic, one ofthe biggest companiesin the video game industry,saysthat in requiring developers to sell through its App Store and use its payment system, Apple \u201cimposes unreasonable and unlawful restraints to completely monopolize\u201d the market for mobile apps and digital payments within apps.\nAlthough the trialcame to a conclusionon Monday, its true climax was late last week, when Gonzalez Rogers \u2014 who is not expected to render her verdict for months, peppered Cook with a series of pointed queries about Apple\u2019s golden-goose business model.\nApple has long maintained that it wants to empower users with control over their digital lives. So if it cares so deeply about users\u2019 agency,the judge asked Cook, why not allow people to have a choice in how they pay for digital goods?\nThe question seemed to catch the C.E.O. off guard, and he answered with unusual frankness. If Apple allowed app developers to link to alternative payment methods, he said, \u201cwe would in essence give up our total return on our\u201d intellectual property. Apple spends a lot of money building and maintaining the App Store, Cook said, and it\u2019s also giving app developers access to a lot of customers. That\u2019s worth the 30 percent cut, he suggested.\nThe judge kept pushing. Even if Apple brings iPhone users to Epic\u2019s yard, after that first interaction, isn\u2019t Apple effectively just collecting an ongoing profit by virtue of its position as a middleman?\nHere\u2019s where things get tricky. Apple argues that it isn\u2019t really a restrictive monopolist because Fortnite can be downloaded on lots of different systems \u2014 Android phones, video game consoles and personal computers. Some of those platforms also charge developers a cut of purchases. For instance, gaming systems like Microsoft\u2019s Xbox and Sony\u2019s PlayStation take a 30 percent cut on purchases of digital games, though unlike Apple, theytend to sell their hardware at a loss.Apple makes a hefty profit on its hardwareand in recent years has even raised its prices. In some ways, the problem with Apple\u2019s App Store rules isn\u2019t that they\u2019re uniquely onerous; it\u2019s that the store is so huge, its harms are more widespread. The App Store\u2019s revenue in 2020was $72 billion, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm, nearly twice that of Google\u2019s app store.\nGonzalez Rogers also pointed out the various ways Apple seems inured to competition. It has maintained the 30 percent fee almost unchanged since the App Store\u2019s launch in 2008. Only late last year did it offer aprice break for small-time developers. But \u201cthat really wasn\u2019t the result of competition,\u201d the judgesaid. \u201cThat seemed to be a result of the pressure that you\u2019re feeling from investigations, from lawsuits \u2014 not competition.\u201d\nOther evidence in the case underlined the thesis that Apple acts with impunity in the app market, as if it has little to fear from competitors. In 2018, when Netflix was considering disallowing users to subscribe to its service from their iPhones, one Apple manager floated imposing\u201cpunitive measures\u201don Netflix for its temerity in looking to escape the Apple tax. (Netflix and other streaming services did eventually prevent users from subscribing through their iPhone apps.)\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Epic case that ought to worry iPhone users. Rivals have accused Appleof imposing technical roadblocksthat give its apps a leg up on competitors. European regulators have said Apple favors its music appover rivals like Spotify. Tile, a company that creates beacons that let you find your misplaced possessions, worries that Apple has given its own new finder device, AirTags, a technical advantage in working with iPhones. \u201cWe think it is entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple\u2019s business practices,\u201d CJ Prober, Tile\u2019s chief executive,told The Times in April.\nI agree. Apple is one of the most creative companies in the world, and in general I think it watches out for its users\u2019 privacy, security and well-being better than many of its rivals. (Well, other than its users in China, where Apple has become uncomfortably deferential to the government\u2019scontrols on freedom.) But the controls and fees it imposes on apps are indefensible.\nApple has clear market power in the app business, and because its software tends to lock users into its ecosystem \u2014 once you choose an iPhone, going to some other kind of phone is arduous \u2014 there is effectively little competition in the market for smartphones. That power must be policed. If the courts fail to do it, lawmakers ought to step in.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "Why Apple and Google\u2019s Virus Alert Apps Had Limited Success",
        "fulltext": "Sarah Cavey, a real estate agent in Denver, was thrilled last fall when Colorado introduced an app to warn people of possible coronavirus exposures.\nBased on software from Apple and Google, the state\u2019s smartphone app uses Bluetooth signals to detect users who come into close contact. If a user later tests positive, the person can anonymously notify other app users whom the person may have crossed paths with in restaurants, on trains or elsewhere.\nMs. Cavey immediately downloaded the app. But after testing positive for the virus in February, she was unable to get the special verification code she needed from the state to warn others, she said, even after calling Colorado\u2019s health department three times.\n\u201cThey advertise this app to make people feel good,\u201d Ms. Cavey said, adding that she had since deleted the app, calledCO Exposure Notifications, in frustration. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really doing anything.\u201d\nThe Colorado health department said it had improved its process and now automatically issues the verification codes to every person in the state who tests positive.\nWhen Apple and Googleannounced last yearthat they were working together to create a smartphone-based system to help stem the virus, their collaboration seemed like a game changer. Human contact tracers were struggling to keep up with spiking virus caseloads, and the trillion-dollar rival companies \u2014 whose systems run 99 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones \u2014 had the potential to quickly and automatically alert far more people.\nSoon Austria, Switzerland and other nations introduced virus apps based on the Apple-Google software, as did some two dozen American states, including Alabama and Virginia. To date, the apps have been downloaded more than 90 million times, according to an analysis by Sensor Tower, an app research firm.\nBut some researchers say the companies\u2019 product and policy choices limited the system\u2019s usefulness, raising questions about the power of Big Tech to set global standards for public health tools.\nComputer scientists have reported accuracy problems with the Bluetooth technology used to detect proximity between smartphones. Some users have complained of failed notifications. And there is little rigorous research to date on whether the apps\u2019 potential to accurately alert people of virus exposures outweighs potential drawbacks \u2014 like falsely warning unexposed people, over-testing or failing to detect users exposed to the virus.\n\u201cIt is still an open question whether or not these apps are assisting in real contact tracing, are simply a distraction, or whether they might even cause problems,\u201dStephen FarrellandDoug Leith, computer science researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, wrote ina report in April on Ireland\u2019s virus alert app.\nIn the United States, some public health officials and researchers said the apps had demonstrated modest but important benefits. In Colorado, more than 28,000 people have used the technology to notify contacts of possible virus exposures. In California, which introduced a virus-tracking app calledCA Notifyin December, about 65,000 people have used the system to alert other app users, the state said.\n\u201cExposure notification technology has shown success,\u201d saidDr. Christopher Longhurst, the chief information officer of UC San Diego Health, which manages California\u2019s app. \u201cWhether it\u2019s hundreds of lives saved or dozens or a handful, if we save lives, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\nIn a joint statement, Apple and Google said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to collaborate with public health authorities and provide a resource \u2014 which many millions of people around the world have enabled \u2014 that has helped protect public health.\u201d\nBased in part on ideas developed by Singapore\u2019s government and byacademics, Apple and Google\u2019s system incorporated privacy protections that gave health agencies an alternative to more invasive apps. Unlike virus-tracing apps that continuously track users\u2019 whereabouts, the Apple and Google software relies on Bluetooth signals, which can estimate the distance between smartphones without needing to know people\u2019s locations. And it uses rotating ID codes \u2014 not real names \u2014 to log app users who come into close contact for 15 minutes or more.\nSome health agencies predicted last year that the tech would be able to notify users of virus exposures faster than human contact tracers. Others said they hoped the apps could warn commuters who sat next to an infected stranger on a bus, train or plane \u2014 at-risk people whom contact tracers would not typically be able to identify.\n\u201cEveryone who uses the app is helping to keep the virus under control,\u201d Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germanysaid last year in a videopromoting the country\u2019s alert system, called Corona-Warn-App.\nBut the apps never received the large-scale efficacy testing typically done before governments introduce public health interventions like vaccines. And the software\u2019s privacy features \u2014 which prevent government agencies from identifying app users \u2014 have made it difficult for researchers to determine whether the notifications helped hinder virus transmission, saidMichael T. Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\u201cThe apps played virtually no role at all in our being able to investigate outbreaks that occurred here,\u201d Dr. Osterholm said.\nSome limitations emerged even before the apps were released. For one thing, some researchers note, exposure notification software inherently excludes certain vulnerable populations, such as elderly people who cannot afford smartphones. For another thing, they say, the apps may send out false alarms because the system is not set up to incorporate mitigation factors like whether users are vaccinated, wearing masks or sitting outside.\nProximity detection in virus alert apps can also be inconsistent. Last year,a study on Google\u2019s systemfor Android phones conducted on a light-rail tram in Dublin reported that the metal walls, flooring and ceilings distorted Bluetooth signal strength to such a degree that the chance of accurate proximity detection would be \u201csimilar to that of triggering notifications by randomly selecting\u201d passengers.\nSuch glitches have irked early adopters likeKimbley Craig, the mayor of Salinas, Calif. Last December, when virus rates there were spiking, she said, she downloaded the state\u2019s exposure notification app on her Android phone and soon after tested positive for Covid-19. But after she entered the verification code, she said, the system failed to send an alert to her partner, whom she lives with and who had also downloaded the app.\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t pick up a person in the same household, I don\u2019t know what to tell you,\u201d Mayor Craig said.\nIn a statement, Steph Hannon, Google\u2019s senior director of product management for exposure notifications, said that there were \u201cknown challenges with using Bluetooth technology to approximate the precise distance between devices\u201d and that the company was continuously working to improve accuracy.\nThe companies\u2019 policies have also influenced usage trends. In certain U.S. states, for instance, iPhone users can activate the exposure notifications with one click \u2014 by simply turning on a feature on their settings \u2014 but Android users must download a separate app. As a result, about 9.6 million iPhone users in California had turned on the notifications as of May 10, the state said, far outstripping the 900,000 app downloads on Android phones.\nGoogle said it had built its system for states to work on the widest range of devices and be deployed as quickly as possible.\nSome public health experts acknowledged that the exposure alert system was an experiment in which they, and the tech giants, were learning and incorporating improvements as they went along.\nOne issue they discovered early on: To hinder false alarms, states verify positive test results before a person can send out exposure notifications. But local labs can sometimes take days to send test results to health agencies, limiting the ability of app users to quickly alert others.\nIn Alabama, for instance, the state\u2019s GuideSafe virus alert app has been downloaded about 250,000 times, according to Sensor Tower. But state health officials said they had been able to confirm the positive test results of only 1,300 app users. That is a much lower number than health officials would have expected, they said, given that more than 10 percent of Alabamians have tested positivefor the coronavirus.\n\u201cThe app would be a lot more efficient if those processes were less manual and more automated,\u201d said Dr. Scott Harris, who oversees the Alabama Department of Public Health.\nColorado, which automatically issues the verification codes to people who test positive, has reported higher usage rates. And in California, UC San Diego Health has set up a dedicated help line that app users can call if they did not receive their verification codes.\nDr. Longhurst, the medical center\u2019s chief information officer, said the California app had proved useful as part of a larger statewide public health push that also involved mask-wearing and virus testing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d he said. But \u201cit can be an effective part of a pandemic response.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Compromises in China: 5 Takeaways",
        "fulltext": "Over two decades, Apple builtthe world\u2019s most valuable company on top of China.It nowassembles nearly all of its productsin the country and generates a fifth of its sales there. In turn, the Chinese government has pressured Apple executives to make compromises that flout the values they espouse.\nAn investigation by The New York Timesrevealed how Apple has risked its Chinese customers\u2019 data and aided the Chinese government\u2019s censorship. Here are five takeaways:\nIn response to a 2017 Chinese law,Apple agreed to move its Chinese customers\u2019 data to Chinaand onto computers owned and run by a Chinese state-owned company.\nChinese government workers physically control and operate the data center. Apple agreed to store the digital keys that unlock its Chinese customers\u2019 information in those data centers. And Apple abandoned the encryption technology it uses in other data centers after China wouldn\u2019t allow it.\nIndependent security experts and Apple engineers said Apple\u2019s concessions would make it nearly impossible for the company to stop Chinese authorities from gaining access to the emails, photos, contacts, calendars and location data of Apple\u2019s Chinese customers.\nApple said it had retained control of the keys to the data and was using more advanced encryption technology in China than in other countries. \u201cWe have never compromised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nU.S. law has long prohibited Apple from turning over data to the Chinese authorities. But in moving data to China, Apple created a legal arrangement with the Chinese government that gets around U.S. laws.\nApple made Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the Guizhou provincial government, the legal owner of its Chinese customers\u2019 iCloud data. Apple and GCBD also inserted new language into the Chinese iCloud terms and conditions that granted them \u201caccess to all data that you store on this service\u201d and allowed the companies to share the data with each other. Chinese authorities now demand Apple customer data from GCBD, not Apple.\nBefore the arrangement, Apple said it had never provided the contents of a customer\u2019s iCloud account to the Chinese authorities. Since the arrangement, Apple has provided the contents of an undisclosed number of accounts in nine separate cases, it said.\nApple has created an internal bureaucracy that rejects or removes apps the company believes could run afoul of Chinese rules. Apple trains its app reviewers and uses special software to inspect apps for any mention of topics Apple has deemed off limits in China, including Tiananmen Square, the Chinese spiritual movement Falun Gong, the Dalai Lama, and independence for Tibet and Taiwan.\nApple said it removes apps in China to comply with local laws.\nIn 2018, China\u2019s internet regulators ordered Apple to reject an app fromGuo Wengui, a Chinese billionaire who had broadcast claims of corruption inside the Communist Party. Top Apple executives then decided to add Mr. Guo to Apple\u2019s \u201cChina sensitivities list,\u201d which meant software would scan apps for mention of him and app reviewers would be trained to reject his apps, according to court documents.\nWhen an app by Mr. Guo later slipped by Apple\u2019s defenses and was published to the App Store, Chinese officials contacted Apple wanting answers. Apple\u2019s app review chief then sent colleagues an email at 2:32 a.m. that said, \u201cThis app and any Guo Wengui app cannot be on the China store.\u201d Apple investigated the incident and later fired the app reviewer who had approved the app.\nApple said that it had fired the app reviewer for poor performance and that it had removed Mr. Guo\u2019s app in China because it had determined it was illegal there.\nSince 2017, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple\u2019s App Store in China, with most remaining available in other countries, according to a Times analysis.\nMore than 35,000 of those apps were games, which in China must get approval from regulators. The remaining 20,000 cut across a wide range of categories, including foreign news outlets, gay dating services and encrypted messaging apps. Apple also blocked tools for organizing pro-democracy protests andskirting internet restrictions, as well as apps about the Dalai Lama.\nApple disputed The Times\u2019s figures, saying that some developers removed their own apps from China."

You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nThorin Klosowski dug deep into new disclosures from iPhone apps that show what information they collect about us and for what purpose.\nHe emerged both confused and concerned about our digital economy, which relies on apps that are obfuscating what is happening with our personal information.\nThorin, an editor for The New York Times\u2019s product review site Wirecutter, spoke with me about his research into theapp tracking disclosures of 250 iPhone apps, why people should care about app tracking and tips for people to protect their information.\nWhy should people be bothered by digital data collection? If a weather app knows all of the times I went to McDonald\u2019s and in return I get local weather forecasts, isn\u2019t that a fair trade?\nFor many people, yes. But it\u2019s not a truly informed trade.\nLet\u2019s say you see in the description in the iPhone app store that a weather app records your location all of the time and keeps a record of all of the apps where you have entered the same email address. You have no way of knowing what the app maker needs that data for or whether that information is sold or shared with other companies.\nWhat could go wrong?\nThe facial recognition start-upClearview AI is an exampleof what happens when information that we put out in the world for one purpose gets collected and used for another \u2014 in that case, assembling an online photo database of millions of people \u2014 that none of the participants really consented to.\nWe have little control about what happens to our personal information. Even just trying to understand what happens to our data is exhausting. I have written about digital privacy for years, and I still find it extremely complicated.\nIs the bottom line that theseApple app privacy disclosures, which are modeled on food nutrition labels, are better than nothing but still not very useful?\nThat\u2019s it. These labels lack context. You can\u2019t compare apps easily, so it\u2019s difficult to know what\u2019s normal activity for an app in any category, and what might be overreaching.\nAnd after spending far more time than I anticipated digging into this, I\u2019m not confident that this information on app tracking is helpful. I\u2019m glad that theAppleprivacy labels exist, but only as a first step for the public to understand how the whole data-collection economy is fundamentally broken.\nLet\u2019s find something positive! Are there apps that you have looked at that collect relatively little data?\nThemessaging app Signalis one, and a notes app called Bear. And almost all of the games that were part of Apple Arcade, the company\u2019s $4.99 monthly video game subscription service, appeared to have minimal data collection.\nWhat\u2019s your advice to people who are concerned about their personal data being collected?\nApps on your phone that you\u2019re not using regularly needlessly expose you to more data collection. My top recommendations are to delete any apps that you\u2019re not using, and don\u2019t download an app at all if you\u2019re going to use it only once or occasionally. Using the website version of a service instead of the app is often a better alternative because the data collection tends to be less aggressive.\nIf you had absolute power, what\u2019s one thing that you would change to better preserve our personal data?\nI think I wouldget rid of personalized advertisingthat\u2019s based on what we do, where we go or what our interests are. Digital ads based on our personal information are at the root of what\u2019s wrong with our online economy.\nRead more:Androidsaidthat it planned to follow Apple\u2019s lead in requiring data collection disclosures in its app store. The Android data tracking labels will start next year.\nTip of the Week\nPersonalized ads aren\u2019t just on apps, they can follow you around websites, too. Here isBrian X. Chen,the consumer technology columnist for The Times, on ways to keep digital companies from collecting our personal information:\nTargeted ads are creepy. If you were window shopping in real life and looked at a pair of expensive shoes, would you want a flyer for the shoes to be permanently stuck to your car? That\u2019s basically how personalized online ads behave. I call them stalker ads.\nA few years ago, I wrote a column ondefeating stalker adswith brute force. Most of that advice is still relevant today. The bottom line is that you need multiple techniques to block ads on the web and inside mobile apps. Here are a few steps:\nInstall an ad blocker.For your web browser, you can install add-ons that block ads. My favorite one for computer browsers isuBlock Origin, and on iPhones I recommend1Blocker.\nFor Android users, Google banned many ad blockers from its official Play app store. The simplest way to block ads is by using a private web browser, as I detail next.\nOn mobile devices, use a private browser.Firefox Focus,DuckDuckGoandBraveare privacy-centric mobile browsers that include built-in ad and tracker blocking. These are handy when you want to do a discreet web search. I wrote more about these web browsershere.\nInstall a tracker blocker.These detect computer code on websites that snoop on people and prevent the trackers from loading. My favorite tracker blocker for desktop systems isDisconnect.me, and for mobile devices I like Barracuda CloudGen Access (free on bothiOSandAndroid). Here is more on Apple\u2019s new settings that allow iPhone owners toask apps not to track them.\nA scary computer attack on a fuel pipeline:Cybercriminals forced the temporary shutdown of a pipeline that carries nearly half of the East Coast\u2019s gasoline and jet fuel supply. My colleagues looked atwhat this might do to fuel prices, and whether such critical infrastructure would be better protected under a White House draft proposal tomandate digital security standardsfor federal agencies and contractors.\nFrom last month:Nicole Perlroth explained why infrastructure like pipelines areso vulnerable to ransomware, the type of cyberattack that affected this fuel pipeline.\nCampus contention over virtual exam proctoring:Some Dartmouth medical students accused of cheating on online exams said that administrators relied on faulty data from course assignment software thattracked student activity during remote exams without their knowledge. My colleagues Natasha Singer and Aaron Krolik examined the campus tensions at Dartmouth and asked: Can technology used to catch cheaters be accurate, fair and transparent?\nBack to classrooms isn\u2019t that simple:Some children and parentsaren\u2019t eager to return to in-person schoolbecause they have reordered their lives in the past year in ways they don\u2019t want to undo, my colleague Dana Goldstein reported. It\u2019s a nuanced analysis of what experts call \u201cschool hesitancy,\u201d and what officials are doing to convince families to return.\nWe should love wasps! They control pests, pollinate plants and do other important tasks to help ecosystems, human health and the economy. Also, \u201cthey can strip a bird clear of meat within a few hours,\u201d a behavioral ecologist told CNN.\nWe want to hear from you.
