        "fulltext": "Want this in your inbox each morning?Sign up here.\nThe stock market had its worst day in months yesterday, with the S&P 500 index dropping nearly 6 percent. Or, as The Times\u2019s Matt Phillipsput it, \u201cAt least for a day, reality triumphed over hope on Wall Street.\u201d\nBack in the red for the year:At the beginning of this week, a heady stock rally erased all of the market\u2019s losses for the year, even as pandemic lockdowns curtailed activity and companies reported ugly quarterly earnings. Yesterday\u2019s plunge pushed the S&P 500 back below where it began the year (and more than 10 percent off its all-time high, set in February).\n\u2022 That said, futures suggest a pretty big bounce at the open, regaining about a third of yesterday\u2019s fall.\nBlip or bear market?Broadly speaking, there are two schools of thought:\n\ud83d\udcc8 The steep decline during the early stages of the pandemic was a short-term, virus-induced stumble during a rally that began more than 10 years ago.\n\ud83d\udcc9 The sharp rise in recent months was a momentary rally masking a bear market that could roar back if there\u2019s asecond waveof infections orlong-term economic damagefrom the lockdowns.\nLooking at history as a guideis tricky, because it\u2019s been more than a century since investors had to reckon with a pandemic. If you plot the market from its peak versus other bear markets in recent history, the bullish case is that stocks could behave as they did in 1990 after Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. That would mean another three or four months before stocks set a new high; other market downturns took a lot longer to regain lost ground.\n\u2022 Bloomberg\u2019s John Authers notesthe 1990 analogy, pointing out that the market reached a new peak after Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait. But, he asks: \u201cIs there any way to achieve a comparably clear victory over the coronavirus?\u201d\nHertz filed for bankruptcy protection last month. But as investors improbably piled into its shares this week, the car rental pioneer is trying to take advantage of this unexpected turn of events.\nThe company wants to sell up to $1 billion in new stock.\u201cThe recent market prices of and the trading volumes in Hertz\u2019s common stock potentially present a unique opportunity,\u201d lawyers for the companysaid in a bankruptcy court hearingyesterday.\n\u2022 Even after falling to $2.06 yesterday, the company\u2019s shares are still way above the 56 cents they traded at after the Chapter 11 filing.\n\u2022 Some company insiders took advantage of the rally byunloading their sharesthis week.\nThe move is exceedingly rare for a bankrupt company, since most Chapter 11 restructurings result in stockholders \u2014 who are last in line to recover financial assets \u2014 being wiped out.\nIt\u2019s possible that stockholders could get some moneyafter Hertz restructures. After all, the hedge fund mogul Bill Ackmanmade a fortunefrom owning stock in the bankrupt real-estate business General Growth Properties nearly a decade ago. But in a sign of Hertz\u2019s dire financial straits, the company has asked for permission to end leases for more than 144,000 vehicles that it says it can no longer afford.\nAmid the protests set off by the police killing of George Floyd, corporate America is making more promises to combat racism and discrimination.\nSome of the latest moves:\n\u2022AppleandYouTubeeach pledged $100 million for race initiatives. Apple willdonate moneytoward education and criminal justice reform, though it gave few details about what that will entail. YouTube willcreate a fundto highlight black creators on its platform, and in some cases directly fund black-focused content.\n\u2022 A founder ofThe Wing, Audrey Gelman,resigned as C.E.O.of the women-focused co-working company. She faced criticism for what current and former workers said was mistreatment of minority workers.\n\u2022Hasbroremoved cards from \u201cMagic: The Gathering,\u201d a popular fantasy card game, that featured offensive characters.\nBut the gap remains wide.The Financial Times notesthat management teams and corporate boards still have few black and other minority members, despite years of companies\u2019 pledging to improve diversity.\n\u2022 Kemi Role, a top official at the National Employment Law Project,told The Wall Street Journalthat improvements need to be made throughout companies: \u201cHow are their cafeteria workers being treated? How are their people in factories being treated?\u201d\n\u2022 Ultimately, companies will be judged on their results, Stephanie Creary of the Wharton business school notes ina list of tipsfor making meaningful corporate statements: \u201cIf you do nothing after saying something, your words will not matter.\u201d\nThe European Union is preparing an antitrust case against Amazon.Regulators plan to argue that the e-commerce giant has unfairly used third-party merchant data to promote its own products,The Times\u2019s Adam Satariano reports.\nGoldman Sachs wants to settle the 1MDB scandal without admitting guilt,The Times\u2019s Matt Goldstein reports. The Wall Street firm is pushing back against federal prosecutors who want the bank to pay over $2 billion in fines and plead guilty to a felony.\nWho are Joe Biden\u2019s economic advisers?It\u2019s unclearwho has the ear of the Democratic presidential candidate, and a recently formed economic policy committee urged participants to stay silent on what is discussed. That said, here\u2019sMr. Biden\u2019s planfor reopening the economy, released yesterday.\nYesterday we highlighted a study aboutpositive effects of small talk in the office, which the researchers called \u201cuplifting yet distracting.\u201d With so many offices and other workplaces now closed, there are fewer opportunities for superficial chitchat, which could be a good thing for efficiency. But judging by readers\u2019 response, you (mostly) miss it:\n\u2022 Everhard: \u201cSmall talk is an essential part of the informal organization, and without any informal organization a company will never work efficiently.\u201d\n\u2022 Karen: \u201cPersonally, I probably abused the time talking to fellow employees about non-work subjects and gossiping, but it was wonderful to be able to converse about things going on in the world outside. I give it a 70 percent good use of time.\u201d\n\u2022 Larry: \u201cAsking somebody how their weekend was, or how the kid\u2019s baseball game or school play went, is all part of how an organization grows.\u201d\n\u2022 Jasmin: \u201cI have enjoyed my solitude during this season of confinement.

        "title": "Apple Rejects Facebook\u2019s Gaming App, for at Least the Fifth Time",
        "fulltext": "Executives and engineers from Facebook\u2019s games division submitted their new app,Facebook Gaming, to Apple last month for approval to offer it in the iPhone maker\u2019s App Store.\nApple considered Facebook\u2019s application for a few weeks. This month, it delivered its verdict: denied.\nThe Facebook team was not surprised. It wasn\u2019t the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third.\nSince February, Apple has rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, according to three people with knowledge of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Each time, the people said, Apple cited its rules that prohibit apps with the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of distributing casual games.\nFacebook Gaming may also have been hurt by appearing to compete with Apple\u2019s own sales of games, two of the people said. Games are by far the most lucrative category of mobile apps worldwide. Apple\u2019s App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year.\nApple\u2019s rejections of the app from Facebook, a fellow Silicon Valley powerhouse, illustrate the control it exerts over the mobile software and entertainment ecosystem \u2014 clout that regulators are increasingly examining. On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it hadopened a formal antitrust investigation into Appleto determine if the terms that the company imposes on app developers violate competition rules.\n\u201cWe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy.\nThis week, Basecamp publicly complained that itsnew email app, Hey, had been denied from the App Store because it charged customers outside Apple\u2019s payment system, keeping the giant company from collecting its 30 percent cut.\n\u201cWe keep trying to find logic, consistency in Apple\u2019s App Store decisions,\u201d David Hansson, Basecamp\u2019s co-founder and chief technology officer,wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe answer is much more basic: power. Apple can do what they want, when they want, so they do.\u201d\nMr. Hansson added that the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division had contacted him earlier to talk about Apple.\nApple, which will hold its annual developer conference next week, said the App Store has many apps that offer casual games and that follow its rules, including the main Facebook app.\nFacebook said it would release Facebook Gaming when Apple approved it.\nApple has long taken a \u201cwalled garden\u201d approach to its mobile devices while its main mobile competitor, Google and its Android operating system, has adopted a more laissez-faire philosophy. Both companies take 30 percent of most purchases on their app stores, leaving 70 percent to app developers.\n\u201cApple and Google Play have always pursued different strategies for their app stores, which align with the closed ecosystem \u2014 Apple \u2014 versus open ecosystem \u2014 Google \u2014 company attributes,\u201d said Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at Newzoo, a game industry research firm.\nApple has said it monitors its App Store ecosystem closely to ensure the highest standards of quality and security. According to itsApp Store principles: \u201cWhen you download an app, it should work as promised. We carefully review each app and require developers to follow strict guidelines on privacy, design and business models.\u201d\nBut over time, that has increasingly grated on some app developers. The European Union investigation into Apple was spurred by acomplaint last year from Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store, arguing that it amounts to a tax that violates competition laws.\nFacebook announced its Gaming app in April as people were sheltering in place from the coronavirus pandemic and playing more video games. For the social network, the new app was a way to more deeply engage its users.\nThe free app has three main components: watching live streams of other people playing games; socially networking with other gamers; and playing simple games like Words With Friends and Thug Life. On both Apple and Android devices, those simple games can be delivered within Facebook Gaming\u2019s app using software called HTML5.\nGoogle quickly approved Facebook Gaming for its Google Play app store and beganoffering the appworldwide on April 20. In the Android version of Facebook Gaming, a catalog of simple games is presented by category and with colorful icons. Some of those games allow players to spend real money for in-game purchases.\nFacebook initially submitted its Gaming app to Apple for approval in late February, said the people with knowledge of the situation. Apple rejected that version, they said, citingSection 4.7 of its app rules, which state that HTML5 games are allowed \u201cas long as code distribution isn\u2019t the main purpose of the app\u201d and \u201cthe code is not offered in a store or store-like interface,\u201d among other restrictions.\nBut the initial version of the Gaming app that Facebook showed to Apple was similar to the Android version, listing games by category in a manner that could be interpreted as \u201cstore-like.\u201d\nTrying to get the Gaming app through Apple\u2019s review process, Facebook then changed the design of the presentation of games in several ways, the people said. The colorful icons were removed in favor of a bland listing. The different games categories were removed to list all games at once. The ability to sort games was also taken away.\nFacebook also included a version that looked almost exactly like how such games are presented already within the main Facebook app on Apple devices, which is a single unalphabetized, unsortable list, the people said.\nApple said no to each of them, pointing to the same rule, they said.\nIn Facebook\u2019s most recent submission, the Gaming app did not include a separate tab for playable games and included no way for the user to choose from a wide selection of games to play, the people said. Instead, that version suggested certain games within the user\u2019s news and activity feed.\nApple denied it.\nSince then, Facebook has been weighing its next move. The company is considering releasing Facebook Gaming on Apple devices without playable games at all, the people with knowledge of the social network said. Another option, they said, is continuing to make playable games even more difficult for users to find within the app."

        "title": "Collect Smartwatches? Don\u2019t Make Watch Fans Laugh.",
        "fulltext": "Smartwatches don\u2019t get much love in collecting circles.\nMechanical watch fans have called the devices soulless and mass-produced, an abomination, a horror, even rubbish. Daniel Sum, co-founder of the Shanghai Watch Gang, a collectors club, and the Shanghai Watch Festival, said that the Apple Watch, in particular, wasn\u2019t worthy of its name. \u201cJust because it has the word \u2018watch\u2019 in it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a watch,\u201d he said, adding that the device wouldn\u2019t \u201cget a look in\u201d at any of his events.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a proper watch. And if someone comes in arguing that it is, they\u2019ll get absolutely killed,\u201d he said.\nAdam Craniotes, co-founder of the watch collecting club RedBar and an editor at large at the watch magazine Revolution, has experienced such shaming first hand.\nEarlier this year heposted a photoof his new Apple Watch on his Instagram channel \u2014 and some of his more than 36,000 followers were outraged. One referred to the end of the world, another threatened to \u201cunsubscribe,\u201d one helpfully suggested that Mr. Craniotes thoroughly wash his wrist after wearing it.\nYet there also were messages of support, with one asking, why all the hate? Another foresaw Mr. Craniotes becoming a convert (indeed, Mr. Craniotes said he had been wearing the watch a lot during lockdown. It\u2019s \u201chandy for commandeering the Apple TV when the remote goes missing,\u201d he said, and has helped him find his misplaced phone).\nSo why do smartwatches irritate watch fans so much? And why aren\u2019t they considered just as collectible as any analog timepiece?\nOne of the key reasons clearly is time \u2014 or, rather, the transcendence of it. Mechanical watches are rooted in timelessness: Handcrafted from precious metals and running on kinetic energy, they are built to last and meant to be passed down, ultimately transcending time.\nSmartwatches, on the other hand, are battery-powered tech with planned obsolescence, said Jeremy White, executive editor at Wired Magazine in Britain. Like TVs and laptops, smartwatches are designed to last only a certain number of years before the technology moves on. \u201cIt\u2019s all about upgrading and getting a better product. And getting rid of the old one,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing like the traditional watch market.\u201d\nAnd even though the batteries are rechargeable, \u201cthe product itself is rendered useless\u201d once its life cycle is up, Mr. White said.\nThere also is the issue of rarity. Smartwatches are cheaper than mechanical watches \u2014 around $500 compared with at least $1,000 for a luxury mechanical piece \u2014 a difference that, in the eyes of collectors, indicates mass production and equally mass accessibility.\nAnd nothing says mass like the Apple Watch. The companyhas never releasedsales numbers, but the research company Strategy Analyticsestimatedthat 31 million Apple Watches were shipped in 2019, more than the products of all Swiss watch brands combined.\n\u201cThey\u2019re everywhere,\u201d Mr. Sum said.\nWearing one certainly isn\u2019t a personal statement, and it won\u2019t make you stand out in a crowd like a rare mechanical watch can. \u201cIf I\u2019m at a board meeting,\u201d Mr. Craniotes said, \u201cnine out of 10 people sitting around will be wearing an Apple Watch. It doesn\u2019t say anything about me.\u201d\nThen there is the most basic function of a timepiece: keeping time.\nEarly versions of the Apple Watch didn\u2019t even show the time until the wearer activated the display, and some fans have said the \u201calways on\u201d display of the Series 5 devices, introduced last September, was what finally drew their approval. \u201cTo me, it was finally acting like a watch,\u201d Mr. Craniotes said.\nBut smartwatch buyers are not motivated by knowing the time, said Brian Duffy, chief executive of the Watches of Switzerland Group, which sells both smart and mechanical watches in its more than 120 stores in Britain and the United States. \u201cThe motivation is communication, health, fitness, reading \u2014 all of these things,\u201d he said, \u201candit happens to tell the time.\u201d\nStill, such features \u2014 and the ability to access them quickly \u2014 are becoming ever more relevant to modern life. Mr. Craniotes said he recently had observed RedBar members coming to events wearing both a smartwatch and a mechanical timepiece, and, like himself, they are increasingly at ease owning both (\u201cWatch collectors tend to be technology minded,\u201d he said).\nResearch conducted by Watches of Switzerland found that it is not a matter of either/or: Only 1 percent of smartwatch owners said they did not plan to use a traditional watch costing at least 1,000 pounds in the future.\nFelix Obschonka, Montblanc\u2019s director of new technologies, owns both kinds of watches \u2014 and wears both, he said, \u201cwith the same passion but for different uses.\u201d\nEach watch serves its purpose, Mr. Obschonka said: \u201cIf you go for sport, you definitely go for a smartwatch because you get all the stats. But if you go to the opera, maybe the smartwatch, with its display lighting up, is not the best occasion for it. It\u2019s striking that balance, and if you\u2019re a sophisticated customer, you\u2019re aware of this.\u201d\nMontblanc and its parent company, the Swiss giant Richemont, do not disclose the sales of individual brands, but Mr. Obschonka said the coronavirus crisis had produced demand for smartwatches, especially ones with advanced fitness and health tracking. Montblanc offers such a smartwatch, the Summit \u2014 and this month it plans to introduce its third-generation watch, called Summit 2+, with enhanced fitness features.\nA growing collector base for other digital products also may signal a future for smartwatch collectibility. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen mint condition, first-edition Apple products going for very good money to collectors,\u201d said Mr. White of Wired magazine. \u201cSo, undoubtedly, there will be people out there who have squirreled smartwatches away.\u201d\nOne such enthusiast is Giulio Zompetti, a project manager at an information technology company in the Lombardy region of Italy. He owns 12 Apple Watch prototypes that he purchased as a single batch, and that came from an e-waste facility (\u201cThey were full of metal and glass dust and really did stink,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know what they went through\u201d).\nA keen collector of Apple iPhones, he said he was drawn to the prototypes because they all predate the watch\u2019s2014 introduction. \u201cThis is the coolest way to find out what was before these watches came on the market. I think it\u2019s beautiful to see how the device changed in one single year through the different stages of prototyping,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone is really passionate about hardware, these are jewels. You can randomly pick two of them and nothing is similar between them.\u201d\nBut don\u2019t expect a smartwatch to grace the cover of an auction catalog anytime soon. At least that\u2019s the opinion of John Reardon, formerly international head of watches at Christie\u2019s andnow the founder of Collectability.com, which works with buyers and sellers of Patek Philippe watches.\n\u201cTime has a way of bringing around the unexpected, and everything will become \u2018vintage\u2019 someday,\u201d Mr. Reardon wrote in an email. \u201cI do imagine a day in 10 to 20 years when collecting smartwatches will be a real collecting category.\u201d\nProvenance will play a key role, he said, as it does in all collecting genres. \u201cOwning a smartwatch worn by Bill Gates, for example, would be quite interesting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr Sting\u2019s Casio J-100 or Michael J. Fox\u2019s calculator watch from \u2018Back to the Future\u2019would also be quite fun!\u201d\nIndeed, some potentially collectible smartwatches already exist, Mr. Duffy said, citing theHublot Big Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russiaas an example. The $5,200 timepiece, worn by referees during World Cup matches, displayed real-time statistics like the score, names of goal-scorers, player substitutions and match time.\nThere were only 2,018 pieces in the limited edition and, Mr. Duffy said, the ones allocated to his stores sold out quickly (much like each new generation of theTAG Heuer Connectedsmartwatch, he said).\nPerhaps the same appeal will extend to Hublot\u2019s new Big Bang e, a connected watch featuring the company\u2019s popular Big Bang design, which was introduced last week.\nAnd one should never underestimate the power of nostalgia.\nFor example, collectingCasio G-Shocks\u2014 the robust, hard-wearing digital timepieces \u2014 is a thing among watch fans (both Mr. Craniotes and Mr. Sum own them), driven in part by sentiment for their 1980s heyday.\nCould the Apple Watch in, say, 30 years come to symbolize our lives now? And become a collector\u2019s prize? Only time will tell."

Instead, readers will get an honest look at a burgeoning industry backed by big investors who see cultured meat\u2019s many upsides but also recognize its many hurdles.\nYou call it \u201ccell-cultured meat\u201d and not \u201clab-grown meat\u201d or \u201cfake meat\u201d or other names that sometimes come up.\nThe weirdest name I heard someone use was \u201cmotherless meat.\u201d Gross. The name game can be a bizarre rabbit hole. Because of that, I stuck to a term that\u2019s scientifically accurate and not aphoristic.\nWere there any misconceptions you had about the industry going into it?\nIt turned out to be a more dramatic story than I anticipated. At one point, through pure happenstance, I watched firsthand the dramatic collapse of one startup\u2019s attempt to serve up cell-cultured meat in the Netherlands. That was the moment I really understood that there\u2019s an edible space race going on among cultured meat companies, and the winner will get the first shot at capturing public imagination \u2014 and tons of investment.\nWho are the key players?\nIn the short term, in the U.S. folks in business are going to gravitate toward Memphis Meats, which has a regulatory edge; JUST, an already-functioning food company; and Finless Foods, which is ahead of the curve in seafood. Mosa Meat in the Netherlands has a great shot at getting E.U. approval first. In the long term, though, I\u2019m most drawn to what\u2019s happening in Israel, at Aleph Farms and Future Meat Technologies.\nWhat\u2019s the strangest thing you ate during your reporting?\nThe first thing I was served was foie gras. On its surface that seemed pretty ho-hum, but then I realized it was basically just cultured meat paste that\u2019d been scraped out of a bioreactor. It was fine, but mentally took a minute to process.\nWhat do you hope readers take away from the book?\nThere\u2019s enough money and influence behind cell-cultured meat that, even if it inspires squeamishness, it simply can\u2019t be ignored. There are a ton of upsides, especially in light of how the coronavirus has pummeled the U.S. meat industry. It may be the most optimistic and realistic shot we\u2019ve got at addressing animal agriculture\u2019s massive environmental footprint.\nDeals\n\u2022 The coming I.P.O. of Albertsons, the grocery-market giant, could raise as much as $1.5 billion for existing investors like Cerberus.

        "title": "Is It Finally Hammer Time for Apple and Its App Store?",
        "fulltext": "The tech faceplant of the week goes to Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, who recently released a video in which he and his wife said they were \u201cdeeply shaken and disgusted by President Trump\u2019s divisive and incendiary rhetoric at a time when our nation so desperately needs unity.\u201d It was a case study in hownotto read the room, especially when you are in charge of a huge service that has been one of the main digital tools that has helped the president divide and set fire to the body politic.\nMr. Zuckerberg is an easy go-to when it comes to pointing out the hypocrisy of the powerful playacting as the aggrieved. It\u2019s irksome, and it\u2019s also easy to mock, but in truth most of the battles between the digital Davids and Goliaths are much more complex.\nConsider, for example, the fight this week between Apple and a small tech company \u2014 a quarrel that you might want to pay attention to since the outcome could have a lasting impact on the power dynamic between Big Tech and the rest of us.\nThe kerfuffle between the trillion-dollar tech giant and the founders of Basecamp, a nifty project management tool, centers on an innovative new email service that Basecamp created called Hey.com. As part of theHey.comrollout, the company submitted the mobile app to Apple\u2019s App Store. A spot there is critical for its success.\nAnd how \u2014 given that access to the mobile universe is controlled by just two companies: Apple and Google. As one person intimately familiar with the mobile ecosystem noted to me, Apple and Google are the \u201ctwo tollbooths\u201d for us all.\nTollbooth is just the right metaphor. While you can use various services like Hey.com on the web through browsers, when it comes to mobile, app developers are subject to whatever guidelines Apple and Google impose and the fees they charge.\nApple has asserted its curatorial might most strongly, by far, often in the interests of taming the sprawling and enormous app deluge. Their oversight includes efforts to protect privacy and eliminate dangerous developers who attempt to foist spam and malware on consumers. Mistakes slip through, but Apple runs a tidy ship.\nYet Apple has also changed rules in ways that many developers find capricious and unfair and, more to the point, scary. While complaints have been raised for a long time about what Ben Thompson of Stratechery calls Apple\u2019s \u201crent-seeking\u201d practices, many developers do not want to speak out for fear of falling afoul of Apple and, worse, getting banned from its store.\nBut not Basecamp\u2019s iconoclastic and outspoken founders, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, who took to Twitter and other media to complain loudly after the Hey.com app had been accepted by Apple and then flagged for being in violation of its rules last week. In practice, that means Hey.com cannot make crucial bug updates. The company was awaiting an appeal decision by Apple that came down Thursday and that demands that Basecamp make changes in order to keep its Hey.com app on the platform.\nApple executives had told me and others earlier this week that it erred in its original approval of Hey.com, since the email service, which costs $99 per year, did not include the Apple-friendly in-app payment system as required by its rules.\nThe payment system, the only one available to developers when using Apple\u2019s App Store, means Apple gets a huge cut when a customer buys digital goods like an app subscription (30 percent for the first year and 15 percent thereafter). Apple does not get a fee when customers sign up through the app\u2019s company website, and it's worth noting that 84 percent of apps are free, and developers pay nothing to Apple.\nThere is no doubt that Apple\u2019s payment system is convenient for some developers. And Apple correctly touts that it has created a lucrative business platform for many companies ($519 billion in overall revenue in 2019). But because of Apple\u2019s cut, some companies try to minimize in-app transactions, either by avoiding offering in-app subscriptions at all (Netflix) or charging more for that particular sign-up (Spotify). Hey.com did not include Apple\u2019s payment tech in its app.\nApple has made exceptions for some services that fall into what it calls a \u201creader\u201d category and has given other services a pass for a variety of reasons; it has even struck individual deals to bypass grabbing a cut. Still, Apple has decided thus far that Hey.com does not merit special treatment, even though there are also some subscription email apps that don\u2019t offer in-app purchase technology and are allowed to operate on Apple\u2019s platform (for now).\nApple\u2019s approach can be confusing \u2014 and definitely irritating. It hasn\u2019t sat well with Basecamp, as evidenced in a tweetstorm by Mr. Heinemeier Hansson. While he has a reputation for speaking out, this time Mr. Heinemeier Hansson has ended up in one of the more epic App Store controversies (best boiled down to his accusation that Apple was acting like \u201cgangsters\u201d). He likened Apple\u2019s actions to smashing windows and burning down stores.\n\u201cThey count on developers to stay quiet,\u201d he said in an agitated interview this week, referring to Apple executives. \u201cWe thought we were fighting an email market dominated by Google, but these were the real heavies.\u201d\nApple obviously does not agree with this assessment.\n\u201cThese rules have been around the App Store since the day we started,\u201d said Phil Schiller, who is in charge of the App Store and noted that the company reviews over 100,000 apps every week. \u201cThere is no perfection here. We will admit it when we make a mistake and acknowledge that we also need to learn and grow,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this was rejected for a good reason.\u201d\nThis dispute comes just as the European Union said this week that it hadopened an investigationinto whether Apple unfairly shakes down developers vying to distribute their wares on the App Store.\nThe longtime Silicon Valley thornMargrethe Vestager, the European Union\u2019s antitrust head, said the company had now \u201cobtained a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 role,\u201d and, because of that, \u201cwe need to ensure that Apple\u2019s rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers.\u201d\nShe was referring to problems first raised by Spotify, the popular music service, which is now in direct competition with Apple Music. Spotify\u2019s complaints of Apple\u2019s anticompetitive behavior, filed more than a year ago, led to the European Union move. Spotify\u2019s top lawyer, Horacio Gutierrez, said in an interview with me that the situation with Hey.com is strikingly familiar.\n\u201cI have to say a lot of Hey\u2019s experience is reminiscent of what we have been living,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is Apple continues to move the goal posts and change the rules to its advantage and the detriment of developers.\u201d\nAt a press event last week about the European Union investigation, Mr. Gutierrez used a sports metaphor, too, saying that \u201cApple acts as stadium owner, referee and player and tilts the playing field to favor its own services.\u201d He added that \u201ctheir selective and capricious enforcement is designed to put companies like ours at an untenable competitive disadvantage.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want special treatment or a free ride,\u201d Mr. Gutierrez said. \u201cWe want fair treatment and the opportunity to compete without artificial obstacles put in our way,\u201d a point also made by the Basecamp team.\nSpotify has thus pushed for a choice of payment systems within the App Store rather than having to use Apple\u2019s proprietary system, along with more ability to communicate with its own users.\nUnhappy developers are not new for Apple or to any tech company. But Apple is not just facing regulatory issues in Europe.\nThe Justice Department has an open and active investigation specifically looking into Apple monopolization and self-preferencing in the App Store, said sources. The agency has already revealed that it is officially looking at Google over a range of practices around market power. And Congress is also prepping a big antitrust hearing soon, which Apple and other tech giants will likely attend.\nMr. Heinemeier Hansson testified before Congress last year, excoriating Apple, as well as Facebook and Google, before the House antitrust subcommittee. He ended his jeremiad with a plea, \u201cHelp us, Congress. You\u2019re our only hope.\u201d\nHe sounded more hopeless this week, calling dealing with Apple\u2019s app approval process a \u201cwheel of misfortune.\u201d And, referring to the now defunct browser that ran right into another tech giant\u2019s cross hairs, Mr. Heinemeier Hansson sent a text to me later: \u201cThe wheels of legislative justice turn slow. It didn\u2019t help Netscape any that Microsoft got some penalties years after its air supply had been cut off.\u201d\nIt goes without saying that this is not how Apple sees itself, having spent years brandishing its image as the breaker and not maker of chains \u2014 see the famous1984 Apple Macintosh commercial.\nThe question is whether anyone throwing a hammer at power these days can throw it hard enough to make a difference.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "The New York Times Pulls Out of Apple News",
        "fulltext": "The New York Times said on Monday that it was exiting its partnership withApple News, as news organizations struggle to compete with large tech companies for readers\u2019 attention and dollars.\nStarting on Monday, Times articles were no longer appearing alongside those from other publications in the curated Apple News feed available on Apple devices.\nThe Times is one of the first media organizations to pull out of Apple News. The Times, which has madeadding new subscribersa key business goal, said Apple had given it little in the way of direct relationships with readers and little control over the business. It said it hoped to instead drive readers directly to its own website and mobile app so that it could \u201cfund quality journalism.\u201d\n\u201cCore to a healthy model between The Times and the platforms is a direct path for sending those readers back into our environments, where we control the presentation of our report, the relationships with our readers and the nature of our business rules,\u201d Meredith Kopit Levien, chief operating officer, wrote in a memo to employees. \u201cOur relationship with Apple News does not fit within these parameters.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman said that The Times \u201conly offered Apple News a few stories a day,\u201d and that the company would continue to provide readers with trusted information from thousands of publishers.\n\u201cWe are also committed to supporting quality journalism through the proven business models of advertising, subscriptions and commerce,\u201d he said.\nThe news business has had a complicated relationship with Silicon Valley for decades. Companies like Google and Facebook havedecimatednewspaper advertising sales and disintermediated news sites by positioning their own platforms as one of the main ways that people can consume news.\nYet when Apple created a news app in late 2015, promising to work with publishers to help them build a business, many news executives were cautiously optimistic.\nUnlike other tech companies, Apple didn\u2019t compete with news sites for ad dollars. And Apple adopted an approach that was antithetical to how its Silicon Valley peers handled the headlines: It allowed only mainstream news organizations in the app, andhumans, not algorithms, ranked the top stories.\nApple\u2019s aggressive promotion of Apple News on iPhones has given it an audience ofroughly 125 million monthly readers, making the app one of the world\u2019s most widely read news sources. But advertising in the app has generated little revenue for news organizations. For any subscriptions sold in the app, Apple also takes a 30 percent cut.\nLast year, Appleintroduced a new wayfor publishers to make money: Apple News Plus, a subscription service inside its news app that offers access to hundreds of publications, which typically have digital paywalls, for $9.99 a month.\nApple told publishers that the service would deliver customers they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get. But many publications would be undercutting their own prices, and they would have to share half of the Apple News Plus revenues with dozens of other news organizations. Apple took the other half for itself.\nStill,many publishers took the gamble, including The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and Cond\u00e9 Nast, which publishes The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Wired. Months after its debut, many publishers were underwhelmed by the sales,according to Digiday, a digital media news site.\nExecutives at The Times passed on Apple News Plus and laterreduced the number of articlesit supplied to Apple News. In an interview withReuters last year, Mark Thompson, The Times\u2019s chief executive, warned other news organizations about the risks of teaming up with Apple.\n\u201cWe tend to be quite leery about the idea of almost habituating people to find our journalism somewhere else,\u201d he said.\nThe Times said last month that its total subscribers hadtopped six million. Revenue has been rising from digital subscriptions, even as the company grapples with an advertising downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Times has long had a complex relationship with the large tech companies. It has experimented with working with Facebook, including on an effort called Instant Articles several years ago.\nBut The Times stopped producing Instant Articles for the social network in 2017, saying itwasn\u2019t getting enough revenue. Now Facebook pays The Times to feature its articles in the news tab on Facebook\u2019s app, the company\u2019slatest effort to work with the news industry. Times articles also appear in Google News, which sends readers to publishers\u2019 websites, unlike Apple News, which generally keeps readers on Apple\u2019s app.\nIn her note to employees, Ms. Levien said that exiting the partnership with Apple News was not expected to have \u201ca material impact\u201d to The Times\u2019s business and that the company would work with Apple in other ways, including on apps, podcasts and hardware."

        "title": "After 15 Years, Apple Prepares to Break Up With Intel",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Silicon Valley is bracing for a long-expectedbreakup of Apple and Intel, signaling both the end of one of the tech industry\u2019s most influential partnerships and Apple\u2019s determination to take more control of how its products are built.\nApple has been working for years on designing chips to replace the Intel microprocessors used in Mac computers, according to five people with knowledge of the effort, who weren\u2019t authorized to speak about it. They say Apple could announce its plans as soon as a company conference for developers on Monday, with computers based on the new chips arriving next year.\nApple\u2019s move is an indication ofthe growing power of the biggest tech companiesto expand their abilities and reduce their dependence on major partners that have provided them with services for years \u2014 even as smaller competitors and the global economy struggle because of the coronavirus pandemic.\nFacebook, for example, is investing billions of dollars into one of Indonesia\u2019s fastest-growing apps, a telecom giant in India and an undersea fiber-optic cable around Africa. Amazon has built out its own fleet of cargo planes and delivery trucks. And Google and Apple continue to buy upstarts to expand their empires.\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the partner Apple uses to build similar components it designs for iPhones and iPads, is expected to make the Mac chips in factories in Asia \u2014 an arrangement much like Apple\u2019s use of Foxconn to assemble iPhones.\nIntel and Apple declined to comment. Bloombergpreviously reported on Apple\u2019s plans.\nOther big tech companies like Amazon and Google already design some of their own chips, both for performance and potential cost reasons. Some tasks, like artificial intelligence and the rendering of 3-D images, can be handled more efficiently on special-purpose circuitry rather than the general-purpose microprocessors that are Intel\u2019s mainstay.\nSince 2005, Macs have used effectively the same Intel chips that most PCs do. Making its own processors would give Apple even more control over how Mac computers work. Apple has always designed the chips used in iPhones and iPads, adding features to customize designs licensed by Arm, a semiconductor firm owned by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Apple\u2019s forthcoming Mac chips are also expected to rely on Arm technology, improving compatibility with its mobile devices.\nApple has created a large chip-design team, building on the 2008 purchase of a 150-employee start-up, PA Semi. A large number of them once worked at Intel, including Johny Srouji, who reports directly to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook.\nApple\u2019s move would be a symbolic blow to Intel, particularly when civilian and military officials are concerned over the weakening of American leadership in chip manufacturing, which they regard as crucial to the country\u2019s ability to retain an edge over China. Legislation introduced in Congress last week, with rare bipartisan agreement, would funnel tens of billions of dollars to bolstering U.S. research and manufacturing in semiconductors.\nIntel has long been a U.S. standard-bearer in the semiconductor business, particularly in the complex manufacturing processes that turn silicon wafers into the chips that power computers, smartphones, cars and consumer devices.\nThe move\u2019s financial impact on Intel would be muted, at least in the short term. Intel sells Apple about $3.4 billion in chips for Macs each year, according to C.J. Muse, an Evercore analyst. That is less than 5 percent of Intel\u2019s annual sales, and Mr. Muse forecast that the blow would be closer to half that since Apple might change the chips on only some Mac models. Apple sells nearly 20 million Macs a year.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not chicken feed, but it\u2019s compared to total PCs sold of about 260 million\u201d a year, said Tim Bajarin, an analyst who has tracked Apple for nearly 40 years. Intel supplies the chips for just about every PC.\nBut the long-term effects could still be serious for Intel. The chipmaker\u2019s lofty profit margins have long been linked to its track record of delivering the most powerful computing engines on the market, particularly for laptops and computer servers. But Intel has never done well selling chips for newer tech products like smartphones and tablets.\nApple\u2019s last chip transition for Macs, in 2005, was viewed as a major step in the long-term comeback orchestrated by Steve Jobs, one of the company\u2019s founders, as well as a big victory for Intel. Macs had long relied on a design, called PowerPC, that was a collaboration among Apple, Motorola and IBM. But Mr. Jobs bet that Intel could provide much faster performance.\nThat selling point has been undermined by troubling news from Intel\u2019s huge factories. Much of the company\u2019s success in computers stems from its history of packing more transistors on each square of silicon, which allows the chips to keep carrying out more computing tasks at a lower cost.\nBut Intel has stumbled badly in that industrywide race to miniaturize. Intel\u2019s latest process for making chips, once expected as early as 2015, did not enter high-volume production until 2019. The delay aided Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung Electronics, which produce chips designed by multiple companies. The competitors exploited Intel\u2019s lag to take a technology lead.\n\u201cIntel has fallen behind by 12 months, maybe 18 months,\u201d said Handel Jones, chief executive of International Business Strategies, which offers consulting services to the chip industry.\nApple was troubled by the production stumble, according to three people familiar with the situation, who were not authorized to speak about confidential dealings between the companies. Intel also ran into stronger-than-expected demand for other types of chips, causing production shortages that crimped sales for some PC makers last year. The combination further tarnished Intel\u2019s image as a reliable producer.\nRobert Swan, Intel\u2019s chief executive,has vowed to make the changesnecessary to regain technology leadership and prevent product shortages. But if Apple succeeds in offering Macs with its own chips that seem noticeably superior to Intel\u2019s, analysts and industry executives said, other PC makers might shift more models to chips from rivals like Advanced Micro Devices or even start designing their own chips, though that would take years.\n\u201cI think it could inspire other companies to look at non-Intel processors,\u201d said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. \u201cReputationally, this is not a good thing for Intel.\u201d\nMicrosoft, a longtime Intel partner, already sells some laptop computers with Arm-based chips from Qualcomm, though analysts said their performance didn\u2019t match that of models powered by Intel technology. If that situation changes, they add, Apple and Intel could become outright rivals, using their hefty marketing might to counter each other\u2019s technical claims.\nAnother trend making it easier for Apple to consider the shift is the increasing use of web-based software, rather than software running on people\u2019s PCs and tailored for their hardware.\nStill, Macs in particular are a mainstay of certain creative professions, such as animation and film editing, and developers of those software applications will have to modify Mac programs to take advantage of Apple\u2019s new chips. That could lead to a delay in some software working for the new Macs when they are released, said Jeff Johnson, a Mac developer in Madison, Wis.\n\u201cThe professional software is the hardest and slowest software to make big changes to, so those are the types that you may not see ready on Day 1,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new Macs may have some issues out of the gate.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Announces New Privacy Features",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nGreetings, friends! I\u2019m your personal tech columnist. I\u2019ll be taking the wheel for today\u2019s intro.\nThis week is a big one for Apple, which is hosting itsannual conference for the software developerswho make apps for Apple phones, tablets, watches and computers. The company started the weeklong event with a video presentation streamed on Monday, outlining its new features.\nThe presentation was chock-full of jargon and deeply technical stuff that only engineers would understand. But here\u2019s the news that you may care about:\nApple is making it tougher for apps to track you.Unbeknown to many of us, thousands of apps that we lovingly use on our smartphones haveinvisible trackers running in the background. The trackers may be collecting and sharing our personal information, like our location, email address and phone number, with businesses and other entities for the purpose of serving targeted ads. You can\u2019t opt in or opt out ofapp tracking.\nThat may soon change. Apple said that beginning this fall with its next mobile operating system, iOS 14, it will require so-called third-party apps to ask for your permission to track you.\nApple will also give iPhone and iPad users more control over how their location is shared. Instead of sharing your precise location with an app, you will be able to share your approximate location, giving a developer a rough idea of where you are. That could be helpful if you are using a news app, for example, and you want to see articles about your hometown but don\u2019t want to share precisely where you live.\nIn the past, Apple and Google have required apps to ask for permission to access sensors, such as your camera and microphone. These new protections expand on Apple\u2019s efforts to give users greater transparency and control over the data collected about us. (Your move, Google.)\nThe Mac is about to make a big shift. Have you ever noticed how sluggish Macs feel compared to Apple\u2019s mobile devices? Macs use Intel processors, but mobile processors have outpaced Intel chips in terms of speed and power efficiency. Even the cheapest new Apple phone, the$399 iPhone SE, by some measures outperforms the most powerful Mac laptops, which cost more than $2,500.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a big deal that this week Apple announced thebeginning of the Mac\u2019s transition to Apple-made silicon, which will be based on the same chip architecture powering iPhones and iPads. If all goes well, we can expect Macs with snappier performance and much longer battery life, and they should also be able to run iPhone and iPad apps.\nThe transition to Apple chips is expected to take two years. If you buy a Mac in 2022, it should have the horsepower of an iPad, but work with a mouse and keyboard.\nThe Apple Watch is trying to be more helpful during the pandemic.Apple said the next version of the Apple Watch operating system, WatchOS 7, would take advantage of the watch\u2019s motion sensors to detect when you are washing your hands \u2014 and start a 20-second timer to ensure you scrub thoroughly. The watch will also use its sensors to track sleep patterns. These are relatively minor new features, but we could all probably use better sleep and hygiene these days.\nThanks to Brian for tag-teaming with me. This is Shira Ovide for the rest of today\u2019s dispatch.\nThe last few months have been A LOT. As the stresses on our bodies, finances, families and minds have piled up, it\u2019s gotten more complicated to seek help as physicians and mental health specialists paused seeing patients in person because of coronavirus fears.\nBut a silver lining, said Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a psychologist and founder of the mental health resourceTherapy for Black Girls, is that moving therapy sessions online has been more rewarding for some people \u2014 although that hasn\u2019t been true for everyone.\nFor some, taking face-to-face interaction out of therapy makes difficult conversations easier. \u201cAdding a screen is just enough of a barrier where it maybe feels safer to share something,\u201d Dr. Bradford said.\nDr. Bradford had advice for people seeking therapy right now through online appointments. During virtual sessions, try to find a private, personal space \u2014 even if that means taking a video call alone in your car, while on a walk or in the bathroom with the door closed.\nShe also advised people to give themselves a time to transition after sessions end, rather than jumping right back into family or work obligations.\nDr. Bradford also said people shouldn\u2019t be afraid to find a new therapist if their current one isn\u2019t a good match, for example a practitioner who isn\u2019t responsive to the added stresses that some black people are feeling.\nFor people worried about costs, Dr. Bradford said some individual therapists and apps such as Talkspace offer free appointments, and a number of health insurers have been waiving co-payments for people to speak to therapists virtually during the coronavirus.\nAnd nonprofit groups including the Loveland Foundation, Open Path Psychotherapy Collective and the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation offer financial assistance or lower-cost options for people who are seeking therapy.\nNever waste a crisis, I guess?Companies are repurposing their technology products asuntested and sometimes comical-sounding coronavirus-fighting systems. My colleaguesNatasha SingerandJulie Creswellwrite about software for tracking product inventory that has been remade into an employee virus-tracking system. Income verification software has been pitched for workers to report their health status to employers.\nI want to know everything about K-pop fans:TheNew York Times pop music writerJoe Coscarelliexplains the internet might of Korean pop music fans, who often use their online savvy to support their favorite boy bands and now aretaking credit for helping inflate attendance expectationsfor President Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally.\nAlso, read the Times Opinion writerCharlie Warzelfretting aboutoversimplifying young people\u2019s motivationsin the online information wars.\nYour regular reminder to be cautious of what you see and share online:A Times team found 41 U.S. cities and towns where false rumors spread about anti-fascist activists coming to cause mayhem.Davey Albaand Ben Decker traced the origins of how friends, neighbors and trusted businesses in four townssometimes unwittingly spread bogus fearsand forced law enforcement to respond.\nRescued baby swans!

        "title": "Tech Goliaths Act Like Davids",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nThe American technology industry was built on the white hot rage of underdogs.\nWhen Apple was founded, it mocked IBM as a bully that made terrible computers. Pipsqueak Google made Microsoftits mortal enemy. The young Uberhated \u2026 everyone, basically. It\u2019s energizing to be the scrappy upstart fighting a rich superpower or the big, bad system.\nThe technology companies still like to believe that they\u2019re Davids \u2014 except many of them are now Goliaths. And the underdog tactics and fighting spirit that once served them well now make these companies look petty and mean.\nAllow me to point you in the direction of lawsuits that Amazon hasrepeatedly filedagainst employees who leave its cloud-computing business for other jobs.\nThe most recent lawsuit said that a former marketing employee who was hired at Google possesses valuable Amazon secrets, in part because he wrote marketing speeches and made presentation slides. Look at thisincredibly revealing Amazon secret, for example. (Amazon has said that it\u2019s enforcing clauses in contracts that limit what its employees can do after they leave.)\nGoogle is big enough that it can presumably wait this lawsuit out. But how many other Amazon employees or potential employers are willing to risk the stress and uncertainty of possible litigation?\nThen there\u2019s Apple, which continues tobutt heads with app makersincluding Spotify and most recentlythe email service Hey. (TheHey dramacontinuedMonday morning.) These feuds are over money. Apple \u2014 with some justification \u2014 wants a share of the revenue that app companies earn when they sell to you and me in Apple\u2019s App Store. The app companies want to keep all of it.\nFinancial disagreements are common, but Apple can sound defensive and aggrieved in these cases. It created its rule book for app developers more than a decade ago, and Apple doesn\u2019t get why these companies are complaining.\nApple and the app makers now live on different planets. In 2008, the year Apple started the iPhone app storefront, the company had nearly $33 billion in sales. Last year it had $260 billion. Apple mans the gate to hundreds of millions of iPhones. When you\u2019re that big, every business disagreement is lopsided. (Kara Swisher, a contributing Opinion writer for The New York Times,made a similar pointin her column last week.)\nIt seems as if everywhere you look, former tech upstarts are turning the tables on today\u2019s youngsters. Facebook madeobvious copiesof Snap\u2019s Bitmojipersonalized cartoon characters. Facebook and Google are pitching hardtheir own alternativesto the suddenly popular Zoom video service. Copying smaller companies is not a great look.\nNone of these giants is necessarily doing anything wrong or unusual when they emulate, sue or pick fights with people and companies with less power.\nIt\u2019s cool to be a rebel with a cause. It\u2019s uncool (and unsympathetic) to be a rich and powerful giant. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has repeatedly said that he still views Apple as apretty small company. (Insert my booming laughter.)\nApple, Google, Amazon and Facebook areScrooge McDucksswimming in vaults of gold, but they like to act as if they\u2019re still ragamuffins taking on The Man. They\u2019re not. They are The Man.\nTip of the week\nBrian X. Chen, our personal tech columnist, gives us advice on using our smartphone to record a phone call and writes this issue\u2019s \u201cBefore we go\u201d section.\nMany people view recording phone calls as creepy and invasive \u2014 and in certain states, it is illegal unless all parties consent to being recorded.\nBut there are legitimate purposes, like keeping a record of important business conversations or documenting calls made to customer service representatives. I, for one, record phone interviews with important tech executives \u2014 only after getting permission from everyone involved.\nMany iPhone apps offer the ability to record calls. Android users, unfortunately, will have a tougher time: Google added restrictions that made it difficult and impractical to record calls.\nHere\u2019s what you can do:\nOn iPhones, the free appRev Call Recorderworks well. First, you place a phone call to Rev\u2019s recording service. Then you start another call with someone \u2014 or wait for a call to come in \u2014 and merge the calls to begin recording. After you hang up, the app stores a recording of the conversation on your device. There is also an option to pay for the recording to be transcribed.\n(The privacy-conscious may want to avoid using the app to record and transcribe sensitive calls \u2014 thecompany says customer files are encrypted, butemployees review the recordingswhen transcriptions are requested.)\nCall recording is trickier for Androids.Google\u2019s website has instructionson how to set up the Google Voice app to let you record incoming calls, but the feature doesn\u2019t work for outgoing calls. There are third-party apps for call recording, but generally they don\u2019t work well because of limits put in place by Google. Android users are not totally out of luck: Google appears to have acall recorderfor its phone app in the works.\nFarewell, Intel.In a virtual announcement on Monday, Apple is expected to outline its plan to replace the Intel microprocessors used in Mac computers with chips it designed itself. Starting next year, the company may ship Macs with chips based on Arm, the same semiconductor architecture used in iPhones and iPads. My colleagues explainwhy Apple is making this shift after 15 years of relying on Intel chips\u2014 and what this means for Intel.\nDid Trump get pranked by teenagers?The Trump campaign was anticipating huge crowds to attend a rally in Tulsa, Okla., over the weekend, but the turnout wasfar from that. My colleagues investigated the possibility thatTikTok users and fans of Korean pop music groups orchestrated an elaborate prankthat involved inflating ticket registrations. The Trump campaign has blamed the disappointing turnout onprotests and the coronavirus.\nSnap is sorry (sort of) about Juneteenth.In observation of Juneteenth, Snapchat on Friday released a filter inviting users to \u201csmile and break chains.\u201d Smiling in front of the camera triggered an animation of chains to break in the background. Critics immediately panned the filter, calling it tone deaf, andSnap apologizedfor offending people. But The Verge reported that in an internal email, the company appeared topush back on accusations of cultural insensitivity, explaining that the creation of the filter was a collaboration between black and white employees.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "A Four-Point Plan for Fixing the Economy",
        "fulltext": "Want this in your inbox each morning?Sign up here.\nIn many ways, the economic recovery from the coronavirus has defied the worst-case scenarios. Jobs, spending and markets have bounced back more quickly than expected, although they largely remain below pre-pandemic levels. This is mostly thanks to unprecedented government intervention, but many of those stimulus programs are set to expire soon. Then what?\nA heavyweight group of economists and former policymakers has a plan.Under the banner of the Aspen Institute\u2019s Economic Strategy Group, the four-member team haspublished a meaty reportoutlining a flexible approach to supporting the recovery, tied to the strength of the rebound and not to any specific date. (High-level details are in thisWashington Post op-ed.)\n\u2022 The group behind the plan:Jason Furmanof Harvard, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama;Timothy Geithnerof Warburg Pincus, who was Treasury secretary during the Obama administration;Glenn Hubbardof Columbia University, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush; andMelissa Kearneyof the University of Maryland, the director of the Economic Strategy Group.\nTheir proposal has four parts:\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Income support for the unemployed.Provide a weekly benefit of up to 40 percent of wages for the jobless as long as a state\u2019s unemployment rate is above 15 percent, phased out until the rate hits 7 percent, when it is eliminated.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3Additional incentives to return to work.Subsidize lower-wage jobs, which become less attractive when enhanced unemployment benefits are on offer and many of the roles are at higher risk of exposure to the coronavirus. Incentives could include a more generous Earned Income Tax Credit or direct hiring bonuses.\n3\ufe0f\u20e3Lending to small and midsize businesses.A \u201cmuch more aggressive use\u201d of the funds already allocated by Congress to support loans \u2014 not grants \u2014 to target viable businesses, at better rates, understanding that the government could face more potential losses.\n4\ufe0f\u20e3Support the states.Issue grants for general use (and especially education), along with federal funding for Medicaid tied to the unemployment rate.\nIt won\u2019t be cheap.At best, the group reckons that its plan would cost just under $1 trillion. If the recovery drags on, it could cost something like $2 trillion. \u201cRather than misleading or pretending the recovery will be cheaper, for example by covering only a few months of unemployment insurance or only a fraction of the ultimate cost of the Paycheck Protection Plan,\u201d the group writes, \u201cwe believe it is better to be upfront about what the total costs will ultimately be and legislate them today in a contingent fashion that depends on economic circumstances.\u201d\nIn other news on recovery and reopening:\nA virus surge in Sun Belt states.Arizona, Florida and Texas reported theirlargest one-day increasesin Covid-19 cases yet. And it\u2019s not just because of more testing: The rate of positive test results is also rising. But Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said, \u201cWe\u2019re not shutting down.\u201d\nBeijing goes back into lockdown.A rise in cases led to theclosing of schoolsandcancellation of flightsto the capital, as authorities raised the coronavirus threat level just 10 days after lowering it, which had allowed more economic activity to resume.\nPrepare for negative interest rates in the U.S., Bloombergadvised users of its data terminals. The company recommended that subscribers ensure their financial models wouldn\u2019t break, Y2K-style, if the Fed pushes rates below zero. The central bank says it won\u2019t ... but experience suggests that it\u2019s best to be prepared.\nProtests over racial injustice following the killing of George Floyd first prompted companies and their leaders to pledge support for combating racism. Now, Business Roundtable, which represents American blue-chip companies, is speaking out on policing policies.\nBusiness Roundtable urged changes,saying in a statementthat \u201camong the most urgent challenges is the need to protect our citizens and address unwarranted, excessive and even lethal force, especially against unarmed black men and women.\u201d\nThe call to action shows Corporate America responding to the public conversation on race, specifically the debate over the\u201cdefund the police\u201dmovement. National polls show growing support for overhauling law enforcement.\nBut the group didn\u2019t suggest specific changes, instead saying that lawmakers should \u201ccome together and seize the opportunity for real solutions,\u201d with its members promising to support \u201csignificant reforms.\u201d\nIn other news on social inequality:\nMorgan Stanley\u2019s former diversity chief sued the firm,allegingthat she was fired in December after pushing a plan to diversify the bank\u2019s ranks of financial advisers. The firm denies the allegations.\nBlack founders face a litany of humiliations in Silicon Valley,Bloomberg reportsafter speaking with 20 leaders. Among them: others mistaking their white deputies as the C.E.O. of their companies, and visible discomfort on the part of white venture capitalists in business pitch meetings.\nTransgender people worry they are falling behind during the coronavirus recession,The Times reports. They were already facing adversity, with transgender people of color six times more likely than the national average to be unemployed. With Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, already warning thatthe pandemic will widen inequality, there\u2019s concern that things will only get worse.\nThe iPhone maker is the latest tech giant to face scrutiny over its competitive practices, as start-ups and regulators say that the Silicon Valley giant hasn\u2019t been playing fair.\nThe latest controversy is over an email app.Basecamp had submitted an update for Hey, a new email service already approved by Apple, for review by the company\u2019s App Store team. But Apple rejected the app because Hey didn\u2019t accept subscriptions in its app \u2014 which would have let Apple take a cut,Protocol reports.\n\u2022 The revelation came after the E.U. began investigating the App Store forpotential antitrust violations, an inquiry stemming from complaints by Spotify.\nOthers are now piling on.Match Group, the parent company of the dating service Tinder, criticized Apple\u2019s demands for a cut of apps\u2019 revenue.It told Axiosin a statement that \u201cApple squeezes industries like e-books, music and video streaming, cloud storage, gaming and online dating for 30% of their revenue, which is all the more alarming when Apple then enters that space, as we\u2019ve repeatedly seen.\u201d\nPG&E pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter.Therare acknowledgment of corporate wrongdoing, which also came with a $3.5 million fine, came at the end of a two-year trial over the utility\u2019s role in the deadly fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, Calif. in 2018.\nA common steroid appears to help severely ill coronavirus patients.Dexamethasone reduced deaths in patients with severe cases of Covid-19,according to a studyof 2,100 patients by the University of Oxford.\nSome lawmakers benefited directly from small-business rescue loans.At least four members of Congresshave family ties to firms that received funds, which is allowed by the program but nonetheless awkward as lawmakers fight over the Treasury Department\u2019s refusal to release information about recipients of the loans.\nRetail sales blew past expectations last month, risingnearly 18 percentfrom April, more than doubling the average economist forecast. Maybe there will be a V-shaped recovery after all?\nNot so fast.Aswe\u2019ve discussed before, the severity of the pandemic\u2019s shock has made most economic data \u2014 to use a technical term \u2014 go bananas. The month-to-month jump in May sales was the largest on record, but that was because it came after a lockdown-induced plunge in April; it was still 6 percent lower than the same month last year. Few expect sales to match pre-pandemic levels for some time, even if shorter-term growth looks robust.\nUncovering details in the data.Home renovations have become a popular pandemic pastime: Sales of building materials and garden supplies were up 16 percent in May versus the year before, one of the few categories doingbetterafter the outbreak. But clothing sales have collapsed, down more than 60 percent from last year. There\u2019s a joke to be made about naked gardening, but we\u2019ve learned that, in fact,World Naked Gardening Dayhas been held on the first Saturday in May for the past 15 years. Did economists fail to factor that into their models?\nDeals\n\u2022 The stock market\u2019s sudden recovery has start-ups scrambling to revive I.P.O. plans. (NYT)\n\u2022 SoftBank reportedly plans to sell up to two-thirds of its stake in T-Mobile, which is valued at about $20 billion. (CNBC)\n\u2022 Companies are asking lenders and bondholders to substitute their profits last year for this year\u2019s \u2014 basically, to \u201cpretend the coronavirus hasn\u2019t happened\u201d \u2014 to avoid breaching debt covenants. (FT)\nPolitics and policy\n\u2022 The Trump administration sued John Bolton, the former national security adviser, an attempt to delay publication of his tell-all memoir. (NYT)\n\u2022 Should lawmakers stop trading stocks to avoid accusations of insider trading? (NYT)\nTech\n\u2022 Facebook will let American usersopt out of seeing political ads, though it won\u2019t take action against ads with misleading information. The company is also trying toregister four million new voters. (NYT, Recode)\n\u2022 Google banned ZeroHedge from its ad platform over policy violations in the user comments on stories about Black Lives Matter protests. (NBC News)\nBest of the rest\n\u2022 Reed Hastings of Netflix is reportedly buildinga 2,100-acre luxury training retreatin Colorado for teachers. Meanwhile, WeWork is in talks with New York City private schools aboutholding classes in its co-working spaces. (Recode, CNBC)\n\u2022 California name regulations forced Elon Musk and Grimes to rename their baby: Goodbye X \u00c6 A-12 Musk, hello X AE A-XII Musk. (TMZ)\nWe\u2019d love your feedback.
