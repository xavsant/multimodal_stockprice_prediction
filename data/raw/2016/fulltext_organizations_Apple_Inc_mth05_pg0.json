        "title": "Rethinking Apple\u2019s Recipe for Success",
        "fulltext": "For Apple, saying \u201cno\u201d may be getting harder.\nEddy Cue, an executive in charge of iTunes and Internet services for the technology giant, raised the possibility of a bid for Time Warner at a meeting with the media conglomerate last year, according to The Financial Times. That seems at odds with the recipe for success championed by Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s founder: Reject \u201c1,000 ideas\u201d and focus on only the few excellent ones. An aging iPhone, a tepid stock price and a pile of idle cash, however, could make even a mediocre idea look awfully tempting.\nThe deal talk never went beyond a preliminary stage or involved Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook. Making more movies, television shows and other content available on, say, iPads might help strengthen the device\u2019s popularity and sales. It\u2019s unclear, though, why owning content \u2013 not to mention acquiring it by paying perhaps $75 billion for Time Warner, including a control premium \u2013 would make more sense than just agreeing to distribute it. Apple\u2019s resources are better spent creating compelling devices, not trying to develop a sequel to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d\nThe company has been phenomenally successful sticking to Mr. Jobs\u2019s mantra of minimalism. There is growing pressure, though, for something new.\nProducing beautiful cutting-edge technology is, in some cases, turning into a business of churning out commodities. About 1.4 billion smartphones were sold worldwide last year, so it\u2019s harder to find new customers willing to spend hundreds of dollars extra for an iPhone, no matter how elegant its design. Investors seem to recognize that. Apple\u2019s stock trades at a roughly 30 percent discount to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\nThe company\u2019s financial strength also feeds an urge for change. Its net cash exceeds $150 billion, and its free cash flow should easily surpass $50 billion this year. That makes almost any acquisition easier to rationalize.\nApple is well known for resisting any impulse to splurge on second-rate ideas. It\u2019s tough to imagine one of its top executives even discussing the purchase of a tangentially related company like Time Warner. Yet the news about Mr. Cue suggests a shift. Apple\u2019s best hope may be that Mr. Cook stands firm on his predecessor\u2019s sage advice."

        "fulltext": "Last month, Shelby Bonnie\u2019s iPad vanished from his carry-on bag somewhere at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport after a red-eye flight from San Francisco. He figured he would never see it again.\nBut sometimes our devices aren\u2019t ready to say goodbye.\nWhile Mr. Bonnie, an investment banker with Allen & Company, continued on his way to the Bahamas for a few days of relaxation, his iPad began a strange odyssey of its own, turning Mr. Bonnie into a digital gumshoe and the narrator of a personal thriller that played out on Facebook, to the delight of his online friends.\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m definitely going to lose my iPad, but I\u2019m going to have some fun,\u2019\u201d Mr. Bonnie said in a phone interview.\nThe reason the iPad\u2019s story didn\u2019t end with its disappearance is a location tracking feature on Apple devices calledFind My iPhone, which can be used to pinpoint any lost or stolen Apple device, including iPads and Macs.\nOthers have used this capability tovery publicly hunt downmissing devices before, including David Pogue, a former technology reviewer for The New York Times who broadcast the hunt for his missing iPhone in Maryland to his Twitter followers. He eventually recovered the device with the help of the local police.\nWhen Mr. Bonnie discovered the iPad was missing after he left the Fort Lauderdale airport, he turned on Find My iPhone and saw that his tablet was at Elvis Presley\u2019s Heartbreak Hotel at Graceland \u2014 in Memphis. The app represented the location of the device as a glowing green circle on an aerial map outside the hotel, with its distinctive heart-shaped pool.\nHis best guess was that he had lost the iPad in the airport when he was stuffing a travel pillow back into his carry-on bag and that the device was now in the company of another traveler who had picked it up.\nThat person had apparently decided not to turn in the device to the lost-and-found department at the airport. Through Find My iPhone, Mr. Bonnie sent a message, visible on the lock screen of the iPad, telling whoever had the device to call his cellphone for a reward. No one did.\nOver the next few days, Mr. Bonnie began providing regular updates on the iPad\u2019s whereabouts to his friends on Facebook, providing screen shots from Find My iPhone that showed the device headed to downtown Memphis and at the Links at Riverside, a golf course. \u201cIPad is on the move,\u201d one of his updates said.\nMost of his posts got more than 100 likes on Facebook and dozens of comments, as Mr. Bonnie\u2019s online acquaintances became more engaged in the story.\n\u201cPlease keep your fans informed as to the results of the mystery,\u201d one commenter said.\nBy coincidence, Mr. Bonnie nearly bumped into his iPad on a short layover from the Bahamas. As he waited at Concourse C at the Fort Lauderdale airport for a flight back to his home in San Francisco, he saw on Find My iPhone that his iPad was on an airplane approaching Concourse C.\nHe quickly located the gate for an Allegiant Air flight arriving from Memphis and looked over the passengers disembarking from the plane.\nHe remembered he could use Find My iPhone to trigger a distress signal on his iPad. He activated the feature, but heard no sound. He told his Facebook fans he was within 100 feet of the iPad.\n\u201cThis is better than \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d one commented.\nHe concluded that the iPad must have been inside checked luggage that never entered the terminal. By the time he got to the correct baggage carousel the iPad had left the airport.\n\u201cAt some point it became more about the storytelling and less about the iPad,\u201d said Mr. Bonnie, a co-founder of the technology news and reviews siteCNET. \u201cEverybody loves a good story. It\u2019s more entertaining than getting the iPad back.\u201d\nMr. Bonnie saw an opportunity for mischief when the iPad finally seemed to stay put in a residential neighborhood in Miami Lakes, a suburb of Miami. On a map, it looked like a nice home with a swimming pool, Mr. Bonnie said.\nHe boarded his plane to San Francisco, ordered in-flight Wi-Fi access and spent $50 to have five Mylar balloons delivered to the house the next morning. On the card, he listed the occasion as \u201cThinking of You.\u201d\n\u201cFriendly yet slightly creepy enough for them to want that iPad out of their house,\u201d one of his Facebook friends said.\nA voice mail message left by a reporter for the phone number associated with the Miami Lakes address was not returned.\nThe balloons appeared to have an effect. The next morning the iPad was on the move again \u2014 back to the Fort Lauderdale airport. Mr. Bonnie, in San Francisco, was watching the device traveling on the map when it occurred to him that whoever had it might be taking it to the airport\u2019s lost and found.\nHe went to the airport\u2019s website and began filling out a missing item claim form when his phone rang. It was someone from lost and found.\n\u201cAs described by lost and found when they called a second ago, a fairly elderly woman came in a few minutes ago and said she had gotten the balloons and thought it would be a good idea to return the iPad to the airport,\u201d Mr. Bonnie wrote in a Facebook post. \u201cShe said to thank me for the balloons, but she didn\u2019t really want to call.\u201d\n\u201cBetter than \u2018Serial,\u2019\u201d a friend commented on Facebook. \u201cBetter than \u2018This American Life.\u2019 Better than everything.\u201d\nMr. Bonnie paid to have his iPad shipped home by UPS. He received it in San Francisco on Friday. He hung a banner saying \u201cWelcome Home\u201d on his front door."

You are being replaced by a tree-filled Genius Grove, which will have more room to sit and more Apple customer service specialists to troubleshoot devices.\nOn Thursday, the15th anniversary of the first Apple retail store, the technology companyunveiledwhat it called its largest product: a new design for its sales outlets.\nApple\u2019s 477 physical stores are showrooms for the Apple lifestyle, not just places to buy the latest iPhones, iPads, Macs and accessories.

An open space that Apple calls the forum provides room for presentations as well as small classes on various topics.\nAnd then there are the trees.

        "fulltext": "Apple is running out of parking spaces. If you drop by its Infinite Loop headquarters, you will find the place stretched beyond capacity. Even the valets, who double and triple-park the Teslas and Porsches that now flock to the world\u2019s most valuable company, have given up finding free spots.\nPeople at Apple speak longingly of the company\u2019s new campus, Steve Jobs\u2019s $5 billion circular glass dream, which isscheduled to open next year. The Spaceship, as it is called, is almost ready. Soon Apple will slip the surly bonds of Earth, the strictures of time and space and be ready for launch.\nThat was the plan, anyway. But in the last few months, after more than a decade of unprecedented growth, history was interrupted. Apple\u2019slasttwoearnings reportsshowed that it had finally hit a peak. Though Apple\u2019s profits remain the envy of the corporate world, a naysaying pessimism now surrounds everything it does.\nThree months ago, I said this view was too gloomy. Given the size of its customer base and the unlikely prospect of iPhone lovers switching to Android, Apple\u2019s short-term future looked O.K. \u201cNo need to fret, Apple is doing fine,\u201d I wrote.\nThat is still true. Several analysts project that over the next year, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales will return to slow growth rather than decline, which should keep its bottom line at its current stratospheric level.\nBut you don\u2019t build spaceship-shaped corporate monuments on the prospect of doing just fine. The deeper question is whether Apple can keep its place as the North Star of the tech firmament. Can the company build the next great platform in computing, as it did the last one? Are its best days ahead of it, as Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, insists \u2014 or is the new campus the capstone of an era of Apple dominance that we will never see again?\nI will offer a suggestion. To thrive in the next era of tech, Apple needs to take a series of bigger, bolder risks.\nApple\u2019s last decade and a half, mostly under Mr. Jobs, has been defined by perfectionist focus. As its executives and marketing videos repeatedly boast, Applesays no to a thousand ideas before it says yes to one. That attitude was perfectly suited to a particular era in tech \u2014 the rise of mobile devices, which were the ultimate expression of Apple\u2019s expertise in creating jewel-like hardware.\nBut the next moment in tech is likely to be dominated by data-driven online services \u2014 more products like Siri and Apple Pay, fewer stand-alone hardware innovations like the iPhone.\nIn that environment, the slow search for precision and perfection might no longer be in Apple\u2019s best interest. Mr. Cook\u2019s goal, now, should be to alter Apple\u2019s governing ethos to induce a small measure of chaos into his company.\nIt is likely that Apple is already working on some bold plans in secret (a car and a pay TV service are among several that have long been reported). The shift I\u2019m calling for would not be radical, just evolutionary. It should be more nimble and slightly more public with its experiments, and push more of them out sooner. When it releases stuff, it should move faster to fix and improve what is wrong. Above all, it should take more risks; it should say yes more often.\nThese changes will be difficult because they could upset Apple\u2019s customer base and its brand. Experimenting more means failing more, usually in public. Failing means looking bad, and looking bad isn\u2019t something Apple does well.\nThe news media is especially unkind to perceptions of \u201cfailure\u201d from Apple. When Apple\u2019s Maps apps had flaws, it was considered headline news. (Never mind that Apple Maps is now muchmore popular than Google Mapswith iPhone users.) The Apple Watchsold more units in its first year than the iPhone did\u2014 but because the watch was far from perfect, and it hasn\u2019t yet become a must-have new gadget, it\u2019swidely deridedas a whiff.\nStill, for Apple, a more freewheeling attitude, one that pushes it to put out more experimental products, could be worth the risk.We\u2019re in an odd time intech. There are lots of new technologies pegged as potential next big things \u2014 artificial intelligence, virtual reality, drones, wearables, the Internet of Things \u2014 but figuring out how all these pieces should fit together to create experiences people love necessarily involves experimentation.\nIn this environment, the best new products are not likely to be obvious. They will most likely be ridiculed at first and they may actually be kind of useless in early versions. But over time, with brainstorming and updates based on consumer feedback, you might discover something precious.\nA good example here is the Amazon Echo, the voice-recognizing household computer that has morphed from an odd gimmick into auseful and groundbreaking exampleof the future of computing. And it seems no accident that the Echo \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s successful cloud business and its Prime subscription service, both unlikely ideas \u2014 were birthed from a company whose chief executive has embraced risk and failure as a signal measure of corporate health.\n\u201cI believe we are the best place in the world to fail (we have plenty of practice!), and failure and invention are inseparable twins,\u201d that chief executive, Jeff Bezos, wrote ina recent letter to shareholders. He added: \u201cMost large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there.\u201d\nApple has accumulated many of the pieces to create technologies of the future. It has expertise in voice recognition, data mining, wearables, and of course, hardware and software design. Most importantly, it also has a huge installed base of users who willingly try its newest products.\nWhat it doesn\u2019t have quite yet is enough of an appetite for the speed and risks that come with creating and maintaining new services. Some of its sins here have been unforgivable. Siri was one of the earliest voice-recognition technologies released to the public. It wasn\u2019t perfect when it came out and Apple has made slow improvements over time. Today\u2019s Siri is vastly more powerful than yesterday\u2019s.\nBut it still feels like a missed opportunity. There is so much Siri should be able to do that it cannot. Why can\u2019t Siri plug into more parts of my phone? Why can\u2019t it tap into the Uber app to call a car for me, or start up HBO Now when I say, \u201cHey, show me last week\u2019s \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019?\u201d\nBen Thompson, who writes at the site Stratechery, recently cited a similar litany of shortcomings in Apple\u2019s services \u2014 among them the App Store, iMessage, Apple Pay and Apple Music.Mr. Thompson saidthat Apple\u2019s unusual functional organizational structure \u2014 in which executives are in charge of certain business functions, like engineering or marketing, and not product lines \u2014 worked better for creating hardware products than compelling online services.\nI\u2019m not sure I quite buy Mr. Thompson\u2019s thesis about the cause of some of Apple\u2019s mistakes in its online services. It is not clear that Apple needs a wholesale restructuring rather than simply a greater push from Mr. Cook to be bolder in these products.\nIt is important to note, too, that Apple has very patient customers and that the overall value of its ecosystem often makes up for particular deficits in some of its services. Consider Apple Music, a subscription music service that offered no great improvements over competing services like Spotify. Yet despite being late to market and not as pleasant to use as rivals, Apple Music has snapped up 13 million subscribers paying $120 a year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already become a $2 billion business, and it did not exist last year,\u201d said Kulbinder Garcha, an analyst at Credit Suisse who has said that Apple can realize significant growth in its profits by creating and improving online services. If Apple moves quickly to fix some of the problems with Apple Music \u2014 cleaning up its user interface, adding handy features like Spotify\u2019s in-app lyrics browser \u2014 it could easily build on that early growth.\n\u201cThese things don\u2019t have to be a hit from day one, but what\u2019s important is that they keep learning from their mistakes and keep updating them,\u201d Mr. Garcha said. In other words, Be faster, take more risks, go bold."

        "title": "Podcasts Surge, but Producers Fear Apple Isn\u2019t Listening",
        "fulltext": "Steven P. Jobs put his talent as a master salesman to the test when, in 2005, he introduced new Apple software for downloading digital audio shows. The format was so incipient that he struggled to describe it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like TiVo, for radio, for your iPod,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the \u2018Wayne\u2019s World\u2019 of radio, but real radio is jumping onto this.\u201d\nBut he was clear about the potential. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very, very exciting,\u201d he said.\nHe was talking about podcasting \u2014 radio-style shows made for the Internet that have, in recent years, exploded in popularity. These days, many amateur podcasters are going professional. Major media organizations, searching for answers and bright spots in a fast-changing and confusing digital world, are releasing new shows every week. Advertisers are starting to follow them, and so are millions of dollars of venture capital.\nIt is, in other words, an industry now, one that Apple essentially gave life to and still dominates. Yet at this moment of triumph for podcasting, concerns are growing in the community about how much Apple actually cares.\nInterviews with over two dozen podcasters and people inside Apple reveal a variety of complaints. The podcasters say that they are relegated to wooing a single Apple employee for the best promotion. That sharing on social media is cumbersome. And that for podcasters to make money, they need more information about their listeners, and Apple is in a unique position to provide it. The problems, they say, could even open up an opportunity for a competitor.\n\u201cThe lack of podcast data is kind of shocking,\u201d said Gina Delvac, the producer of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend,\u201d a popular show about pop culture and politics.\nLate last month, Apple brought seven leading podcast professionals to the company\u2019s campus in Cupertino, Calif., to air their case to a room full of employees, according to two people who were there. The people would speak only on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. The company made no promises, the people said, but several pressing issues for podcasters were discussed in frank terms.\nAfter the presentations concluded, Eddy Cue, the executive at Apple who oversees software and services, arrived for a closed session with the company\u2019s employees, according to the attendees.\n\u201cI think everyone who\u2019s seriously involved in this space, they\u2019d at least like to know what the endgame is,\u201d said Chris Morrow, the chief executive of the Loud Speakers Podcast Network. \u201cPeople think there\u2019s another shoe that\u2019s going to drop.\u201d\nPodcasting had been growing swiftly for years, but in 2014, \u201cSerial,\u201d a show that in its first season re-examined a murder case,was the first breakout hit. The season barreled into pop culture, attracting 110 million downloads.\nBy last year, at least 46 million Americans listened to podcasts each month. This year, that numberwill reach 57 million, according to a survey by Edison Research.\nBut podcasting is a product of a different era for digital media \u2014 and for Apple. When Mr. Jobs introduced the updated podcast software in 2005, the company was still in comeback mode, driven by iPods. The iPhone wouldn\u2019t come out for two more years.\nNow Apple is the biggest public company in the world, but podcasts bring Apple virtually nothing in direct revenue. Perhaps as a result, the iTunes podcasting hub that Mr. Jobs introduced remains strikingly unchanged. Sharing on social media, which basically didn\u2019t exist in 2005, takes multiple clicks.\nPromotion within iTunes, which is still one of the only reliable ways to build an audience, particularly for a new show, is decided by a small team that fields pitches and does its own outreach. Interviews with people inside and outside the company make it clear that Apple\u2019s small podcast team has been hearing \u2014 and assuaging \u2014 such concerns for years.\nThe question for podcasters \u2014 and for Apple \u2014 is about what comes next. Apple has at least two obvious choices: to rush to accommodate an industry that is quickly outgrowing its origins, or to let podcasting be, at the risk of losing its claim over a medium that owes its very name to the company.\nEven podcasters are conflicted; a hands-off Apple retains some appeal. \u201cSome would argue that it could have advanced in certain ways,\u201d said Andy Bowers, chief content officer of Slate\u2019s Panoply podcast network. But since 2005, he said, \u201cthey\u2019ve provided a remarkably level playing field.\u201d\nIn a statement, Mr. Cue of Apple said, \u201cWe have more people than ever focused on podcasting, including engineers, editors and programmers.\u201d He added, \u201cPodcasts hold a special place with us at Apple.\u201d\nIn terms of revenue, podcasting is still minuscule compared with the technology and entertainment industries. In the early days, hobbyists grew passion projects into businesses and full-time jobs. Now a few established podcast networks and popular podcasters have millions in revenue.\nPodcasters can sell advertisements at rates ranging from $20 to $100 for every thousand listeners. For podcasts with hundreds of thousands of listeners \u2014 and, in rare cases, millions \u2014 those numbers add up. The spending on advertisements will generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the industry this year, said Matt Lieber, a co-founder of Gimlet Media, a podcasting start-up that has raised $7.5 million from venture capitalists.\nExpanding the industry much more, though, gets tricky. Apple does not allow shows to charge people to download episodes, for example, and does not support paid subscriptions, as many podcasters would like. Apple has stuck with an advertising model for podcasting that looks almost exactly like what Mr. Jobs predicted onstage in 2005.\nMeasuring how many people listen is also inconsistent and a regular source of frustration. Podcasters know how many times their podcasts are downloaded, for example, but they don\u2019t know how many people actually listened, or how far those listeners might have gotten.\nWith data like listener counts and listening duration \u2014 similar to what Apple provides app developers \u2014 the industry could accelerate quickly, said Ms. Delvac of \u201cCall Your Girlfriend.\u201d\nBut unlike with downloads of music, movies and apps \u2014 sources of billions of dollars of revenue for Apple, which takes a cut from sales and subscriptions \u2014 the company\u2019s financial incentive in podcasting is limited. The company takes no cut from podcast advertising, and all podcast downloads are free, so there is no cut to take from that, either. As it stands, podcasting is effectively just one more free feature to help the company sell hardware.\nAnd it\u2019s a popular one. Apple\u2019s service now contains over 325,000 podcasts. The company expects users to listen to 10 billion episodes in its apps \u2014 on computers, mobile devices and on Apple TV \u2014 by the end of the year.\n\u201cApple built this village 10 years ago,\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \u201cThere\u2019s really interesting things in the village, and interesting characters. But the village now has the population of a city \u2014 and when a village becomes a city, you need new infrastructure.\u201d\nApple\u2019s conservative approach may be creating an opportunity for competitors, as has happened before. Apple\u2019s iTunes software helped popularize online music, only to watch streaming services like Spotify and Pandora create compelling alternatives. Apple pressured the television and film industries to sell, and rent, their content online; then Netflix built subscription streaming into a business worth nearly $40 billion.\nGoogle abandoned a podcast app in 2012, but this year it added a podcast features to its music app, which is included with smartphones that run the company\u2019s Android operating system. Todd Cochrane, chief executive of RawVoice, a company that tracks podcasts, said Apple\u2019s share of podcast listeners is now about 65 percent, down from 70 percent a year ago. He attributed that change almost entirely to an \u201cupsurge\u201d in listening on Android.\nIn January, Spotify, the streaming music service, began rolling out an ambitious slate of podcasts. Among the company\u2019s promises to podcasters: hosting, streaming and extensive listening data. Audible, the audiobook service owned by the notoriously aggressive Amazon, is investing heavily in original audio content under the guidance of Eric Nuzum, a former vice president at National Public Radio. (The New York Times is among the partners working with Audible.)\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively distributing our content in many different places right now,\u201d said Laura Walker, president and chief executive of New York Public Radio, whose podcasts include \u201cRadiolab,\u201d \u201cFreakonomics\u201d and \u201c2 Dope Queens.\u201d \u201cEverything is growing.\u201d\nApple\u2019s stance as the giant of the industry remains undisputed, though, and podcasters are left to navigate a complicated relationship with the company. Most send messages to the company at a general email address. To those who have direct contact, their relationship centers on one person: Steve Wilson.\nMr. Wilson, podcasters say, acts as Apple\u2019s de facto podcast gatekeeper. Attention from him can be the difference between a hit and a dud \u2014 and between a podcast that pays and one that doesn\u2019t.\nThe most consistent major source of new listeners \u2014 in some cases, tens of thousands \u2014 is a top spot on iTunes and Apple\u2019s podcast app. That is the real estate that Mr. Wilson helps oversee, and that podcasters covet. (Mr. Wilson directed a request for an interview to a company publicist, who declined to make him available for an interview.)\n\u201cAs far as I can tell they\u2019re huge podcasts enthusiasts,\u201d said Jody Avirgan, who hosts and produces podcasts for the ESPN data journalism site FiveThirtyEight. \u201cBut you\u2019re trying to cram thousands of new shows into, what, six things that get featured on the home page?\u201d\nMr. Wilson\u2019s identity and contact information are shared among podcasters like a juicy secret, and his podcast preferences are furtively debated in the industry, as are those of his boss, James Boggs. Mostly, it makes podcasters wonder: At a company the size of Apple, what does it mean that American podcasters are left to lobby a single person?\nFrom Apple\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s not that simple. Of the more than 150 iTunes podcast portals around the world, 29 have hand-edited selections and Steve Wilsons of their own. Any change to the way Apple handles podcasting could have wide ramifications.\nAdditionally, the \u201cTop Podcast\u201d list within iTunes is also the subject of constant speculation among podcasters. An apparent change in the system this year resulted in small podcasts from Disney fans \u2014 and a show that hadn\u2019t yet published its first full episode \u2014 being ranked alongside shows with hundreds of thousands of listeners, according to Nicholas Quah, who publishes Hot Pod, a newsletter about the industry.\nFor listeners, quirks like this may only be a little weird. For podcasters, who already struggle to communicate their success to advertisers, it leaves them frustrated.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like the question everyone asks of any company,\u201d said Ms. Delvac, the \u201cCall Your Girlfriend\u201d producer. \u201cHow can I keep the good parts of my relationship the same, and get more of what I want?\u201d"

        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: The Technology We Love to Hate",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Good morning, Farhad! I\u2019m gearing up and researching my route to start delivering food for theTimes\u2019s new meal kit service. Can you help strap a few more foie gras packets to my back?\nFarhad:Mike, I know you\u2019re really passionate about getting traffic to your stories, but I\u2019ve warned you before \u2014 our readers do not want you showing up to their homes with food.\nMike:I\u2019m still trying to pitch my \u201ccook-and-eat mayonnaise sandwiches just like the ace reporter Mike Isaac\u201d marketing campaign. No response yet, but fingers crossed.\nAnyway, on with the show. Let\u2019s do a superquick rundown of the week in tech.\nThis week, you argue in your columnthat Apple should fail moreto ultimately win, a professional tactic that seems to have suited you quite well.\nAnd Google is teaming up with Fiat Chrysler to equip afleet of minivans with self-driving technology, making this the most dad-core rollout of autonomous vehicles in the history of Silicon Valley.\nFarhad:Finally, a tech company is thinking of fathers. I hope this sets off a trend. Maybe Spotify will offer a music subscription plan that plays only Billy Joel, Coldplay, U2 and Foo Fighters? Or maybe Twitter will roll out a feed of the best dad jokes? Oh, wait, never mind \u2014that already exists.\nMike:Thank you, resident dad. And lastly, a bunch of ex-journalists turned Facebook employees turned ex-Facebook employees leaked just how questionable Facebook\u2019s practices around selecting trending content seem to be, which was not a good look for Facebook. Gizmodo\u2019s scoop iswell worth the read.\nBut this week we wanted to try something new, right? Instead of a deep dive into one tech topic, we\u2019re going to do a short list, mostly because millennials love lists.\nFarhad:Yup, exactly. I know that we planned to do a list called \u201c14 Reasons Mike Looks Up to Farhad,\u201d but I actually worried we\u2019d run out of space. So I had another idea. We both encounter a lot of technology in our daily lives \u2014 for me during the course of reporting, for you to escape bounty hunters. So I was thinking that we could both list a couple of our most-hated products or services in tech. What gadget gets you really steamed, Mike?\nMike:My most-hated tech product has to be the popularization of the \u201crugged\u201d Bluetooth speaker designed to clip to one\u2019s belt loop, essentially a modern take on the boombox, but 10 times more obnoxious.\nIt\u2019s marketed as an outdoorsy-type thing, something to take to the beach, or camping or, in your case,glamping. \u201cImagine yourself scaling Mount Everest and listening to Sugar Ray at the peak!\u201d the ad copy (probably) goes. The tunes stream from your iPhone to the speaker, which sounds just as tinny and terrible as you would think.\nI never really saw them around on the street until I moved to San Francisco. Now I mostly see them on cyclist dudes, at least two of whom were smoking pot and blazing through stop signs, I kid you not. I\u2019m walking down the sidewalk and all of a sudden I\u2019m getting low-quality audio blared at me. It\u2019s like being accosted by a drive-by Sublime album.\nFarhad:I guess I agree, except when those dudes are blasting some sweet dad tunes. Like imagine if that guy was playing the Eagles? I\u2019d stop him, shake his hand, put my lighter in the air and wave my arms gently back and forth, marveling at the wonders of the universe.\nAnyway, you know what I hate? The iPhone charging cable. It\u2019s called Lightning, though a better name would be Fraying. I\u2019m lucky if I get six months out of these cables before they start acting up \u2014 usually the connector begins separating from the cable or you get a kink in the line that begins to crack, and soon your phone stops charging. I hate it. Will someone please make a superstrong charging cable, please?\nMike:I am totally with you there. I have a drawer full of cheap Chinese knock-off Lightning cables, and they all work for a day and then bust. If I buy the real $30 one from Apple, it still goes bad in less than a year. Forget the annual new iPhone events, I want the company to hold an ultimate, indestructible Lightning cable event.\nHere\u2019s something else that I wanted to like, but actually hate: streaming, stationary digital cameras like those offered by Nest for the home.\nI really liked the whole safety and security pitch at first. When I lived in New York, the editors unfortunately wanted me to leave my house and go into the office to work \u2014 something I\u2019m pretty sure you have never done in the San Francisco bureau. So setting up a Nest cam to watch my dog while I\u2019m gone seemed like a nice idea.\nInstead, I felt like a creepy voyeur. My dog sat and slept by the door, and watching her made me feel sad. Then when my dog walker \u2014 whom I trust and like \u2014 came in, I saw him pet my dog and be supersweet with her and do what I always assumed he did normally, which was walk my dog. But not telling him that I was watching him felt like a strange breach of trust, as if I suspected him of something that wasn\u2019t ever really warranted.\nIt made me realize how prevalent these cameras are now, and how violated I would feel were I being recorded in, say, my friends\u2019 homes. My \u201chatred,\u201d I guess, is that it\u2019s so mainstream and there\u2019s little I can do to stop it.\nBut at my house, at least, I let my dog have her privacy when I\u2019m gone. It\u2019s better that way.\nFarhad:Huh. You seem to be a much bigger hater than me.\nLet\u2019s see, what else do I hate? I hate most hashtags. I can see their value as part of a political campaign or meme \u2014 like, #oscarsowhite or #blacklivesmatter \u2014 but I hate when people add useless hashtags to their most banal posts. On Instagram, people will post photos of their trendy brunch and then clog it up with a barrage of idiotic hashtags: #brunch #sundayfun #sleepinglate #ihavenolife #pleasehelp. That kind of thing.\nLook, you\u2019re not a marketing campaign. Your brunch is not searchworthy. Don\u2019t hashtag your life.\nMike:#Iagree.\nFarhad:Also, I hate writing this newsl \u2014 yeah, anyway, that\u2019s all I hate.\nMike:You know what I hate the most? Saying goodbye to you every week, Farhad. #goodbye"

        "title": "Morning Agenda: North Korea Linked to Attacks on Banks",
        "fulltext": "NORTH KOREA LINKED TO ATTACKS ON BANKS|Security researchers have tied several online breaches at Asian banks to North Korea,Nicole Perlroth and Michael Corkery report in DealBook.The\n                                                    digital security firm Symantec said that in three recent attacks,the thieves used a rare piece of code that had been seen in only two previous cases\u2014 the hacking attack on Sony Pictures\n                                                    in 2014 and attacks on banks and media companies in South Korea the year before.\nSymantec researchers said the evidence linked an attack at a bank in the Philippines last October with attacks on Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam in December and another in February that resulted in the theft\n                                                    of $81 million from the central bank of Bangladesh.\nEric Chien, a security researcher at Symantec who found the code used across the attacks, said it wasthe first time that a nation had used online attacks for financial gain.\nThe attacks raised alarm bells because the thieves gained access to Swift, which is considered the world\u2019s most secure payment messaging system. It is used by 11,000 banks and companies to move money\n                                                    between countries, making it a tempting target. Swift itself had warned of a coordinated assault on banks, although it stressed that it was the banks\u2019 connections to its networks, rather than\n                                                    the network itself, that were breached.\nThe possibility that Pyongyang had turned to digital theft was not surprising.North Korea\u2019s economy has been ravaged by sanctions and food shortages.Its gross domestic product was estimated\n                                                    to be $12 billion to $40 billion, compared with South Korea\u2019s $1.4 trillion.\n\u201cIf you presume it\u2019s North Korea, $1 billion is almost 10 percent of their G.D.P.,\u201d Mr. Chien said.\u201cThis is not small change for them.\u201d\nThere isno evidence to date that the thieves have gone after large American or European banks, though new possible attacks are being reported weekly. Last week, evidence emerged that Banco del Austro,\n                                                    an Ecuadorean bank, was infiltrated by hackers who were able to sneak into the Swift network.\nFireEye, the security firm investigating the intrusion on Bangladesh\u2019s central bank, is looking at several more undisclosed cases where banks\u2019 systems were compromised,The Wall Street Journal reports,\n                                                    citing a person familiar with the matter. The suspected attacks involved eight other banks, all of which are in Asia.\nAnalysts worry that the breaches could hold back global finance; larger banks may become reluctant or even refuse to transact with smaller banks in the developing world unless they have assurances\n                                                    that their networks would not be compromised.\n\nGOOGLE WINS COPYRIGHT DISPUTE WITH ORACLE|A judged ruled in Google\u2019s favor in a legal dispute with Oracle over software\n                                                    used to power most of the world\u2019s smartphones,Nick Wingfield and Quentin Hardy report in The New York Times.\nOracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in the software code for the Android mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it had made fair use of that\n                                                    code and owed nothing.\nSoftware developers, who operate in the same way Google did when it comes to open-source software, cheered the victory. Open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use\n                                                    and modify.\nChris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, called it \u201cgreat news for progress and innovation.\u201d\nAndroid relies in part on Java, an open-source software language the Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010.Oracle accused Google executives of violating Oracle\u2019s copyright by using aspects of Java without permission.\nThe courtroom fight could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the\n                                                    world\u2019s biggest data centers.People who worked with open-source technology had feared that a victory for Oracle would lead to other similar demands.\nDorian Daley, Oracle\u2019s general counsel, said the company planned to appeal. \u201cWe strongly believe that Google developed Android by illegally copying core Java technology to rush into the mobile\n                                                    device market,\u201d she said in a statement.\nSome lawyers cautioned against viewing the verdict as a green light for the type of software development that Google practiced, saying that anearlier federal appeals court decision validated the idea that A.P.I.s can be copyrighted.\n\u201cI think what you\u2019re still going to see is a lot more attention paid to securing approval to use other copyrights before the fact,\u201d said Christopher Carani, a lawyer at McAndrews, Held\n                                                    & Malloy.\n\nCOURT RULES AGAINST IMPOSED ARBITRATION|A federal appeals court ruled the companies cannot force their employees to sign away\n                                                    their right to band together in legal actions,Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Noam Scheiber report in DealBook.The decision was a major  victory for American workers and opened up an opportunity for the Supreme Court to weigh in.\nIn its opinion, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago said that Epic Systems, a health care software provider in Verona, Wis., violated federal labor law when it required\n                                                    its workers to bring disputes individually to arbitration.\nThe court said thatby preventing employees from joining together in a collective action, the arbitration clause ran afoul of a critical piece of the National Labor Relations Act, a landmark 1935 law that gave workers the right to unionize and engage in concerted action.\nThe decision directly conflicts with an earlier decision by an appeals court in Louisiana and the split could prompt the Supreme Court to wade back into the fray.\nIn a pair of decisions in 2011 and 2013, the Supreme Court blessed the use of arbitration in a case pushed by a group of credit card companies. The credit card companies turned to a 1925 federal law that\n                                                    formalized arbitration as a means for companies to hash out their disputes with one another.\nCourts across the country have largely upheld arbitration clauses, deferring to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the Federal Arbitration Act beat even federal laws.\n\nON THE AGENDA|The Commerce Department will publish the first revision of its estimate forfirst-quarter economic growthat 8:30 a.m.Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will receive the Radcliffe Medal at Harvard in Cambridge, Mass., at 12:30 p.m. The presentation will be followed by a discussion\n                                                    with Gregory Mankiw, a professor of economics at Harvard.\n\nGAWKER\u2019S FOUNDER CRITICIZES CAMPAIGN AGAINST COMPANY|Nick Denton, the founder and majority owner of Gawker, has published\n                                                    an open letter to Peter Thiel, calling him\u201cthin-skinned\u201d and a \u201ccomic book villain,\u201dKatie Rogers and Michael J. de la Merced report in DealBook.Mr. Denton challenged Mr Thiel, who this week\n                                                    revealed that he was funding several lawsuits against Gawker, to a public debate about the role of journalism in society.\n\u201cThis vindictive decade-long campaign is quite out of proportion to the hurt you claim,\u201d Mr. Denton wrote. He issued a play-by-play account of past stories that drew Mr. Thiel\u2019s ire\n                                                    and of two defamation lawsuits currently pending against Gawker,criticizing what he characterized as an inability by Silicon Valley figures to accept criticism by journalists.\nMr. Denton assured Mr. Thiel that Gawker\u2019s journalists would be reporting on his involvement in lawsuits against the company.\nGawker also acknowledged that it had recently hired Mark Patricof, a senior banker at the firm Houlihan Lokey, to provide financial advice. Houlihan Lokey is known for its mergers and corporate restructuring\n                                                    expertise, butthe company refused to address reports that a potential buyer had emerged.\nGawker\u2019s strategic review is in its early stages and Mr. Denton has not decided on how to proceed, according to people with direct knowledge of the plans.The company had considered potential offers  this year that were as high as $350 million,\n                                                    said people with direct knowledge of the matter.\nQuestions about whether press freedom is in danger have also been raised,Ms. Rogers and John Herrman report in The New York Times.\nSome journalists felt that Mr. Thiel\u2019s political views andhis connection with Donald J. Trump could be worrisome as Mr. Trump has made comments about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue news outlets.\nOthers still debatedwhether it was appropriate for outside parties to fund lawsuits in the way Mr. Thiel did. Marc Andreessen, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, wrote on Twitter that \u201cGreenpeace\n                                                    and Sierra Club, among many other progressive groups, routinely fund other plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuits.\u201d\nLegal experts maintained that regardless of the sources of funding, cases would still succeed or fall based on their merits,Barry Meier writes in The Times.Lawsuits financed by third parties are legal. Business groups have claimed that outside investing helps fuel frivolous litigations, but others see it as a boon for plaintiffs without resources to take\n                                                    on deep-pocketed defendants.\nThe news also raised debate among Times readers. \u201cIt sends a message to other media outlets to watch who and what they\u2019re writing stories about,\u201d Superamerickson of Minneapolis wrote.\u201cDon\u2019t investigate rich people or you\u2019ll get shut down.\u201d\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nAXA to Sell SunLife and British Pensions Business

        "fulltext": "Q.I changed my Mac\u2019s user password for security reasons and ever since, I have been getting messages about programs wanting my \u201cLogin Keychain Password.\u201d What is this and why is it happening?\nA.The OS X operating system comes with its own password-management utility program calledKeychain Accessthat stores your account names and accompanying passwords for file servers, programs, websites and other services you use with your Mac. (Apple also has a similar feature callediCloud Keychainthat syncs usernames, passwords, credit-card numbers and other information for sites and services between Macs running OS X and mobile devices using iOS.)\nYou may not have realized it at the time, butyou created this login password keychainwhen you first went through the assistant programs that opened automatically and guided you through the setting up your new Mac for the first time.\nThe information you store in the keychain is encrypted and locked with its own password \u2014 which is usually the same password you use to log into your computer. As you recentlychanged the login password, the Mac is probably pestering you with messages about your login keychain password because it is still trying to use your old OS X login password instead of the new one.\nToget the login keychain up to datewith the new password you are using for your OS X account, go to the Mac\u2019s Applications folder, then to the Utilities folder within and open the Keychain Access program; from the Mac\u2019s desktop Finder, you can also press the Shift, Command and A keys to open the Applications folder. When the Keychain Access program has opened, go to the Edit menu and select the \u201cChange Password for Keychain \u2018login\u2019\u201d option.\nIn the box for Current Password, put in your old OS X login password. In the New Password box, enter your current OS X password and verify it. Click O.K. when you are done.\nIf you are still having trouble with persistent messages, you canstart over with a fresh, empty login keychain. In the Keychain Access menu, open Preferences and select Reset My Default Keychain. You can find additional information in the Keychain Access program by going to the Help menu and opening the guide."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s $1 Billion Investment May Ease Ties With China",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 A$1 billion investment by Apple in a Chinese ride-hailing appis a rounding error for the Silicon Valley giant, which generates about $4 billion in profit every month and has $233 billion in cash and securities in the bank.\nBut Apple\u2019s surprising interest in the company, called Didi Chuxing, and its out-of-character willingness to publicize the news Thursday evening could go a long way toward showing the Chinese government it is interested in supporting local business.\nMore than any other major American technology company, Apple has had huge success in China. In the last fiscal year, Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products.\nWith that success has come huge risk. In recent years, Beijing has grown more aggressive in pushing an agenda aimed at expanding local tech companies, forcing multinationals to play by its rules if they want access to China\u2019s markets.\nApple has faced increasedscrutinyrecently in China, where regulators shut its iBooks and iTunes movie stores. Other companies that have hit such roadblocks, like Cisco, Microsoft and Qualcomm, responded by investing in local partnerships and trying to portray themselves not simply as foreign companies, but as stakeholders in China.\n\u201cApple must be increasingly sensitive to the need to improve its government relations and to stake out a more entrenched position in the China market,\u201d said Mark Natkin, managing director of the China technology research firm Marbridge Consulting. \u201cSo making a sizable investment in a leading Chinese I.T. company will buy it a lot of good will.\u201d\nHe added that Apple would probably have to follow up the investment with other partnerships and spending in China if it wanted to stay in Beijing\u2019s good graces.\nIn Apple\u2019s case, the new investment also helps it show Beijing how its operating system and iPhones are closely linked with the rise of app development within China; Didi\u2019s app, for example, is the most downloaded ride-hailing software in China.\n\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said in a news release.\nFor nearly a decade, Apple\u2019s phenomenal growth was powered by the popularity of the iPhone. But sales of the device have slowed and last month the company reported itsfirst quarterly dropever in iPhone sales, along with its first drop in overall revenue in 13 years.\nMany investors hoped that strong growth in China would offset some of the iPhone\u2019s deceleration. Revenue growth in the greater China region, which includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, hovered around 70 percent or more all last year. But last month the company said that quarterly sales in greater China had fallen 26 percent compared with the previous year.\nFor Didi, the deal is a way to beef up its systems. The Chinese company serves close to 300 million users across more than 400 Chinese cities \u2014 more users than Uber \u2014 but lags technologically, analysts say.\nFor more than a year, Apple and Didi \u2014 which share several partners, including Japan\u2019s SoftBank and Coatue \u2014 had been in contact. Apple was one of a handful of technology companies that, over the last year, Didi had talked with to better familiarize itself with the West, according to a person briefed on the deal.\nIn April, Mr. Cook sat down for the first time with the leaders of Didi to discuss working together.\nJust three weeks later, Apple was ready to take things to the next level with the announcement on Thursday of the$1 billion bet on Didi, one of its largest investments ever.\nIn the midst of Didi\u2019s last major round of raising funds, the relationship quickly deepened, the person said. The two companies managed to close the deal with \u201clightning speed,\u201d Didi\u2019s president, Jean Liu, said in a conference call discussing the deal late Thursday.\nThe two will work together on technology, marketing and products, Ms. Liu added.\nMr. Cook has repeatedly said that Apple is looking for investment opportunities for its huge cash hoard. Apple has invested small sums in app developers before, and the company views China\u2019s app developer community as a prime source of future growth.\n\u201cWhat this means to me is that Apple is firmly committed to the Chinese market,\u201d said Brian Blau, an analyst with the Gartner research firm. \u201cThey are going to look at lots of opportunities.\u201d\nApple\u2019s move also draws it further into a Chinese market crisscrossed with competitive alliances. With the investment, Apple is now aligned with China\u2019s two largest Internet companies, Tencent and Alibaba, as a major shareholder in Didi. And Didi gained Apple as a big-name ally in its battle with Uber in China.\nGoogle\u2019s chief legal officer and head of corporate development, David Drummond, is on the board of Uber. And in 2013 Google\u2019s venture capital arm, GV, invested $258 million in Uber.\nBut the partnership between Uber and Google has grown more distant over the past few years as both sides have independently pursued self-driving car projects. Uber has also made moves to wean itself from Google\u2019s map technology, including an acquisition of the mapping start-up deCarta.\nInvesting in ride-hailing services gives Apple a doorway into the world\u2019s largest auto market and smartphone market by cars and phones sold, and an opportunity to better integrate its devices with cars in China. China\u2019s Internet companies are already hard at work developing driverless car technology and entertainment systems for cars, many of which are based on Google\u2019s Android software.\nApple has been working on its own secretcar project,which one independent analyst, Neil Cybart, said accounted for a huge share of the billions of dollars in research and development spending by the company.\n\u201cMaybe they could be a technology supplier to Didi,\u201d Mr. Blau said. \u201cMaybe they could learn from Didi.\u201d\nThe auto market might be one new way that Apple can keep itself relevant to Chinese leaders who often view foreign tech firms in terms of how much utility they have in China as teachers of local companies, Mr. Natkin of Marbridge Consulting said.\n\u201cAs that utility wanes, the room to maneuver dwindles and the welcome mat starts to get drawn under the door,\u201d he said."
