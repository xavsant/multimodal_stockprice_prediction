        "fulltext": "Q.I want to transfer my music library out of iTunes. What is the easiest and most effective way to do this?\nA.Among its functions, Apple\u2019s iTunes program serves as a database for sorting and organizing your digital media collection. However, the files that make up that media collection primarily live in a folder called iTunes Media (or iTunes Music) on the computer. To move the music library, you just need to find and move the folder to the external hard drive or the cloud service you wish to use.\nUnless you have changed the location of your iTunes Music/Media folder,you can find it in your user folder on the computer. On a Windows PC, look in My Music and then the iTunes folder; on a Mac, open the Music folder and then the iTunes folder.\nBefore you copy the folder elsewhere, however, you might want to make sure all the files listed in the iTunes window are actually stored within it. To do that, open iTunes, go to the File menu, to Library and choose Consolidate Files. This makes a copy of any file not already in the iTunes folder. When you open the iTunes Music subfolder, you should see nestled folders containing the MP3, AAC and other digital audio files you have been using.\nOnce you are sure you have all the music files in the folder, you can drag it to your new location for use with a different desktop jukebox program, media-server software likePlex, or an online music locker likeGoogle Play Music ManagerorAmazon Music.\nKeep in mind that any iTunes files that were purchased with copyright protection built in may not play in a different program, but tracks you ripped from your own compact discs or purchased without copy restrictions should be fine as long as they are compatible with your new software."

Could you ditch them?Related Article\nApple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, are not just the largest technology companies in the world. As I\u2019ve argued repeatedly in my column, they are also becoming the most powerful companies of any kind, essentially inescapable for any consumer or business that wants to participate in the modern world. But which of the Frightful Five is most unavoidable? I ponder the question in my column this week.\nBut what about you?If an evil monarch forced you to choose, in what order would you give up these inescapable giants of tech?\n(Click the icons in the order you'd drop them.)\nProduced by Scott Blumenthal, Samuel Jacoby, and Gray Beltran\nAdvertisement"
