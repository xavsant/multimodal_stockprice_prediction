        "title": "Trump\u2019s China Fight Puts U.S. Tech in the Cross Hairs",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump says his trade war with China will protect America\u2019s dominance and derail Beijing\u2019s plan for technological and economic supremacy.\nBut as the fightkicks into high gear this week, American tech and telecom companies are warning that the industry\u2019s growing reliance on products made and assembled in China means they are more likely to be casualties, not victors, in the skirmish.\nMr. Trump\u2019s next round of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods goes into effect on Monday, hitting thousands of consumer products from handbags to refrigerators to bicycles. The tariffs will also hit the tech and telecom companies that provide much of the gear that powers the internet, mobile networks, data storage and other technology. United States customs will begin collecting a tax on circuit boards, semiconductors, cell tower radios, modems and other products made and assembled in China and exported into America.\nThose tariffs, Intel warned in a letter last month, are \u201ca game changer for the American consumer.\u201d The tariffs begin at a rate of 10 percent and increase to 25 percent next January.\nLike American automakers and other manufacturers, the tech sector has increasingly outsourced production to China, where manufacturing and assembly of products is cheaper than in the United States. In recent decades, Intel, Dell, and Apple began shifting manufacturing overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs and align operations closer to customers in emerging markets.\nIntel, for instance, designs and manufactures most semiconductors in the United States but relies on Chinese facilities for assembly of their chips, which will now be taxed. Moving those manufacturing and assembly operations outside of China is unrealistic, the company has warned, saying \u201cit is too expensive to relocate established and integrated supply chains.\u201d\nGoogle, Dell, IBM and others say the tariffs will increase costs for companies and consumers, hindering America\u2019s ability to dominate the next generation of technology, like 5G wireless networks. Rising prices, the industries say, will slow business growth, increase costs for consumers and put other nations, like China, in a more competitive position to dominate tech.\n\u201cThe tariffs affect the heart of the infrastructure of the internet,\u201d said Rob Atkinson, president of the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, a think tank financed by tech companies including Microsoft, Google and Intel. \u201cIf we are going to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, we should impose them on items that hurt the Chinese, not us.\u201d\nMr. Trump does not share that view, seeing the tariffs as a weapon to force China to change trade practices that the administration \u2014 and many companies, including tech firms \u2014 say are unfair.\n\u201cChina is engaged in numerous unfair policies and practices relating to United States technology and intellectual property \u2014 such as forcing United States companies to transfer technology to Chinese counterparts,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement last week.\nTech companies agree that China has long pressured American companies to hand over valuable technology to do business in China or engaged in outright theft of intellectual property. But they argue that using tariffs as a retaliatory measure will hurt American companies while doing little to change China\u2019s ways.\nTech and telecommunications products are among the fastest growing imports from China. In 2014, electronics accounted for 40 percent of all Chinese imports, according to the United States International Trade Commission. While the total value of telecommunications parts affected by the latest round of tariffs is unclear, the Telecommunications Industry Association estimates \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of dollars in extra costs for companies.\nChad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics,has estimated that $24 billion in telecommunications equipmentwill be subject to the next round of tariffs.\nThe impact on the industry is amplified by the timing, as the United States and China race one another to dominate the next generation of ultrafast wireless networks, known as 5G. The faster networks will fuel the use of artificial intelligence in driverless cars and robotics and other technologies used by military. Companies have warned that the administration\u2019s tariffs will undercut Mr. Trump\u2019s stated plan to lead in those areas.\nIn March, Mr. Trumpblockeda bid by Singapore telecom giant Broadcom, which was angling to buy San Diego-based Qualcomm, citing concerns that handing over a United States company to an Asian one with links to China would pose a national security threat and make the United States less competitive in 5G.\nOfficials at Nokia, a Finnish telecommunications equipment giant with large United States operations,met with regulators at the Federal Communications Commissionin August to warn that the tariffs target components critical to 5G. The Trump administration has declared 5G mobile networks a key security and economic goal.\n\u201cThese latest duties threaten to raise the cost of 5G infrastructure in the U.S. by hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Nokia officials told the F.C.C., according to public filings.\nThe semiconductor maker Micronwarnedlast week that its profits would take a hit from the tariffs. The Boise, Idaho-based company said it would try to reduce further losses by shifting its purchases of supplies to countries other than China.\n\u201cOf course, this is related to some of the product that we import into the U.S. that is manufactured in China, and we are very much focused on mitigating that manufacturing,\u201d Micron\u2019s chief executive, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in an interview on CNBC.\nOther companies are weighing legal options. A leading trade group, the Consumer Technology Association, which represents 2,000 tech companies, said the administration is overstepping its authority on trade policy and is considering legal action against the administration.\n\u201cWe are exploring all options,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, the association\u2019s president, said when asked if his group would sue the administration. \u201cThe tariffs will stifle our global leadership in 5G, create and internet tax on business and cause uncertainty for companies.\u201d\nThe inclusion of tech products only increased tension between the tech industry and the Trump administration. Silicon Valley has sparred with Mr. Trump on immigration. Mr. Trump accused tech giants Facebook, Twitter and Google of political bias against conservatives and Amazon of avoiding tax payments. The companies have refuted the president\u2019s claims.\nSome companies have been partially spared. After intense lobbying by Apple and Fitbit, the Trump administration removed several consumer electronics products from the latest round of tariffs. Left off the list are technologies that affect Apple\u2019s Watch and other fitness trackers, AirPod earbuds and wireless speakers. The administration spared a total of 300 products from an earlier proposal drafted in July.\nOn Friday, a senior administration official who has been engaged in trade negotiations defended the decision to offer relief to Apple\u2019s products. In a briefing with reporters at the White House, the official rejected the notion that winners and losers were being determined based on lobbying power.\n\u201cThis has been talked about a lot as an Apple issue, Apple has been very vocal about it, but the tariff lines that have been exempted, they applied to a whole range of companies in addition to Apple,\u201d the official said, speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that the trade battle with China would be resolved.\nWhen asked about the exemptions of Apple\u2019s products, Mr. Cook said that while the iPhone is assembled in China, many parts are made and developed in the United States. The tariffs would cost a company like Apple when it imports devices assembled in China.\n\u201cI think they looked at this and said that it\u2019s not really great for the United States to put a tariff on those type of products,\u201d Mr. Cook said."

        "title": "The New iPhones Look Fine. But My Old One Is Better Than Ever.",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s new offerings are so good that I\u2019m not buying a new iPhone.\nI expect to save hundreds of dollars this year and enjoy what I\u2019ve already got, because, thanks to Apple, my old iPhone 6 is performing better than ever.\nThis is the result of two unusual moves by the trillion-dollar corporation. One was Apple\u2019s release this month of a new operating system that not only makes its new iPhones run well, but can also radically improve the performance of millions of old ones.\nThe other action was Apple\u2019s decision last winter to let iPhone owners replace deteriorating batteries at a sharp discount under a program thatcontinuesthrough the end of the year. In combination, the two measures have thoroughly rejuvenated my old phone, and have the potential to do so for many others.\nI don\u2019t attribute this to pure altruism on Apple management\u2019s part. Making old products run well for a long time is truly \u201cthe right thing to do for our customers,\u201d Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive,saidabout battery replacement program. But it is also a smart business practice that can help Apple investors prosper over the long term, even if its actions deter some consumers from buying new iPhones now.\nUnless articles like this one spur millions of people to defer purchases, Apple may have found a business strategy that allows the company to have it both ways: Charge ever more money for fancy new phones, while enhancing its reputation by providing value-oriented consumers with reliable products that can last for years.\nWhat\u2019s the magic that has rejuvenated my iPhone and given it powers it didn\u2019t possess when I first bought it, nearly four years ago?\nThe answer is mundane. My old iPhone started getting younger in February, when I took advantage of the Apple discount to replace the phone\u2019s aging battery for $29, down from the usual $79 out-of-warranty fee.\nUntil last winter, I had never even thought of replacing an iPhone battery. I accepted that it would wear out every couple of years, and assumed that because of the way Apple had engineered the iPhone, the smart move was to replace the entire device with a new, improved model. My phone appeared to be on its last legs. It ran out of power in a few hours, and sometimes shut down inexplicably.\nBut then came Apple\u2019s \u201cbatterygate.\u201d A furor arose as multiple iPhone ownersreportedthat their devices were malfunctioning. It turned out that Apple had issued a new operating system that deliberately throttled speed when decaying batteries couldn\u2019t cope with the normal tasks involved in running the phones.\nCould this have been a case of planned obsolescence of a nefarious sort, the deliberate ruination of a perfectly good product to spur sales of a new one? I am not convinced that it was, although suspicions have been rampant for years that this kind of behavior might be standard for big tech companies. Facing widespread criticism, as well as lawsuits that arependingin California, Apple apologized late last year.\nIn astatementat the time, the company said it had meant well and had merely been trying to keep phones working longer. Critically, Apple said it would offer expedited services at lower prices for owners of old phones who wanted to replace their batteries. In March,the company also issueda minor operating system upgrade that made it easier for iPhone users to understand what was happening to their batteries.\nWhile my new battery made my phone serviceable again, I still assumed I would have to replace it when Apple introduced the new models, and a new operating system, in September, as it does just about every year. New operating systems typically make old phones slow to a crawl.\nBut Apple executives said the new system, iOS 12, would be different. Older phones, going back to the 2013 model year, would work better this time, not worse. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing our efforts especially on the oldest devices,\u201dCraig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of software engineering, said in June. \u201cWhile it\u2019s still early days, we\u2019re excited with the results that we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\nApple now reports that in test conditions, older phones are indeed running much faster after iOS 12 has been installed. For example, the company says, the camera app opens 70 percent faster, the keyboard starts 50 percent faster, and under a heavy workload, multiple apps work up to two times as fast. In a fullreview, Ars Technica, the Cond\u00e9 Nast website, found similarly impressive results.\nI downloaded the new software, and my phone works spectacularly now. Some people who installed iOS 12 have reported minor glitches, but that hasn\u2019t been my experience. My phone can\u2019t do everything the new iPhone Xs can do, but it seems fast enough to me.\nPlus, it\u2019s doing things it never did before. When I connect it with my car, for example, and start upCarPlay, I can now choose to see Google Maps on the dashboard, not Apple\u2019s proprietary and, in my view, inferior mapping system. Allowing me to make that choice is the mark of a confident company.\nA lot of other things are possible with my iPhone now. Searching for photos of family members is now staggeringly easy. Most important, the phone\u2019s internal capacity seems to have been enlarged: I can read a book, switch to a magazine, start an audiobook app, return to The New York Times website, check my heartbeat and see how many miles I jogged this morning, all without crashing the phone.\nModerating this kind of addictive overuse is easier, too, thanks to functions that make it simpler to turn off annoying messages for extended periods. It\u2019s like having a new, speedy phone, without having to buy one.\nWhat\u2019s the upside for Apple? By supporting my aging iPhone years after what might have been its sell-by date, the company has increased the odds that \u2014 when I do actually need a new phone \u2014 I will remain in the Apple universe, expensive as it may be to live there. My old phone, which cost $649 new, seems like a much better deal now, considering all the use I\u2019m getting out of it.\nEven before the latest changes, many people had been delaying buying a new phone. In Apple-speak, the iPhone replacement cycle has lengthened, and annual sales have not yet returned to the 2015 peak of 231 million units sold. As Toni Sacconaghi, senior analyst with Bernstein, points out, \u201cIf the iPhone replacement cycle continues to elongate meaningfully, that could undermine Apple\u2019s fundamental economics.\u201d\nBut for Apple, the saving grace is a surge in the average sales price from $671 for all of 2015 to well over $700 for the first three quarters of this year. In a mature smartphone market, pushing the average price higher \u2014 and it\u2019s rising at double-digit levels, the company says \u2014 is crucial to corporate growth.\nAs the most valuable company in the world, Apple can surely afford to treat its customers well. By doing so, it may be able to keep millions of people paying for increasingly expensive products. And if some of us wait a year or two because we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019ve got, it won\u2019t be the end of Apple\u2019s prosperous world."

        "title": "Apple Watch Series 4 Review: A Big Step for Wearable Gadgets",
        "fulltext": "A few days ago, I sat in a medical recliner at the University of California, San Francisco. A cardiologist placed 10 stickerlike electrodes onto my limbs and chest and then connected the wires to a dated-looking contraption with a screen and a keyboard on a cart.\nAbout a minute later, a printer produced a chart of my heart\u2019s electrical activity on red graph paper. The procedure I had undergone was an electrocardiogram, or an EKG, which is used to diagnose cardiac problems like arrhythmia and heart attacks.\nI took the test to gain a better understanding of the implications of the Apple Watch Series 4, Apple\u2019s new smart watch, whichwill become available Friday. For the first time, the watch includes an electrical heart sensor that will eventually work with an app that takes EKGs. When the EKG app, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is released this year, we will be able to place a finger on the watch\u2019s crown to measure the electrical charges across our hearts.\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s EKG won\u2019t be nearly as comprehensive as the one produced by a traditional electrocardiograph, which hooks up to multiple parts of the body, like the one the cardiologist used on me. The watch is a single-lead EKG device, meaning it will record one angle of the heart\u2019s electrical signals \u2014 enough to collect data about arrhythmia but not to diagnose a heart attack.\nStill, the new Apple Watch is perhaps one of the most significant developments in wearable gadgets in years. People with heart problems can easily use the EKG app to take electrocardiograms whenever they sense something abnormal, without the rigmarole I went through. And the data can be shared immediately with their doctor, which could open a conversation about next steps, like going in for a visit or modifying treatment.\nFor everyone else who doesn\u2019t have a confirmed heart condition, this feature will not immediately be a selling point.\n\u201cI\u2019m not recommending it for most people as anything other than just a novelty,\u201d said Dr. Ethan Weiss, the cardiologist who took my EKG.\nBut he added that the implications for heart research were profound. \u201cThere\u2019s all this stuff we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Typically, an EKG in a doctor\u2019s office provides up to 90 seconds of data. \u201cWe\u2019re only getting little snippets,\u201d Dr. Weiss said.\nMuch of the rest of theApple Watch Series 4sounds boring on paper. Compared with its predecessors, the fourth-generation smart watch has a slightly larger screen and is faster at tasks like loading apps.\nYet the watch\u2019s evolution from a fitness tracker intoa health-monitoring devicemakes it vastly more interesting in the long term. Apple often sets the standard for consumer electronics, so the watch may prompt other companies to create a generation of wearable devices that help people gather information about their health conditions.\nIn the meantime, I tested the new Apple Watch for a week and found it incrementally better than the previous version. Here are the highlights.\nThe most apparent changes to the new Apple Watch show up in its higher price and larger screen and case.\nThe new models start at $399, compared with $329 previously. The two sizes are 40 millimeters and 44 millimeters, up from 38 millimeters and 42 millimeters. But while the case is now slightly longer and wider, it is also thinner, and the 40-millimeter model didn\u2019t feel bulkier than the 38-millimeter Apple Watch that I used in the past.\nMore important, the screen stretches out from one edge to the other, letting apps take up more of the watch\u2019s face. This enlarged display makes everything on the watch look better, including text.\nA less obvious, though still useful, change is the watch\u2019s speed. Apple emphasized that the device was two times faster than the third-generation model, which was already zippy.\nThe speed difference was most noticeable when using Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant. By simply raising the watch toward my mouth, I could speak a command like \u201cSet a timer for 20 minutes,\u201d and the watch reacted with barely any delay. The hands-free ability to summon Siri is a feature of Apple\u2019s new watch operating system, WatchOS 5. In my book, this is how watches were meant to be used: without having to press any buttons.\nTo test the watch\u2019s fitness-tracking capabilities, I wore it on a 7.7-mile hike in Pacifica, Calif. I opened the Workout app on the watch, chose hiking as a workout and paid close attention to the device\u2019s tracking of my walking distance and heart rate.\nThroughout the hike, I wondered about my progress. How many miles to the end of the trail? Had I gone too far and gotten lost?\nThe Apple Watch relieved me of anxiety by updating the distance I had hiked for every tenth of a mile. By the end of the trek, the Apple Watch said I had hiked precisely 7.7 miles. Impressive accuracy.\nDuring steep inclines throughout the hike, I glanced at the watch to check my heart rate. With past Apple Watch models, there was a delay before they showed me. But the new model, with its improved speed, updated with my current heart rate almost instantaneously.\nWhile the Apple Watch Series 4 is a solid piece of technology and another step toward the maturity of wearable computers, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for people who are considering a smart watch for the first time.\nHere\u2019s why: $399 is a stiff price to pay for a gadget with lightweight utility. Fortunately, Apple is selling its olderSeries 3 watch, which I rated as a great product last year, for $279. Now is a good time to get the older one.\nI wouldn\u2019t upgrade to the Series 4 from a recent generation of Apple Watch, either, because the improvements won\u2019t feel significant. But if you bought theoriginal Apple Watch in 2015and liked it, this will be a great upgrade. The first watch was sluggish, with limited battery life, and it no longer receives operating system updates. The Series 4 addresses all of the first-generation watch\u2019s flaws, and the speed boost will be a big step up.\nIf you are simply a health-conscious person, should you get the new watch? I wasn\u2019t able to test the EKG app because it is not out yet. Those with heart conditions would be wise to wait until Apple releases its electrocardiogram app this year to see if the technology works well.\nIt is also important to not regard the watch as a catchall device for health monitoring. Dr. Weiss said that even if the EKG app detected arrhythmia in a young person, for example, that information would not necessarily be useful because the condition might not cause a problem at a young age. Instead, it may just induce anxiety.\n\u201cWhat it is going to do is make you aware of having this condition, which could impact your insurance, which could impact your mental state and your state of happiness,\u201d Dr. Weiss said.\nThere is one demographic that may be more interested in the watch for health reasons: the elderly. Apart from the electrical heart sensor, the new watch can detect when its owner has taken a nasty fall. The feature isturned on by defaultfor people 65 and older (based on the birth date they entered into the watch\u2019s software), and the watch will automatically call emergency services and send a message to your emergency contact if you remain immobile for a minute after a fall.\nI struggled to trigger the fall detector. In the name of journalism, I took several dives at home onto my mattress, a couch and a dog bed to try to get it to work.\nI also headed to a rock climbing gym, where I climbed up six walls and fell onto a padded mattress onto my side and onto my back. No dice. Last, I clambered atop the gym\u2019s tallest wall \u2014 about 17 feet high \u2014 and dropped down. When I landed, the watch vibrated and chirped. Alas, it was only a notification alerting me that someone had liked a photo onmy dog\u2019s Instagram account.\nMy failure to trigger the fall detector was not necessarily a bad thing. To design the feature, Apple worked with people in assisted living facilities and movement disorder clinics to collect data about real slips and falls \u2014 not my phony ones.\nAs for my own health, the new Apple Watch basically showed me I was getting plenty of exercise. And for those who were wondering: Dr. Weiss pronounced that the heart activity from my EKG was normal."

The levies are expected to affect abroad range of consumer goods, from furniture to Apple Watches. Some Chinese officials advising the government in Beijing have proposed restrictions on the sale of materials and equipment that are important for American manufacturers,according to The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources. Those officials specifically said that such curbs could affect Apple, though they didn\u2019t explain how.\nBack story:Apple has warned that the tariffs could hurt sales of its devices, including Apple Watches and HomePod speakers. Ina letterto the United States trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, sent earlier this month, the company wrote: \u201cBecause all tariffs ultimately show up as a tax on U.S. consumers, they will increase the cost of Apple products that our customers have come to rely on in their daily lives.\u201d\nWhat it means:New levies and extra punitive actions by China could force Apple to raise the prices of its devices just ahead of the holiday season \u2014 a crucial sales period for the company. There appears to be little sign that either Mr. Trump or the Chinese government will de-escalate the situation.\nWhat to watch:Apple\u2019s stock price.

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Takeover of Shazam Is Cleared by European Regulators",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 European authorities on Thursday cleared Apple\u2019s acquisition of the popular song-recognition app Shazam, after months of study into whether the deal would give the iPhone maker an unfair advantage over rival streaming music services like Spotify.\nApple said in December that it had agreed to buy Shazam, prompting European regulators to scrutinize the proposed takeover as part of a broader effort to examine the value of data when evaluating mergers.\nIn the case of Apple\u2019s deal for Shazam, regulators questioned whether the app held important information on Apple competitors. The focus on data transfer is a departure from typical antitrust enforcement, which tends to zero in on how a deal may affect customers in terms of a product\u2019s cost.\n\u201cData is key in the digital economy,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust enforcer at the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive arm,said in a statement. \u201cWe must therefore carefully review transactions which lead to the acquisition of important sets of data, including potentially commercially sensitive ones, to ensure they do not restrict competition.\u201d\nThe Apple deal, Ms. Vestager said, would not impede competition.\nThe case was a rare instance in which European antitrust authorities have passed on an opportunity to act against an American technology giant. The region has gained a reputation as the world\u2019s strictest overseer of the technology industry.\nIn 2016, Ireland wasordered to recoup13 billion euros, or about $15.1 billion, in back taxes from Apple, a decision both the company and the Irish government are appealing. Amazon, Facebook, Google and the American chip-maker Qualcomm have also been fined in recent years. This year, European authorities saw through the most stringent data protection rules in the world, as well, raising the prospect of further penalties.\nWhen starting their investigation of the Apple-Shazam deal in February, regulators said they were concerned that Apple would block Shazam from referring customers to rival services, or that it would use the app to poach customers.\nOn Thursday, the European Commission said that after a six-month review, it had concluded that the app did not give Apple an unfair advantage that merited government intervention.\n\u201cAccess to Shazam\u2019s data would not materially increase Apple\u2019s ability to target music enthusiasts and any conduct aimed at making customers switch would only have a negligible impact,\u201d the commission said in a statement.\nSpotify, a major rival to Apple\u2019s own music-streaming service, declined to comment.\nShazam was an early hit in Apple\u2019s App Store thanks to its novel ability to quickly identify a track after using a smartphone\u2019s microphone to \u201clisten\u201d for only a few seconds. The two companies established closer ties in 2014, when Shazam was integrated into Apple\u2019s voice-powered digital assistant Siri, allowing users to ask, \u201cHey Siri, what song is playing?\u201d\nThe app mainly makes money by selling advertisements and collecting fees when it refers users to a music service like Apple and Spotify. Shazam is also a valuable source of data, giving music companies insight into what songs and artists are performing well, and in which regions.\nApple\u2019s deal for Shazam has been seen as a possible test case for Ms. Vestager, who has said antitrust enforcement must evolve to consider the value of data.\nMs. Vestager has said that with free services, customers effectively pay with their data, and that they are not always getting a fair deal.\nBroadening the interpretation of antitrust law would have consequences for future acquisitions. But whether such an argument would hold up in a courtroom has not yet been well established, making it harder for authorities to step in.\nWorking in Apple\u2019s favor was the fact the European Commission had previously approved acquisitions between several data-rich companies, including Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of LinkedIn."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Qualcomm accused Apple of stealing proprietary software and sharing it with the rival chip makerIntelas part of a scheme to reduce Apple\u2019s reliance on Qualcomm technology.\nThe claim, made in documents filed in California Superior Court in San Diego on Monday night, add to charges that Qualcomm leveled last year and escalates a broad legal battle that has been raging between the two technology giants since early 2017.\nQualcomm said Apple had engaged in a \u201cmultiyear campaign of sloppy, inappropriate and deceitful conduct to steal Qualcomm\u2019s information and trade secrets\u201d to help improve the performance of Intel chips so they could match Qualcomm products.\nThe material taken included computer source code, software development tools and log files providing data about the performance of Qualcomm products, according to the filing.\nAn Apple spokesman referred on Tuesday to statements the company has issued since it began the legal struggle bysuing Qualcommin early 2017 over patent royalties that handset makers are required to pay the San Diego company. Apple argues that Qualcomm\u2019s business practices are illegally harming Apple and the entire tech industry.\nIn court documents, Apple has complained that Qualcomm has failed to provide evidence of any stolen information, though Apple has provided extensive access to corporate records. Qualcomm, in turn, accuses Apple of dragging its feet on providing information needed to bolster its charges.\nAn Intel spokesman declined to comment.\nQualcomm, the leading supplier of modem chips that allow smartphones to communicate over cellular networks, became Apple\u2019s main source for those kinds of chips in iPhones in 2011. But Apple has moved to drop Qualcomm as a supplier; the new iPhones announced this month use only modem chips from Intel.\nQualcomm, which has also been sued by the Federal Trade Commission and foreign regulatorsover its patent licensing practices, filed patent-infringement suits and other actions in response to Apple\u2019s suit. In the San Diego case, Qualcomm initially accused Apple of violating a key agreement governing the use of the two companies\u2019 proprietary technology.\nThat agreement contained a series of restrictions aimed at protecting Qualcomm source code and other information, restrictions that Apple violated, in part, by sharing information with Intel, Qualcomm said in the initial complaint.\nIn its latest move, Qualcomm provided more claims in its effort to persuade a judge to broaden the suit to cover theft of trade secrets. That question is expected to be considered at a hearing on Nov. 30, while a trial has been set for April.\nQualcomm officials, and some analysts, believe the dispute with Apple is essentially a dispute over how much the smartphone maker pays to license Qualcomm patents. Steve Mollenkopf, Qualcomm\u2019s chief executive, has held out hope that a settlement might be reached with Apple.\n\u201cThat really creates a much better environment for us to be able to resolve at least the licensing business issues that we have,\u201d Mr. Mollenkopf said in an interview in July.\nQualcomm\u2019s battle with Apple is one of many challenges the company has grappled with recently. It battled a takeover attempt by a rival, Broadcom, for four months before President Trump blocked the bid on national security grounds. More recently, Qualcomm called off a $44 billion bid to buy NXP after the Chinese authorities failed to approve the transaction."

An Apple spokeswoman said it was removed under company policies that prohibit apps from including content that is \u201coffensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust or in exceptionally poor taste.\u201d She declined to say whether any specific content in the app led to its removal.\n[Read more aboutthe reckoning, in court and public opinion,that threatens Mr. Jones\u2019s lucrative business.]\nApple had removed Mr. Jones\u2019s show from its podcast service on Aug. 5, leading Facebook, YouTube and other tech companiesto also eliminate Mr. Jones and his Infowars sitefrom their services. Those moves have cut off Mr. Jones from a wider audience; social media was his primary channel for finding new viewers. After those removals, downloads of the Infowars mobile app spiked, and Mr. Jones has recently been directing his followers to find his show through Infowars\u2019 website and app.\nApple\u2019s move does not affect iPhone users who had already downloaded the Infowars app, but it limits any more users from downloading it.

        "title": "\u2018Five Eyes\u2019 Nations Quietly Demand Government Access to Encrypted Data",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration and its closest intelligence partners have quietly warned technology firms that they will demand \u201clawful access\u201d to all encrypted emails, text messages and voice communications, threatening to compel compliance if the private companies refuse to voluntarily provide the information to the governments.\nThethreat was issuedlast week by the United States, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, the so-called Five Eyes nations that broadly share intelligence. Collectively, they have been frustrated by the spread of encrypted apps on cellphones and the ability to send encrypted messages through social media and, most prominently, on Apple\u2019s iPhones.\nThe issue flared repeatedly during the Obama administration, with the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, warning that law enforcement officials were \u201cgoing dark\u201d as nefarious actors relied on encrypted channels to discuss or plan criminal activity or terrorist plots. But the Trump administrationhassaid little about the subject, even after the meeting in Australia where the demand was issued in a joint statement by the five nations.\n\u201cShould governments continue to encounter impediments to lawful access to information necessary to aid the protection of the citizens of our countries,\u201d the joint statement said, \u201cwe may pursue technological, enforcement, legislative or other measures to achieve lawful access solutions.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, leaders from two major social media firms, Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Jack Dorsey of Twitter, will testify at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on curbing election interference by Russia and other powers. The social networks are also expected to answer Republican charges that their firms, and others, use their platforms to emphasize news media sources with liberal bias.\nBut the new demands by the five nations threaten to rekindle a debate that seized Washington and Silicon Valley after Apple gradually began encrypting more data on its phones.\nAt the core of the dispute is whether Apple, Facebook, Google and others should be compelled to provide a \u201cback door\u201d to their products that would allow government investigators to gain access to all communications, with a legal order.\nIt is far from clear that Congress is ready to take on the technology companies on this issue, especially because more companies and citizens are turning to encryption to protect sensitive conversations and financial transfers.\nOrdinary Americans \u2014 including President Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen \u2014 are also increasingly using encrypted apps to conduct delicate conversations to prevent monitoring by the government or others.\nOn Tuesday, staff members of key congressional committees said they had received no briefings on the new accord from Australia, and questioned how they could construct rules that provided access to all encrypted communications.\nOne Senate staff member said the memo was unenforceable in its current form.\nFacebook and Google were similarly surprised, and questioned what sort of measures would be put into place with companies that did not comply.\nFacebook did not comment directly on the memo, but referred questions back toa public blogit published in May explaining the company\u2019s policies on encryption, and why it did not want to create back doors.\n\u201cCybersecurity experts have repeatedly proven that it\u2019s impossible to create any back door that couldn\u2019t be discovered \u2014 and exploited \u2014 by bad actors,\u201d Facebook said in the blog post. \u201cIt\u2019s why weakening any part of encryption weakens the whole security ecosystem.\u201d\nThe debate was fueled in part by Apple\u2019s refusal to unlock an iPhone used by one of the attackers in a 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., as demanded by the F.B.I. A year earlier, Mr. Comey hadcited \u201cconcerns\u201d about encryption appsthat he described as \u201ccompanies marketing something expressly to allow people to hold themselves beyond the law.\u201d\nIn response, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, contended that once phones or messaging systems were designed to allow legal access, hackers from Russia, China, Iran, North Korea and elsewhere would use the breach to pry their way in, destroying technology devised to protect privacy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our job to provide you with the tools to lock up your stuff,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview in 2015.\nHe tried, unsuccessfully, to convince former President Barack Obama that there was no safe technological way to create back doors; Apple deliberately does not retain the keys to unlock those communications, so they can tell investigators, or the courts, that they are unable to comply with demands for access.\nBut Mr. Obama left office without resolving the issue of the government\u2019s ability to compel access. Both Mr. Trump and his rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton, sided with law enforcement authorities on giving access to the government.\nOne Facebook official, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said that the memo from Australia had no teeth, and was part of an escalating war between government officials and Silicon Valley over access to people\u2019s private data."

        "fulltext": "It\u2019s the time of year when smartphone makers introduce their newest wares to tempt you to spend your hard-earned dollars on the latest, priciest devices.\nThe gadget mania began last month, when Samsung started sellingits $1,000 Galaxy Note9, a luxurious device with an extra-large screen and the ability to be converted into a personal computer if connected with a display. Next month, Google is also holding an event where it is likely to show its newest Pixel smartphones.\n[Follow our live briefing coverage of the2018 Apple Event.]\nAnd this Wednesday, Apple is set to introduce three new iPhones, including some models with bigger screens and higher starting prices.\nAccording to a person briefed on Apple\u2019s new products, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential, the changes will include:\n\u2022 A new entry-level phone to replace the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, with a larger display, at 6.1 inches.\n\u2022 An updated, faster 5.8-inch iPhone X, whichApple took the wraps off last yearand priced at $999.\n\u2022 The introduction of a big-screen premium phone with a 6.5-inch display, Apple\u2019s biggest ever.\nIn what has become an ever-clearer trend, the prices of some of these new iPhones are also expected to go up. The new entry-level iPhone may start at $749, with the 5.8-inch iPhone X coming in at $949 and $1,049 for the giant 6.5-inch-screen model, analysts estimated. In contrast, just a few years ago Apple\u2019s iPhones started at $649 for the smaller model and $749 for the larger one.\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment on the prices of the new phones.\nThe increasing number of higher-priced, bigger-screen smartphones has become a well-worn strategy by the phone makers. Given that many people around the world \u2014 especially in developed countries \u2014 already own a phone and upgrade at a slower pace than they used to, phone vendors industrywide are focused on wringing more dollars out of each device by having them get larger and more expensive.\nSo where does that leave us? If you want to upgrade to some of the latest devices without breaking the bank, I have a few tips on how to achieve that.\nThe easiest way to save some money on your next phone is to trade in your current cellphone. In the last few years, wireless carriers and retailers have expanded their trade-in programs to be seamless and more inclusive.\nHere\u2019s an overview of how some of them work.\n\u2022 Apple offers a trade-in program called Apple GiveBack.On Apple\u2019s webpage, you can select the device you want to trade in, including iPhones or other smartphones from brands like Samsung, HTC and BlackBerry. You then answer a few questions about the model and condition of the phone to receive an estimate for what you can receive in Apple store credit. From there, you can take your phone to an Apple retail store or ask the company to send you a shipping kit to mail it in.\n\u2022 The carriers have similar programs.AT&T,Verizon,T-MobileandSprinteach accept a wide array of phones from various brands, which can be sold for credit that can be applied toward purchasing a new phone through the carrier.\n\u2022 Gazelle has an extensive buyback program.Theonline resellerwill let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs. Similar to Apple, Gazelle will send you a shipping kit to mail in your device, or you can just send it with your own packaging. The benefit of using Gazelle \u2014 which is one reason I prefer it \u2014 is that it will offer cash, whereas the others only offer store credit that is tied to specific merchants.\n\u2022 Best Buy offers gift credit in exchange for many used devices.Those include smartphones, tablets and video game hardware. This may be your most flexible trade-in option: Best Buy buys more types of devices from a broader array of brands than other buyback programs I have tested. In addition, the retailer sells phones that work with each of the big carriers.\nAfter trading in your phone, you can use the credit in a couple of ways.\nLet\u2019s say, for example, you are trading in an iPhone 7 to Verizon Wireless. The Verizon webpage offers $185 in credit for that phone, and you accept it.\nNow let\u2019s imagine that the next new iPhone costs $1,049. If you buy the device outright from Verizon, you could shave $185 off the $1,049, bringing the total to $864.\nOr you could opt to pay for the new iPhone with an installment plan and spread the cost of the phone into monthly payments. If Verizon hypothetically requires a $300 down payment for the new iPhone, your $185 in credit would reduce the amount you pay up front to $115. From there, you\u2019d pay $31.20 a month for 24 months to cover the remaining $749.\nYou could sell your old device directly to another consumer for a chance to get more cash than through a trade-in program. This is similar to how selling a used car in a private sale usually yields more money than trading it in at a dealership.\nThere are plenty of sites for listing your phone and selling it directly to another person, includingeBay,SwappaandGlyde. I have sold my used phones on eBay for roughly double what I was quoted by a device trade-in program.\nBut there are trade-offs: Some buyers can be a nuisance and bombard you with lots of questions or take a long time to send payment.\nYou could also ask your friends and family whether they want to buy your used phone. Just don\u2019t offer it to the hagglers among them.\nThere\u2019s an extra low-cost option, of course: Keep using the old phone and skip the upgrade altogether. Smartphones require periodicmaintenanceto keep running smoothly, but a bit of tender loving care will go a long way.\nIf your phone is feeling slow, there are methods tospeed it up. Those include hiring a repair shop toreplace your phone battery, clearing out storage from the device and doing a fresh install of the operating system.\nTaking care of your gadgets takes time. But with the rising costs of phones, the benefits are greater now that you will save even more by sticking with the tried and true."

Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, and Cecilia Malmstrom, the European commissioner for trade, are trying to reach an agreement on a plan to cut tariffs on industrial goods to zero and prevent President Trump from carrying out a threat to impose25 percent levies on car imports.An accord is unlikely on Monday, but businesses on both sides of the Atlantic will be looking for signs that the two sides are making progress.\n\u2014 Jack Ewing\nAUTOs\nA German court will begin hearing evidence on Monday in alawsuit filed by aggrieved shareholdersof the carmaker Volkswagen. The shareholders, who are seeking billions of euros in damages, contend that Volkswagen violated its legal responsibility to them when it deployedillegal software to cheat on emissions tests, then covered it up. The trial may be the first time high-ranking Volkswagen managers testify in open court about the origins of the scandal.\n\u2014 Jack Ewing\nTECHNOLOGY\nApple is set to announce another round of iPhones on Wednesday, in its annual bid to get customers to buy devices that are a few centimeters larger with a few more features. Apple is expected to unveil iPhones based on its flagship iPhone X model, with a screen that takes up the entire face of the device, but a bit larger, according tonews reportsandleaked images. Apple is also expected to update the Apple Watch, the iPad and its Mac computers, according to the reports. Sales of iPhones have leveled off \u2014 growth was less than 1 percent in the latest quarter \u2014 but Apple has made iPhone revenues continue to surge by charging customers more. Its iPhone revenues rose 20 percent last quarter because customers paid nearly 20 percent more, on average, for the devices.The iPhone X already costs $1,000so the question on Wednesday will be whether Apple is prepared to charge customers more than $1,000 for some iPhone models.\n\u2014 Jack Nicas\nECONOMY\nThe income of the median American household rose sharply in 2015 after years of stagnation, andcontinued to risein 2016. On Wednesday, theCensus Bureauwill release an initial estimate for 2017, which is likely to show that growth continued for a third straight year. Median household income is a particularly telling measure of the health of the American economy. The rise of the stock market says that life is good at the top; the fall of the unemployment rate says that life is getting better at the bottom. Median household income is a snapshot of the middle, where most Americans live. As of the end of 2016, the median household was still making less than at the end of 2007. That gap may finally have closed last year.\n\u2014 Binyamin Appelbaum\nTechnology\nThe European Parliamentis scheduled to vote on Wednesday on aninternet copyright billthat would require internet services to use filtering technology to screen out copyrighted music, writings and videos. Publishers, music companies and movie studios are among those pushing for the new law, saying it would limit internet companies\u2019 profiting off unlicensed content and help content creators receive fair compensation. Technology companies and open-internet supporters argue the proposal is overly aggressive, will create unfair legal liabilities for websites large and small, and will ultimately limit the information available online.\n\u2014 Adam Satariano\nENVIRONMENT\nAbout 4,500 governors, mayors, business executives and community leaders are set to meet in San Francisco for an international gathering on climate change beginning on Wednesday.The Global Climate Action Summit, which includes Gov. Jerry Brown of California and Michael Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York as hosts, is a response to a United Nations request for renewed efforts to curb emissions following theParis climate agreement.\nDuring the three-day summit, attendees plan to announce new electric vehicle programs, energy storage projects and other initiatives. Some American cities and states have committed to the Paris accord despite President Trump\u2019s announced intention to withdraw from it.\n\u2014 Ivan Penn\nECONOMY\nTrade tensions will most likely be a key issue when Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, holds anews conference on Thursdayafter a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council. The bank is not expected to make any major changes in policy, but its economists will issue their latest forecasts. Those should give an indication of how much the central bank believes thatthe trade warwith the United States is hurting the eurozone economy.\n\u2014 Jack Ewing\nECONOMY\nThe Bank of England raised its benchmark interest rate inAugust to 0.75 percent, its highest level since February 2009. Policymakers at the central bank will meet on Thursday, but are unlikely to raise rates again. They are more likely to do so later this year, but that would depend on how the economy fares and how expectations for inflation change as Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union draws closer. With Brexit looming, questions have been raised about whether Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, willextend his time there. \u201cI am willing to do whatever else I can to ensure a smooth Brexit and an effective transition,\u201d Mr. Carney told British lawmakers at aTreasury Select Committeeon Tuesday.\n\u2014 Amie Tsang\nECONOMY\nOn Thursday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department willrelease the latest readingon theConsumer Price Indexfor August.

That would bring the year-over-year increase in prices to 2.8 percent.\n\u2014 Nelson D. Schwartz\nRETAIL INDUSTRY\nRetail sales figures, which the Census Bureau is scheduled to release on Friday, will be a good barometer of whether the solid economy is continuing to inspire Americans to open up their wallets and shop. This summer retailers have reported some of theirbest sales growthsince the 2008 recession, reflecting a strong job market and areordering in the retail industryafter a wave of bankruptcies and store closures.\n\u2014 Michael Corkery"
