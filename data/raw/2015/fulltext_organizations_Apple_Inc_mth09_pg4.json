        "title": "Apple Delays Release of New Apple Watch Software",
        "fulltext": "Apple postponed the release of a software update to the Apple Watch, the smartwatch it released to much fanfare, and skepticism, earlier this year.\nThe company said that it found a flaw in the software, called watchOS 2, which had been scheduled for release on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected. We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly,\u201d a spokesperson for Apple said in a statement.\nThe company did not elaborate on the bug, nor on the length of the delay. The new software is meant to add a few new capabilities to the Apple Watch, including the ability for developers to build more powerful apps,\n                                        a feature that lets users reply to email directly from the device and a couple of new digital watch faces.\nApple held a big product event last week in San Francisco, at which Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, unveiled new luxury wristbands for the smartwatch, among a host of other product upgrades. The\n                                        watch is the first brand new product that Apple has introduced under Mr. Cook, and the company set expectations relatively low for sales of the device by deciding not to break out sales figures for the watch.\nIn July when Apple reported quarterly financial results, analysts estimated the company had sold between 1.5 million and three million watches, which was less than the three million to five million watches they had\n                                        predicted ahead of the earnings report. In a conference call at the time, Mr. Cook said the gadget had had \u201ca great start.\u201d"

        "title": "Enabling of Ad Blocking in Apple\u2019s iOS 9 Prompts Backlash",
        "fulltext": "For years, people have longed for ways to stop advertising from popping up on their iPhones and iPads. Now, software to block ads on these gadgets has arrived \u2014 and the harsh realities of the practice are causing second thoughts.\nJust two days after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps through itsnew mobile operating system, iOS 9, users are embracing the new technology after long complaining that the ads track them, slow down web browsers and are just plain annoying. In less than 48 hours, several ad-blocking apps with names like Peace, Purify and Crystal soared to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store chart.\nYet some web publishers are now fretting that ads on their sites can\u2019t be viewed because of the blockers, which could threaten these publishers\u2019 livelihoods. On Friday, the maker of the $3 ad-blocking app Peace, Marco Arment,removed his programfrom the App Store and offered refunds, saying that while stopping ads does \u201cbenefit a ton of people in major ways, they also hurt some, including many who don\u2019t deserve to be hit.\u201d\nThis about-face highlights the complexities aroundthe ethics of ad blocking. Advertising underlies much of the Internet, making it possible for people to make a living off the Internet and create the content that users consume. By limiting ads, that implicit contract was violated, some publishers and advertisers said. More distinctions now need to be made around what qualifies as \u201cgood\u201d online advertising versus \u201cbad\u201d ads that should be blocked, they said \u2014 though they were less clear on who would decide what constitutes a good or bad ad.\n\u201cWhen ad blockers became the most downloaded apps in the App Store, it forced publishers and advertisers to rethink the role that advertising plays on the web,\u201d said David Carroll, an associate professor of media design at the Parsons School of Design.\nAn Apple spokeswoman said that Apple enabled ad blocking in the new version of its mobile software to give customers the option to block content \u201cfor an improved mobile browsing experience.\u201d\nAd blocking is not new; people have been able to use ad-blockers on their desktop web browsers for some time. But the number of people installing ad blockers has increased with the arrival of blockers on mobile devices because so much computing has now moved to those devices.\nThat means the potential for ad blocking to dent revenue for websites and advertisers is increasing. About 16 percent of those who use the Internet in the United States, or 45 million people, have already installed an ad blocker, up 48 percent over the last 12 months, said Sean Blanchfield, who runs PageFair, an Irish start-up that tracks ad blocking. Ina reportlast month, Adobe and PageFair calculated that blockers would cost publishers nearly $22 billion in revenue in 2015.\nThe potential toll of ad blocking has become particularly apparent over the last few days, when several website publishers got caught in the dragnet after Apple enabled ad-blocking apps. John Gruber, a technology blogger who publishes on his site Daring Fireball, posted on Twitter that \u201cit\u2019s wrong\u201d if an ad blocker stops all types of ads.\n\"The ad network I\u2019m a part of, the Deck, only serves ads that are fast to load and don\u2019t track you,\" Mr. Gruber said. \u201cIn my opinion, they\u2019re good-looking ads for high-quality products and services. Why block that?\"\nMichael Macher, publisher of the online publication The Awl, said in anarticlethat ran on his site that 75 to 85 percent of the site\u2019s revenue could be blocked by ad blockers.\nMr. Macher did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cThis will be hard on small publishers,\u201d said David Jacobs, chief executive of 29th Street Publishing, which helps publishers create apps. \u201cThere are definitely some small publishers out there that make 50 percent to 75 percent of their revenue from ads, and they have margins of about 10 percent.\u201d\nHe added that some \u201cpublishers will really need another way to make money\u201d and that readers should think about what\u2019s happening and how they get a lot of content free. \u201cI think that people have also underestimated how much has to change between the reader and publishers,\u201d he said.\nThe reaction by publishers has created blowback for some makers of ad-blocking software. Mr. Arment\u2019s app Peace, for instance, faced criticism because it treated all ads the same by blocking all of them. Blocking all ads is an approach that \u201cis too blunt,\u201d Mr. Arment wrote in a blog post. \u201cPeace required that all ads be treated the same \u2014 all-or-nothing enforcement for decisions that aren\u2019t black and white. If we\u2019re going to effect positive change over all, a more nuanced, complex approach is required.\u201d\nMr. Arment did not respond to a request for comment.\nOver time, the kinds of ad blockers on mobile devices may change, said Mr. Carroll of the Parsons School of Design. While many ad-blocking apps are now basically cudgels that obstruct all ads, he said he expected there would later be \u201ccustomizable, free ad blockers with a feature that offers a whitelist for some ads.\u201d Whitelists are a list of approved ads that could get past the blocker.\nOthers in the online ad industry say they see the explosion of ad blocking as an opportunity to fix a broken system of intrusive, data-heavy ads that slow down the browsing experience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a new conversation about creating a quality environment for consumers, particularly on mobile devices,\u201d said John Montgomery, chairman of WPP\u2019s GroupM Connect in North America. \u201cI think we should all look at it as an area of concern and deep interest.\u201d\nAd-technology companies like Rubicon Project said they were now working to make the technology behind ads better and less burdensome.\n\u201cIn ad tech, we tend to look at this as an opportunity to address the core issue, which is making the user experience better,\u201d Neal Richter, Rubicon\u2019s chief technology officer, said in a recent interview."

        "title": "Review: Different Thinking About Steve Jobs, the Man Behind Apple",
        "fulltext": "The transformative impact Steve Jobs has had on culture and society has become an article of faith since his much-mourneddeath in 2011. The secular canonization of Mr. Jobs, the mastermind behind Apple, is the starting point for \u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\u201d Alex Gibney\u2019s trenchant new documentary, which asks with sincere curiosity: What\u2019s the fuss about? And more to the point: What\u2019s wrong with this picture?\nMr. Gibney, a prolific documentarian, not only charts Mr. Jobs\u2019s extraordinary record of marketing and innovation, but also presents a merciless anatomy of a complicated public character. Mr. Jobs has already been the subject of dueling books, and will beincarnated by Michael Fassbenderin a film this fall. But Mr. Gibney has produced his own penetrating cultural commentary amid the smorgasbord of interviews and archival Jobsiana, braiding together tough questions about the particular modern world Mr. Jobs helped create.\ntranscript\nNA\nThat world begins, in time-honored tech-world fashion, with the origin myth of Apple in the hacker days ofSteve Wozniakand Mr. Jobs in the 1970s. Even here Mr. Gibney takes a moment to note how Mr. Jobs shortchanged Mr. Wozniak out of some money in a programming gig before hitching the story to Mr. Jobs\u2019s boundless ambition and ability to make computing cool (and, later, normative). The hit parade follows: the first Mac revolution; Mr. Jobs\u2019s departure from Apple in 1985; and the return of the king, with all the triumphant toys and i-candy that followed \u2014 Macs, iPods, iPhones, iPads.\nRuthless, canny and tenacious, Mr. Jobs emerges as a formidable captain of industry in the vein of past fierce innovator-businessmen like Thomas Edison, with a Svengali\u2019s coal-eyed stare to boot. Former associates and an ex-wife are on hand to marvel, gripe and even weep. Yet as frequent shots of peaceful Japanese gardens remind us, Mr. Jobs was also way into Zen \u2014 or at least a certain interpretation of Zen that, as Mr. Gibney underlines, yielded the focus of a monk but not the empathy.\nThat disconnect, Mr. Gibney suggests, is echoed elsewhere in the Apple endeavor. His questioning voice-over repeatedly steps in to give a reality check to the high-flying story of best-selling products and core company values. Soon after recognizing the iPhone as a milestone, Mr. Gibney surveys Apple and Mr. Jobs\u2019s less savory activity: backdated stock options, huge overseas tax shelters, scandalous Chinese factories and retaliatory police investigations.\nMr. Gibney\u2019s film is a chunky mix, with a-little-too-proudly-rolled-out pop songs (even though they partly serve to echo Mr. Jobs\u2019s self-regard). But even if this isn\u2019t the iPhone of documentaries, it gets its point across, and unlike Mr. Gibney\u2019s Scientology expos\u00e9 \u201cGoing Clear,\u201d this movie has a harder target (albeit with its own devoted following). He also brings out the uncanny details that help rediscover the strangeness of widespread cultural changes. When Mr. Jobs is reported to seethe at the news that he has fathered a child by his girlfriend, Mr. Gibney segues into the unveiling of Mr. Jobs\u2019s apparently preferred offspring \u2014 a new Mac \u2014 suggesting some god-player figure out of science fiction.\nBy the end, Mr. Gibney has also skewered Apple\u2019s marketing of its consumer devices as a form of creative expression (\u201cThink Different\u201d), and has drawn out the dissonance between that individuality and the danger of self-absorption. While his conclusion verges on a public awareness announcement, he re-evaluates Mr. Jobs and elucidates a cultural technological landscape that is too often taken for granted.\n\u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine\u201d is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Strong language."

        "title": "With a Revamped Apple TV, Company Hopes to Camp in Your Home",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Appleis finally getting serious about pushing into our living rooms.\nThat ambition will be underlined at an Apple event in San Francisco on Wednesday, when the company plans to unveil an upgraded Apple TV, a device similar to a set-top box that brings video and music from the Internet to a television, according to people briefed on the product.\nThe upgrade, the first in three years, will expand Apple TV\u2019s uses in gaming, including a redesigned remote control witha touch padthat can double as a game controller, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Importantly, the new device will include support for apps and games made by independent software developers.\nThe revamped device will share the event spotlight with Apple\u2019s biggest moneymaker, theiPhone. The company once called Apple TV a \u201chobby,\u201d as it accounts for less than 5 percent of sales, so the prominent billing this time highlights the aim of transforming the device into a multipurpose entertainment product for homes.\nThe move will thrust Apple deeper into a competitive market where few, including Apple, have made headway. While the living room has been something of a holy grail for many tech companies, with Sony rolling out its PlayStation game console, Microsoft its Xbox console and Amazon its home devices like the Amazon Echo, few can claim to have become the go-to for online services in residences.\nApple TV itself has long languished. Apple unveiled the product in 2007, but its offerings were not as thorough as what people could get with cable subscriptions. A recent Forrester Research survey found that only 19 percent of online adults in the United States were interested in or already used an Apple TV.\n\u201cThe most important thing about the Apple TV announcement is it becomes a broader utility box,\u201d said Peter Csathy, the chief executive of the media consulting firm Manatt Digital Media. \u201cThen it can ultimately become the Trojan horse for all kinds of services in the home that, in turn, let Apple sell more hardware.\u201d\nApple declined to comment on the new Apple TV or other details of the coming event. Several online publications earlier reported onthe Apple TVandother productsexpected on Wednesday.\nBuilding up more of a presence in the home is important for Apple as it seeks growth from new avenues. The company relies on the iPhone for the majority of its revenue and profit, and Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has broadened product lines into wearables with theApple Watchand new services such asApple PayandApple Music. More diversification gives Apple a large number of ways to hook customers into its ecosystem of products, software and services.\nFor years, Apple focused more on partnerships with TV studios and other content makers to bring programs to Apple TV and its mobile devices. The company this year announced an exclusive deal with HBO to bring HBO Now, an app that lets usersstream HBO\u2019s programmingwithout a cable subscription, to the iPhone,iPadand Apple TV. Apple has also held talks with several leading television groups to offer an Internet-based TV service for its iPhone, iPad andAppleTV, but the service will not be ready for an announcement next week, according to people briefed on the talks.\nApple also hinted at more serious television ambitions in 2013 when it hired a Hulu executive, Pete Distad, to work on Apple TV. At Hulu, Mr. Distad oversaw content distribution and subscription initiatives.\nNow the focus has expanded to more than TV content. The Apple TV\u2019s support for apps and games made by third-party software developers as well as the redesigned remote control could broaden the device\u2019s appeal to make it more of a competitor to the Xbox, the PlayStation and the Nintendo Wii U.\n\u201cMore interesting than content deals is what happens in the app store,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. \u201cNow that Apple TV is a software development platform, developers can now write for a 40-inch screen. That will immediately bring more interesting content and apps to the device, which is at this point more compelling than trying to cut a bunch of content deals.\u201d\nApple is also raising the price of the device to $149 from $69, which puts pressure on the company to deliver expanded capabilities that go beyond what Apple TV and its rivals now offer.\nAll of this doesn\u2019t mean that Apple won\u2019t also focus on the iPhone on Wednesday. As is now tradition each September, the company plans to introduce new versions of the smartphone, with a higher-quality camera and a capability known as Force Touch, which lets users control some of the software by exerting pressure on the touch screen, according to people with knowledge of the products.\nApple will also showcase updated iPads, according to a person briefed on the product. And the company is putting the finishing touches on a revamped iPad keyboard that may be available by the end of the year.\nOther products that may surface include new metal finishes for the Apple Watch, including a less expensive gold version, people close to the product said. In addition, Apple is set to release iOS 9, the next version of its mobile operating system, which will include improved search capabilities with Siri, the voice assistant, among other features.\nApple may also pull out \u201cone more thing,\u201d as the company\u2019s co-founder, Steve Jobs, was fond of doing.\nThis time, there is a chance that attendees will be treated to something special in how the products are presented because Apple is holding its event in the 6,000-seat Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. The space is much larger than many other places the company has chosen for product introductions. The choice has some wondering whether Apple could have a much more immersive experience in store for attendees."

        "title": "Answers to Questions About Apple\u2019s New Products",
        "fulltext": "We asked readers to send us questions about Apple\u2019s new products on Wednesday when the companyunveiled updated iPhones, a bigger iPad, an upgraded Apple TV and accessories. Many readers had queries about the new devices and how they work. Brian X. Chen and J.\u2009D. Biersdorfer answered the most frequently asked ones.\nQ.There is a slight width difference of a couple of millimeters with the new iPhones versus the old ones. Will this affect cases? \u2014 Brooks Hanley, Petaluma, Calif.\nBrianThe increases in thickness and width compared to the previous iPhones are minor.\nSome case makers, like Speck, have said that the newiPhone 6S will fitinside their iPhone 6 cases. However, it\u2019s unsafe to conclude that all iPhone 6 cases will be able to fit the new iPhones, because hundreds of cases are on the market. Your best bet is to look up the website for your case\u2019s brand and contact its customer support to ask whether the cases will be compatible with the new iPhones.\nQ.Can Apple TV replace my Comcast cable box with DVR? If so, will I get all the stations I get now? \u2014 Ted David, Ocean County, N.J.\nJ.D.Don\u2019t cancel your cable television subscription yet.Apple TVis not a complete replacement for cable service but more of an enhancement to it. Like earlier versions of the little black set-top box, it provides dozens of channel apps to choose from, like those for ABC and Fox, but if youread the fine print at the bottom of the page, Apple notes that many channels are \u201cfree with your subscription through participating cable and satellite providers.\u201d And of course, you may need a subscription for premium services like HBO.\nTo see the content on these types of apps, sign up for a user name and password from your cable provider, and use those credentials when the big login box pops up on the TV screen. You can, however,subscribe directly to the HBO Nowservice on the Apple TV even if your cable package does not include HBO; the stand-alone HBO service here is $15 a month after the free trial period. Still, you can find plenty of free content on the Apple TV, including PBS shows and video podcasts \u2014 and you can watch pretty much anything you\u2019ve bought from the iTunes Store on there, too.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said the company believes\u201cthe future of TV is apps\u201dand perhaps a real cord-cutting app likeSling TV\u2019s monthly $20 packageof selected broadcast and cable channels is not far down the road. A cloud-based DVR to go with that would be on my wish list, too.\nQ.Any word on an OS X update? My Safari is breaking down and I\u2019ve been waiting for El Capitan. \u2014 Nelson Alexander, New York\nBrianApple did not explicitly say anything on Wednesday about El Capitan, the next version of Mac OS X. But it quietly updated the webpage for OS X with a message that reads \u201cComing September 30.\u201d That\u2019s a bit later than the Sept. 16 release date for iOS 9, the mobile operating system, but it still gives Apple time to target the back-to-school season and the holiday shopping season, which is when Mac sales heat up.\nQ.How does the new iPad Pro differentiate itself from the MacBook Pro? \u2014 Quentin Nie, Hong Kong\nJ.D.TheiPad Proand theMacBook Procan share information by way ofiCloudorthe USB cable that works with its Lightning port, but they are different devices for different styles of working. (The prices for the two are also different,about $800for the low-end iPad Pro with its 12.9-inch screen versusabout $1,100for the starter model MacBook Pro with its 13-inch screen.)\nThe iPad Pro, while bigger, shinier and more robust than its iPad ancestors, is still a tablet thatruns on an A9X processorand Apple\u2019s iOS operating system for mobile gadgets. The iPad Pro also runs apps specifically designed for iOS, but at least there are850,000 of themto choose from.\nIf you opt for a model that includes cellular service, you also have an Internet connection without having to hunt around for a Wi-Fi network or an Ethernet jack as you have to do to get most laptops online. The light weight and easy connectivity make the iPad Pro (or any cellular-equipped iPad) a useful tool for computing on the go. If you don\u2019t like typing on glass, you can even turn the iPad Pro into a sort of laptop-on-the-accessories-installment-plan by buying theoptional Smart Keyboardfor an additional $169 \u2014 which gives you a tactile keyboard and a place to prop up the tablet so you can better see what you\u2019re typing.\nThe MacBook Pro may be heavier, but it\u2019s intended for more heavy-duty computing, running on Intel dual or quad-core processors. For input, the laptop comes with its own keyboard and track pad, and you can always use a mouse. It has USB, HDMI and Thunderbolt ports for attaching accessories, as well as a built-in slot for Secure Digital memory cards. You get far more onboard storage space \u2014 on a MacBook Pro,you can get up to 512 gigabyteson the base models; but you can go up to a full terabyte by paying more. The iPad Protops out at 128 gigabytes, minus what iOS takes up.\nSpeaking of operating systems, the MacBook Pro runsthe OS X operating system(not iOS) and all the programs and apps written specifically for it.\nQ.Can I use Apple TV to mirror my iPad 3 onto my new 2015 Samsung smart TV? Samsung software for this doesn\u2019t work. Navigating the iPad is much easier than navigating on the TV. \u2014 Morgan Sundance, Florida\nBrianYes. The new Apple TV supports AirPlay, the feature used to stream content wirelessly from iPhones and iPads to the Apple TV. The iPad 3 includes support for AirPlay, so you should be fine.\nQ.Does the iPad Pro have a flash drive or a means to transfer documents from one device to another, as is the case with Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro? \u2014 Francys, Washington\nJ.D.The iPad Pro does not have the USB connector needed to attach a standard USB driveas you can do with one of Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro tabletsto move files between devices. Cloud services that make iOS apps (likeDropbox, Microsoft\u2019sOneDrive,Google Drive, Apple\u2019s owniCloudand so on) are still probably the most convenient way to pass files back and forth between devices if you don\u2019t want to bother with emailing them to yourself.\nAs with other iPads, the iPad Pro has the Lightning port for charging and transferring some types of data (likeiTunes purchasesoriWork files) from the computer through the cable that links the Lightning port to the USB port on a Mac or Windows PC. But the iPad Pro also has a new port called the Smart Connector that can transfer power and data to the tablet. Apple\u2019s new Smart Keyboard uses the new port, and other companies likeLogitechare building accessories that work with the Smart Connector, so some sort of smart dock with a USB port may be feasible if Apple approves.\nApple does sell accessories for its Lightning port, like the $29Lightning to USB Camera Adapter, but it\u2019s mainly intended for attaching a camera\u2019s USB cable to import photos and videos. The results have been mixed, butsome brave souls have experimentedwith attaching flash drives to the iPad that way.\nQ.Any news on better battery life or increased battery size in the 6S compared to the 6? I\u2019d rather have a thicker phone than a thin one that has no battery life. \u2014 BB, New York\nBrianApple\u2019s reported battery life for both the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus are identical, respectively, to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. But the new phones are slightly thicker than the previous ones and my guess is that is because the phones are more powerful (70 percent faster than the previous generation) and the camera is also a big improvement. Apple\u2019s website says the iPhone 6S has a battery life that will support talk time of as much as 14 hours on a 3G network, while the iPhone 6S Plus has battery life to support as much as 24 hours on 3G.\nQ.Does the new iPad Pro have 3D Touch? \u2014 Andrew Bavetta, Truckee, Calif.\nJ.D.No. Apple\u2019s3D Touchfeature \u2014 which senses how much pressure you are applying to the screen and reacts accordingly with different actions and menus \u2014 is available only on the newiPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus. But Apple has a history of putting features into its iPhones first (think cameras, Siri, Touch ID) and then adding them to future generations of iPads, so maybe 3D Touch will turn up in a later model. Until then, iPad Pro users can vary their touch on the tablet with anoptional Apple Pencil.\nQ.Can 16GB on the new iPhone accommodate the new camera features? It\u2019s too little on my 4S, so I guess my real question is, how does Apple justify this? 16GB is so insulting, that model should be free. \u2014 A. Coates, Brooklyn\nBrianI highly recommend against buying the 16-gigabyte model ($650). It\u2019s questionable why Apple continues to release an iPhone with so little storage in this day and age. Even light technology users who aren\u2019t constantly downloading new apps or taking that many photos will burn through 16 gigabytes quickly, especially with the new 12-megapixel camera. From a business perspective, Apple may be trying to encourage consumers to pay the extra $100 for the 64-gigabyte model because it offers so much more value.\nQ.Will the Apple Pencil work on older iPad models or only the iPad Pro? \u2014 Daren Woodward, The Bronx\nJ.D.The $100 battery-powered Apple Pencil is specifically designed to work with the technology under the hood of the iPad Pro. An Apple representative told my colleague that the new stylus was not compatible with older models. If Apple declines to make its own stylus for its older iPad models, other companies have stepped up already.\nWacom\u2019s Bamboo Fineline 2for iPad (andcompatible apps) are just $60, for example, and its basicBamboo Solostylus (which is less tied to specific drawing and note-taking apps) is around $20. The $50Jot Dashand the $25Hand Stylusare among the other fancy options for iPad writing sticks, and you can find cheap, simple styluses around the web for as little as $5. Many of these alternatives work on any touch screen, including iPhones and iPod Touch players \u2014 and even Android or Windows phones and tablets.\nQ.How can I get a manual to teach me how to use this thing? \u2014 Beverly Hayes, Vallejo, Calif.\nJ.D.Apple obviously takes great pride in the elegant packaging for its products, but those sleek boxes rarely have room for anything more than a little card of setup information. So visit theApple Supportsite and scroll down to the thing you just bought \u2014iPhones,iPads, theApple TVand theApple Watchare all covered. (Note, though, that Apple doesn\u2019t generally put up the guides to new products until those products are officially released.)\nOn each product\u2019s page, you should see links to an online help guide, and often PDF files that you can get free from the site. The current Apple Watch User Guide, for example, is available as a96-page PDF fileyou can download and print out, or asa free iBookto read on your preferred iOS device. Apple\u2019s site has a whole page of links tomanuals for its products,and you can evenfind help in other languages."

Jobs, once announced that using a stylus with a computing device was pass\u00e9. But guess what? The company is now offering a stylus, called Apple Pencil, for $100.\nAnd in a move sure to make Apple old-timers squirm, the newest version of theiPad, which has an optional keyboard that attaches to the tablet, is even imitating some of the features of Microsoft\u2019s competing product, called the Surface.\nTogether, the tablet, stylus and keyboard make for a combination computing device that Apple executives had long said that they wouldn\u2019t create, perhaps indicating the people running the company today are willing to forget about the past as they try to cater to shifting consumer tastes.\nBut the center of this ever-expanding Silicon Valley giant is still theiPhone, which accounts for 56 percent of Apple\u2019s profits. And in a presentation that lasted more than two hours on Wednesday at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium here, Apple executives emphasized several new iPhone features that \u2014 despite other announcements, ranging from an improved version of the company\u2019s television controller to chic watchbands \u2014 are still the key to Apple\u2019s success.\n\u201cInvestors have been rewarded by assuming Apple can continually push the envelope on what a phone and the company can do,\u201d said Michael A. Sansoterra, the chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management, which owns Apple stock.\nBecause of the first iteration of the larger-screen iPhone 6 introduced last year, Apple\u2019s fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, when the company had an $18 billion profit, was the most profitable quarter ever for a publicly traded company.\nBut meeting expectations is becoming a bigger challenge. In its most recent quarter, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $49.6 billion and a $10.7 billion profit; iPhone revenue was up 59 percent from the previous year. But those results still fell short of Wall Street estimates, and Apple\u2019s share price tumbled 4 percent in the following day of trading.\nApple will hit this holiday shopping season with the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which include an upgraded, 12-megapixel camera and a new capability called 3D Touch. It can sense how hard a user is pressing a button, allowing for easier access to different menus and information. It also gives users tactile feedback when they touch their screens. Pressure-sensitive touch screens are already available on the Apple Watch and in the trackpad of the new MacBook.\nThe new iPhones will also come in a rose-gold finish, with a new glass that the company describes as the strongest in the industry.\nThe phone\u2019s touch ID sensor has been upgraded, and the phone will feature iOS 9, the newest version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system.\nThe new iPhone 6S will cost $200, and the iPhone 6S Plus will cost $300 with a phone contract. Prices for previous versions of the iPhone will drop by $100.\ntranscript\nNA\nApple introduced its own payment plan. Starting at $32 a month, customers can upgrade their phones every year if they buy them through Apple. The new phones will be available in 12 countries, including the United States, on Sept. 25. They will be available to order starting Sept. 12.\nBut as was clear in the presentation on Wednesday, Apple is aggressively courting customers with other product lines as it competes with competitors like Microsoft, Samsung and Google to become the centerpiece of Internet-connected home entertainment systems.\n\u201cApple gets a lot of credit for being innovators, but it\u2019s about how they execute and improve on what already exists,\u201d said Tuong Huy Nguyen, a Gartner analyst. \u201cEveryone uses the same ingredients, but a great chef can use them to make a better meal.\u201d\nThe makeover of the iPad is reminiscent of Apple\u2019s decision last year to introduce the larger-screen phones, a move that many also had said the company would never make.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, called the newiPadPro \u201cthe most capable\u201d tablet the company has ever created. With a larger screen and optional keyboard, it becomes a device that is meant to be useful for both the creation and consumption of content.\n\u201cIt makes sense for Apple to reveal a new keyboard along with new, larger-screen iPads with faster processors,\u201d said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. \u201cThe message being that Apple is trying to push the iPad to be more of a PC replacement, a converged device of a tablet notebook that has broader computing powers.\u201d\nBut starting at $800 (not including the optional $170 keyboard and the $100 stylus), it is much more expensive than earlier iPads.\nMr. Sacconaghi added that Apple had long rejected the idea that it would create such a device, but now some of the pieces are in place. The new iPad runs Microsoft Office software and has a faster processor so it can handle more complex computing tasks.\nMr. Cook also presented a new, enhanced Apple TV, which represents the company\u2019s most ambitious effort yet to become the focal point of home entertainment systems. Apple TV already streams videos and music. Now it is set to offer video games, shopping and travel tools through an expanded array of apps.\n\u201cOur vision for TV is simple,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cWe believe the future of television is apps.\u201d\nThe new version of Apple TV also includes a remote control that could be used as a video game controller. The product now comes with a higher price tag that starts at $150, up from $70, indicating that the company is betting that consumers will think all of the new features are worth the higher price.\nJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of operations, also talked about improvements to the Apple Watch, including a number of new apps like Facebook Messenger and AirStrip, a health care app that lets doctors coordinate patient care and monitor health data.\nDrawing all of these devices together is Apple\u2019s voice assistant technology, called Siri, with improved search capabilities that were prominently displayed throughout the event, especially on the new Apple TV.\n\u201cThe market will decide whether it\u2019s a good idea for Apple to do things that it has said it wouldn\u2019t or that people don\u2019t think it should,\u201d said Mr. Nguyen. \u201cSo far the market has liked it.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s iPhone Keeps Going Its Own Way",
        "fulltext": "You will hear some carping, in the coming days, about a lack of revolutionary upgrades in the newiPhone. At its media event in San Francisco on Wednesday,Appleadded just a handful of features to its latest smartphones, the 6S and 6S Plus, including a pressure-sensitive screen, better cameras and a new color \u2014 pink, or \u201cRose Gold,\u201d in Apple\u2019s marketing argot.\nIt\u2019s the same kind of carping that happens every year. The iPhone is by far Apple\u2019s most important product \u2014 it is, by most accounts, thesingle most profitable product on the planet\u2014 and for many analysts, that very significance highlights a vulnerability. So tech observersare once again wonderinghow much longer Apple can sustain the magic. Has Apple done enough to maintain its outsize lead in the industry? Can the iPhone still expect tovacuum up virtually all of the profitsin the global smartphone business?\ntranscript\nNA\nIt\u2019s time to ease off from the ritualized annual fretting about the iPhone\u2019s future. After several years of uncertainty about the iPhone\u2019s long-term prospects, it\u2019s clear that Apple has maneuvered the device into an enviable position, whatever the merits of its latest features. The iPhone\u2019s continuing dominance may not be a sure thing, but in the tech industry, it\u2019s as sure a thing as you can find right now.\nIf this doesn\u2019t surprise you, it should. In many fundamental ways, the iPhone breaks the rules of business, especially the rules of the tech business. Those rules have more or less always held that hardware devices keep getting cheaper and less profitable over time. That happens because hardware is easy to commoditize; what seems magical today is widely copied and becomes commonplace tomorrow. It happened in personal computers; it happened in servers; it happened in cameras, music players, and \u2014 despite Apple\u2019s best efforts \u2014 it may be happening in tablets.\nIn fact, commoditization has wreaked havoc in the smartphone business \u2014 just not for Apple. In the last half-decade, sales of devices running Google\u2019s Android operating system have far surpassed sales of Apple\u2019s devices, and now account for the vast majority of smartphones in use.\nFor years, observers predicted that Android\u2019s rising market share would in turn lead to lower profits for Apple (profits, not market share, being the point of business). If that had happened, it would have roughly approximated the way the Windows PC industry eclipsed Apple\u2019s Mac business. \u201cHey, Apple, wake up \u2014 it\u2019s happening again,\u201dHenry Blodget, of Business Insider,warned in 2010. Andagain in 2011,2012,2013and2014.\nNone of those predictions came true. While the iPhone\u2019s sales growth slowed in 2013 and 2014, it rebounded to near-record levels later last year, and its profits have remained lofty.\nInstead of killing Apple, commoditization caused something stranger \u2014 it hobbled Apple\u2019s main competitor in the smartphone business: Samsung, which until last year was gaining a creeping share of the profits in the smartphone business. At its peak in mid-2013, Samsung was making close to half of every dollar in the smartphone business, according tothe investment bank Canaccord. (Apple was making the other half.)\ntranscript\nNA\nBut the rise of low-end, pretty great Android phones made by Chinese upstarts like Xiaomi \u2014 and the surging popularity of Apple\u2019s large-screen iPhones \u2014put Samsung in a bind. In July, Samsung reported itsseventh straight quarter of declining profits. Canaccord\u2019s latest estimate shows Samsung making 15 percent of profits in smartphones, with Apple making 92 percent. (The numbers add up to more than 100 because everyone else in the smartphone industry loses money, so their share of the profits is negative.)\nYou can expect Apple\u2019s proportion to grow. As analysts at Credit Suisse explained in a note last week, only about 30 percent of the world\u2019s 400 million iPhone users have upgraded to the large-screen models Apple introduced last year. Apple is bound to reap more money as the majority of its users inevitably jump to big phones over the next few years. In other words, for the foreseeable future, Apple stands virtually alone: It may be the only company making any money selling phones.\nWhat\u2019s driving the iPhone\u2019s escape from the trap of commodity hardware is that it is more than a hardware device. Instead, an iPhone is a tightly integrated mix of hardware, great software, and several pretty good services rolled into a single gadget.\nApple\u2019s suite of services is far from perfect; asI\u2019ve argued before, for many people, Google offers a better range of cloud services to run on an iPhone. Still, Apple\u2019s services are good enough for most people, and as the company keeps expanding its ecosystem \u2014 covering payments and home and health devices \u2014 it will continue to build in different kinds of lock-ins for different kinds of users. Some people stay with the iPhone for its better App Store, others for iMessage, and many grandparents for FaceTime video calling and iCloud photo sharing. Just about everyone stays because they find Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system simpler to navigate, and easier to maintain, than the fragmented Android landscape. Put it all together and you get a package that few of Apple\u2019s rivals can replicate.\nBut the iPhone is not just what it does, but what it means to its users \u2014 which is directly a product of the savvy way Apple has designed and marketed the device to produce global lust. Asthe writer Ben Thompson has argued, the iPhone is in many ways a \u201cVeblen good,\u201d the economic term for a product whose high price actually increases its desirability. Apple\u2019s resistance to selling low-end phones may thus feed into its success. IPhone resellers in Asia, for example, say that for many people, lower-end iPhones \u2014 even used ones \u2014 are seen as more desirable than more powerful, brand-new, but cheaper Android devices.\nAcross large swaths of the globe, in other words, the iPhone is a status symbol, which is not to say that it\u2019s frivolous \u2014 unlike a Prada suit, the iPhone is one status symbol that you\u2019ll still find extremely useful.\nOf course, Apple\u2019s strategy is vulnerable to unpredictable shocks. Apple is betting on rising affluence across the globe to keep it in the black. If there\u2019s a slowdown in this rise \u2014 if the Chinese economy plunges, for instance, or, in the longer term, stagnant wages in Western countries push down consumers\u2019 desires to spend as freely on their phones \u2014 the iPhone will suffer. This explains whyTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive,rushed to reassure investors about the company\u2019s position in Chinaduring the recent Chinese market crisis.\nFor now, though, it\u2019s difficult to conceive of a particular way in which Apple\u2019s phone could fall to its rivals. Eight years after its introduction, the iPhone has won the biggest game in the world \u2014 and it will keep winning."

        "title": "Testing iPhone 6s\u2019s 3D Touch and Live Photos Features",
        "fulltext": "NOW that smartphones can do more than a million different things with apps, you have to wonder whether it matters whenAppleadds two main new features to its latest iPhones.\nThe answer, to cut to the chase, is yes. That\u2019s because when Apple incorporates new smartphone capabilities, the features may become widely used by consumers and then copied by rivals.\nThe trend may start again this Friday, when Apple releases theiPhone 6s and 6s Plus,part of an S generation of iPhones that are typically known as the \u201citeration\u201d cycle. In an S generation, the company improves on the last model by sprinkling in a few new features. For the iPhone 5s, for instance, it was the fingerprint sensor. For the iPhone 4s, it wasSiri, the voice assistant.\nThis time, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are being equipped with two signature new tricks: 3D Touch, in which hard or soft presses on the touch screen bring up different functions; and Live Photos, which lets you snap photos that turn into miniature videos. The iPhone also now comes in a new metallic finish, a pale pink that Apple\u2019s marketing team insists on calling \u201crose-gold.\u201d\nAfter testing the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus for two weeks, I had mixed feelings on the usefulness of the new features. I found that Live Photos quickly became an enjoyable, integral part of shooting photos with an iPhone. But I couldn\u2019t get into the habit of using 3D Touch.\nLive Photos\nLive Photos works like this: When you take a photo, you capture a still frame in full resolution. But the iPhone camera system keeps a buffer of a second and a half\u2019s worth of motion frames before and after you take the photo. So while you get a still shot of your photo, when you press down on the image, you can also get the motion frames to play back, bringing the photo to life.\nYou might wonder, why not just shoot a video? The short answer is that there will be tiny moments in life where you would never have guessed you wanted to shoot a video, and now Live Photos has a chance to capture them.\nI tried this by photographing my pets. In one instance, I captured a moment when my corgi started digging his paws into dirt on a mountain, showing a side of his personality you wouldn\u2019t witness in a normal photo.\nThere is a short learning curve for Live Photos. If you move your camera immediately before or after taking the photo, the movement will show up in the animated photo. Several of my Live Photos were ruined because I put the phone down too quickly after taking the picture. Apple said it planned to modify the feature in a software update so that it did not capture those quick movements.\nTwo other items that I\u2019d like to see addressed in future software updates: One, when Live Photos are captured, they include audio. I\u2019d like the option to disable that because images alone can speak loudly enough. You also can\u2019t edit Live Photos. You can only apply an edit to the still frame, but not the motion frames. It would be ideal to at least be able to make minor adjustments to Live Photos, like increasing brightness or contrast.\nThe major limitation of Live Photos is that only Apple devices with the latest software systems \u2014iOS 9for mobile devices, OS X El Capitan for Macs, andWatchOS 2for the Apple Watch \u2014 can see them. Apple says it is working with Facebook so users can share their Live Photos with others on the social network. Hopefully more platforms will support Live Photos in the near future.\n3D Touch\nIn interviews, Apple executives have moaned about thepainsthat engineers went through to develop 3D Touch. Pressing lightly on an email, for example, displays a \u201cpeek,\u201d or preview of the message; pressing harder opens the email. The phone also responds to your finger with a light vibration.\n3D Touch also works on app icons to get quick access to different actions. Pressing hard on the icon for the camera app gives you the options to take a selfie, shoot a video, record a slow-motion video or take a photo. You can also use 3D Touch to turn your keyboard into a trackpad to hover around a document as you would on a computer.\nIt was fun experimenting with 3D Touch, but I rarely felt compelled to use it. With my camera, my instinct continues to be to open the camera app by swiping up on the shortcut on the iPhone\u2019s lock screen. When using email, I don\u2019t bother to peek; I just open them. Unlike past touch gestures on the iPhone, like pinching or swiping, I found 3D Touch, in its current state, to be limited and mostly unnecessary.\nBut it\u2019s still early days, and 3D Touch has the potential to mature into a useful feature. Third-party companies, like Instagram and Dropbox, plan to support the feature in their iPhone apps. I would like to see Apple expand 3D Touch into other key parts of the iPhone system \u2014 for example, it would be thrilling to be able to fast-forward or rewind a video or audio recording at different speeds, depending on how hard I press down on the screen.\nBuying Advice\nSo who should buy the 6s? For owners of iPhones that are at least two years old (which includes the iPhone 5s and any generation before that), the new phones are an excellent overall upgrade. With the 6s or the 6s Plus, you\u2019re getting a screen that is significantly larger than those of the older iPhones. Also, the phone\u2019s processor, called A9, will deliver a big increase in speed.\nFor screen size, I personally prefer the 6s with a 4.7-inch screen to the 6s Plus with a 5.5-inch screen, because the smaller phone is easier to pocket and use with one hand. But people who want a smartphone that will double as a tablet, for reading books or watching videos, will be better off with the 6s Plus\u2019s larger screen.\nAnd then there\u2019s data storage. Apple offers the new iPhones with different storage options and prices: The 6s costs $650 for 16 gigabytes, $750 for 64 gigs and $850 for 128 gigs; the big-screen 6s Plus costs $100 more, respectively, for each of those storage tiers.\nI strongly recommend against the 16-gigabyte model, largely because Live Photos are twice the size of a normal photo. For just $100 more, you\u2019ll get a lot more enjoyment out of your iPhone with 64 gigs.\nFor those with an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, the new 3D Touch and Live Photos perks aren\u2019t substantive enough to make it worth upgrading to a 6s. While Apple improved the camera resolution and designed the 6s and 6s Plus with stronger metal and glass than the last iPhones, a major component \u2014 battery life \u2014 was not improved. It would be wiser to hold off until the next version, which will most likely include more significant improvements."

        "title": "Swiss Watchmakers Have One Eye on Apple",
        "fulltext": "FRANKFURT \u2014 There are lots of reasons why the Swiss watch industry has, in theory, at least, nothing to fear from the Apple Watch.\nAfter all, a $20,000 mechanical watch from Geneva is more than a way to tell the time. It is, as advertisements say, an heirloom that derives its value from aesthetics and craftsmanship, not an electronic device vulnerable to obsolescence in a few years or even a few months.\nStill, there is no doubt that Swiss watchmakers are keeping a very close eye on the smartwatch that Apple began selling in April. They are mindful of Apple\u2019s history of upending markets it has decided to focus on. And even as they reassure themselves that Apple will address a different kind of consumer, some Swiss watchmakers are readying products designed to compete.\n\u201cI have been sufficiently worried to make a connected watch,\u201d said Jean-Claude Biver, president of the watch division at LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and chief executive of its TAG Heuer brand, which plans to unveil a smartwatch in October in partnership with Google and the chip maker Intel. \u201cWe reacted very aggressively.\u201d\nBut while he takes the threat seriously, Mr. Biver insisted that the Apple Watch is more likely to help traditional timepiece makers than hurt them. Apple could help reverse a decline in watch sales among young people, he said.\n\u201cApple has such power, it will teach the younger generation to wear something on their wrists that is called a watch,\u201d Mr. Biver said by phone. \u201cWhen you teach someone to wear shoes, he will not go barefoot again.\u201d\nMr. Biver, one of the most outspoken executives in the watch industry, warned his peers not to be complacent about the Silicon Valley challenge. Apple\u2019s smartwatch has arrived as Swiss watchmakers face an array of other challenges and are particularly vulnerable.\nThe strong Swiss franc makes products from Switzerland more expensive for customers paying in United States dollars or other major currencies. Sales in key Asian markets like Hong Kong have fallen this year.\n\u201cMany brands are reacting very softly,\u201d Mr. Biver said.\nSwiss watch exports rose 3.3 percent in June, compared with a year earlier, to 1.9 billion francs, or $2 billion, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. But the pace of sales growth has been slowing since last year and is likely to be flat for all of 2015, the federation said. In May, sales fell 8.9 percent from a year earlier, a drop some attributed to the introduction of the Apple Watch a few weeks earlier.\n\u201cWe do not fear smartwatches,\u201d said Jean-Daniel Pasche, the federation\u2019s president. \u201cBut,\u201d he said in an email, \u201cwe are aware of the fact that they can also be successful.\u201d\nMr. Pasche said many people have different watches for different occasions \u2014 a functional watch for sports or an elegant one for evening events \u2014 so they just as easily might own both a smartwatch and a traditional watch. And Mr. Pasche echoed Mr. Biver\u2019s comment that rather than stealing buyers from traditional watchmakers, Apple could help get young people interested in watches.\nMr. Pasche added, \u201cOf course, we follow the development of this kind of product.\u201d\nApple has not released precise sales figures for its watch. Timothy D. Cook, the Apple chief executive,said in Julyonly that the new product was off to \u201ca great start.\u201d\nIn terms of sheer volume, Apple could soon produce more watches than all of Switzerland. Analysts estimate that Apple sold anywhere from 1.5 million to five million watches from April through June, a number that is expected to grow. In contrast, the Swiss watch industry produced an average of 2.25 million timepieces a month during the first half of this year.\nIn Europe, business managers are acutely aware of what happened to Nokia, the Finnish company that was long a showpiece of European technical savvy and business acumen. Once the dominant maker of mobile phones in the world and a pioneer in turning handsets into mobile computers, Nokia was caught unprepared by the Apple iPhone and pushed to the margins of the market. Last year Nokia sold its handset unit to Microsoft, which has struggled to gain market share and has cut thousands of jobs in Finland.\nLike Finland, whose economy suffered from its dependence on Nokia, Switzerland is susceptible to the ups and downs of the watch industry. Watches are Switzerland\u2019s third-largest export product, after chemicals and machinery, and the industry employs about 60,000 people.\n\u201cApple has this notoriety of completely disrupting industries,\u201d including the music and personal computer markets, said Tamar Koifman, lead strategist at Digital Luxury Group, a Geneva firm that does market research as well as digital advertising.\nMs. Koifman said that lower-priced watch brands like Swatch (a Swiss company), Timex and Casio were the most threatened by the Apple Watch. But she also said that higher-end brands needed to be alert.\nVersions of the Apple Watch start at $349, but the company also has taken aim at the market\u2019s upper end. The Edition line includes two $17,000 watches, one with an 18-karat yellow gold case and the other in 18-karat rose gold, which contains some copper and silver to give it a pinkish hue.\nA few other luxury watchmakers have begun to respond to Apple by incorporating smartwatch functions in traditional products. Bulgari, another LVMH brand, has been displaying at trade fairs a concept watch implanted with a chip that could be used as a digital key for electronic locks or to authenticate credit card purchases.\nMontblanc, based in Hamburg, Germany, has a watch with a digital display embedded in the strap. It offers some smartwatch functions, like flight information; the watch itself is a traditional model.\n\u201cIf you think of the wrist as a piece of real estate, there is limited real estate,\u201d Ms. Koifman said. \u201cApple Watch could grab that real estate.\u201d"
