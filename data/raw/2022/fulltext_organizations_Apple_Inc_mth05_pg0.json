        "fulltext": "Gatekeepers like powerful tech companies have a bad reputation for controlling what happens online. But they don\u2019t completely deserve the heat.\nOne of the thrills of the digital age is that individuals no longer need permission from powerful institutions. Creators of a cat tuxedo can set up shop online and don\u2019t need to persuade a big-box store to stock their product. People who witnessed an airplane\u2019s emergency landing or lived through a war can sharetheir experiencesoversocial mediarather than wait for news organizations to tell their tales.\nPeople don\u2019t have to win over record labels, book publishers or Hollywood bosses to entertain us. They can reach us directly.\nI regularly point out in On Tech that this power of the individual over the gatekeeper isonly half-true. Yes, anyone can write an app, make a new product, craft a song or share information, but the path to reaching people largely goes through Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Spotify and other powerhouses. Old dictators of information, products and entertainment may have lost influence, but in their place rose new digital gatekeepers.\nIt\u2019s a bummer, in a way, and it\u2019s one reason that technologists are gravitating to \u201cweb3,\u201d a broad term for an imagined future internet in which individuals have more control and ownership.\nToday, though, I come in praise of gatekeepers. That doesn\u2019t mean that web3 is a worthless idea or that we should bring back the old Hollywood system that decided which actors or writers could work and which were shunned.\nBut there is also real value when trusted experts decide. Perhaps one reason that gatekeepers keep re-emerging is that they can be pretty darn handy.\nApple dictates what apps you can download on your iPhone and reviews every line of software code in them. Apple is an unapologetic app gatekeeper. And while I\u2019ve written before that thedrawbacks of this approachmay now outweigh the benefits, we should acknowledge the good that comes from an institution\u2019s choosing to weed out apps that it believespromote harmful behavior, arein poor taste,rip off good ideasor try tosteal our money.\nLikewise, it can be glorious to have a choice of thousands of barbecue grills on Amazon or elsewhere online. But sometimes it can be a relief for our local Home Depot to stock just three good ones to choose from.\nBonus: Home Depot probably isn\u2019t going to sell youcounterfeit or dangerousgrills. And if it does, it may be legally liable. Amazon might not be, if the grills are sold by independent merchants that sell on Amazon like it\u2019s a flea market.\nI like being able to hear directly from politicians and corporate executives on Twitter and wading through a zillion points of view about a news event. Where else would I learn aboutRussian military truck tiresdirectly from someone with firsthand experience?\nBut there is also value when journalists carefully vet information and tell us what\u2019s important. (Feel free to disagree with this journalist about the value of journalism.)\nLucas Shaw, a Bloomberg News entertainment reporter, recentlywroteabout what he said the web3-related movements got wrong about empowering musicians or other entertainers to connect directly with fans without go-betweens like streaming services and record labels. \u201cMost musicians, actors, writers, filmmakers and creative people prefer the support of an institution with expertise,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt makes their lives easier.\u201d\nA great record label or agent can help polish a budding musician or actor, and a savvy publisher might identify book groups to spread the word about a new title. Gatekeepers charge for their expertise, but they can add more than they take.\nThis isn\u2019t universally true. Some gatekeepers are clueless or power-hungry, and some creative people don\u2019t want all this intervention. But for others, the help, as opposed to doing it all themselves, can be a blessing.\nThere are things that absolutely stink about gatekeepers, whether they\u2019re older ones like corporate news organizations and Walmart or younger ones like Apple and YouTube.\nThey make stupid decisions sometimes. They take away our choices and erode the autonomy and earnings of the people who make entertaining videos, books or cat tuxedos. Maybe web3 will end the power of the few to act as arbiters for the many, or perhaps it willconsolidate power as every tech movement has for decades.\nI hope we don\u2019t throw out what is useful about gatekeepers, though, even as we reconsider them.\nElon Musk is making some Twitter friends:A number of companies, investment funds and wealthy individuals, including Oracle\u2019s founder, Larry Ellison, and the cryptocurrency exchange Binance,committed about $7 billionto Elon Musk\u2019s purchase of Twitter, my colleague Lauren Hirsch reported. They\u2019ll become part-owners of Twitter, and the cash will reduce the size of a loan that Musk needs to help pay for the $44 billion acquisition.\nMore on Musk:My colleagues John Eligon and Lynsey Chutel report on thebackdrop of Musk\u2019s childhood in apartheid-era South Africa.\nWhen cybercriminals disrupt school:Bloomberg Newstallies the cost to schools of ransomware attacks, which involve criminals\u2019 locking institutional computer systems and data until they are paid. Lincoln College in Illinois blamed a ransomware attack and falling enrollment related to the pandemic for its decision to close next week.\nThe YouTube videos perfectly tuned to your kiddos:My colleague David Segalwritesabout the company behind \u201cCoComelon\u201d and other wildly popular children\u2019s online entertainment and the data-driven methods \u2014 including a tool called the Distractatron \u2014 that executives use to analyze what keeps young children engaged.\nIn 1984,Keanu Reeves hosted a Canadian TV news report about a teddy-bear convention.It was awesome. (Yes, it\u2019s real. The CBCdug this out of its archivesin 2020.) Thanks to my colleague Erin McCann for sharing the video.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "I Tried Apple\u2019s Self-Repair Program With My iPhone. Disaster Ensued.",
        "fulltext": "Apple last month released its firstself-repair programthat gives people access to the parts, tools and instructions to fix our own iPhones. It made waves when it wasannouncedlast year because it was a turning point for the right-to-repair movement, which has urged tech companies for more than a decade to provide resources so we can revive our electronics.\nIt was also music to my ears. As someone who became a do-it-yourselfer during the pandemic, I was excited to try Apple\u2019s new program with my iPhone.\n\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d I thought.\nVery hard, it turns out.\nFor people like me who have little experience repairing electronics, the self-repair setup was so intimidating that I nearly wussed out. It involved first placing a $1,210 hold on my credit card to rent 75 pounds of repair equipment, which arrived at my door in hard plastic cases. The process was then so unforgiving that I destroyed my iPhone screen in a split second with an irreversible error.\nThe catastrophe unfolded even though I called in an expert, Shakeel Taiyab, an independent phone repair technicianin South San Francisco, for help. After reading Apple\u2019s manuals and trying the tools with me, Mr. Taiyab said he applauded Apple for trying to empower iPhone owners but had a harsh verdict.\n\u201cThey set up the customer to fail,\u201d he said.\nThe self-repair program, I concluded, is impractical for most people. For starters, the cost of renting the equipment and purchasing parts from Apple \u2014 $96 to replace my iPhone 12\u2019s battery \u2014 was more than the $69 an Apple store charges to do the job. And as my experience shows, the process was challenging even with Apple\u2019s tools.\nApple discourages most people from trying self-repair. \u201cFor the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable repair is achieved through an Apple Store\u201d and thousands of authorized repair centers, the company said in awhite paperlast month. \u201cRepairing modern electronic devices that are complex, highly integrated and miniaturized isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\nThis raises the question of why Apple rolled out the self-repair program in the first place. It is probably no coincidence that it made the move after the Federal Trade Commission said last year that it wouldramp up enforcementagainst tech companies that made it hard for people to fix their electronics.\nAnd now, my tale of defeat.\nI started by visiting Apple\u2019s self-repair program website,selfservicerepair.com. There I found the service manual for the iPhone 12 I wanted to repair and ordered the tools. (Apple\u2019s program currently includes manuals for iPhones released in the last two years.)\nI perused the instructions for my iPhone 12, which was working fine but was probably due for a new battery. The steps seemed straightforward enough: Use a machine to melt the glue and pry off the phone\u2019s screen, remove the screws and battery, use another machine to install the new battery, then put everything back together and use a third machine to press together the phone.\nI made the charge for the self-repair program to my credit card. It included a $49 rental fee for the tool kit, the $69 battery, $2 for glue and 15 cents for some screws, along with a $1,210 hold for renting the repair machines. After seven days, those tools would have to be shipped back to Apple with a prepaid label, and the old battery could also be traded in for a $24 credit.\nWith no experience repairing phones, I decided to get some practice. I ordered a$45 kit from iFixit, a site that publishes instructions and sells D.I.Y. tools to repair gadgets, so I could first replace the battery in my wife\u2019s four-year-old iPhone XS.\nThe iFixit kit arrived with some tweezers, a screwdriver, plastic picks and a suction cup to remove the screen.\nThe process to pry open my wife\u2019s iPhone, replace the battery and reassemble the device took about five hours over two days. I ran into some snags \u2014 the iPhone wouldn\u2019t turn on, which made me think I had destroyed something. It turned out a tiny connector inside the phone was loose. When I pressed it down more firmly with my fingertip, the phone powered up and everything was back to normal.\nI was ready for the real thing, I thought.\nDays later, a UPS truck pulled up to my driveway. When the delivery man wheeled two bulky containers to my door, he asked what was inside.\n\u201cIt\u2019s equipment for people to repair their own iPhones,\u201d I said.\nHe looked incredulous.\nWhile iFixit\u2019s repair kit is lightweight, Apple\u2019s self-repair program rents out the same machines that the company\u2019s technicians use at Apple stores. That\u2019s heavy-duty gear, and when I unpacked the equipment, I had a bad feeling. The three machines \u2014 all angular and industrial \u2014 looked like serious business. I had never used anything like them before.\nSo I called Mr. Taiyab, who had fixed my family\u2019s devices in the past, and told him my conundrum. He invited me to try the machines on a spare broken phone in his office.\nSo I drove to Mr. Taiyab\u2019s office in South San Francisco with the bulky Apple machines. There, he provided a broken iPhone 12 for practice.\nThen we walked through the steps together. We removed the two external screws at the bottom of the broken iPhone 12 that helps hold the screen in place. We placed the phone into a frame that we inserted into the first machine. The machine heated up the phone to melt the glue, and a suction cup pried the screen ajar. After that, we used a plastic cutter to slice through the adhesive and remove the screen.\nFrom there, we followed the instructions on disconnecting cables and removing screws and strips of glue to extract the old battery. We breezed through this, and I was pumped.\nNow it was time to follow the same steps with my actual iPhone 12. With gusto, I loaded it into the frame and inserted it into the machine to melt the glue and begin prying off the screen.\nMr. Taiyab stopped me immediately. \u201cDid you remove the security screws?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cOh, shoot, no,\u201d I said. We backed up a few steps to remove the two tiny screws from the bottom of the phone to start over. The screen looked normal.\nWe repeated the steps to remove the battery. After installing the replacement battery, we used a roller machine to apply even pressure over the battery to glue it in place.\nNext, we used a third machine \u2014 a battery-powered press \u2014 to smush the phone together while heating up its glue to create a waterproof seal.\nFinally came the moment of truth. We plugged in the phone and powered it on. White lines flickered on the screen. It had been destroyed. Because we had not initially removed the two security screws, the screen had been held in place while I was trying to pry it open, which had caused damage.\nFortunately, Mr. Taiyab had plenty of spare Apple screens. In minutes, he took the phone apart again, replaced the screen and sealed it back up. I watched sheepishly.\nTo my surprise, the final steps were the most infuriating. When we powered on the phone again, a warning message said the battery and screen had been replaced with unknown parts. This was annoying because the battery was a genuine part ordered from Apple. The screen was also authentic, because it came from another iPhone.\nYet to finish the repair, Apple requires anyone who uses the self-repair program to run a \u201csystem configuration,\u201d which involves calling a remote customer support representative to confirm the serial number of the part and pair it with the phone. Only then is the repair authenticated, which makes the warning message disappear.\nApple\u2019s self-repair website directed me to an online app to chat with a representative. There, a worker named Carlos asked me to plug in the phone and press and hold three buttons to go into a diagnostics mode.\nI tried this step several times. Nothing happened.\nCarlos pasted the same instruction with the buttons. I tried again. Then again. Only after consulting an online forum where someone had published a different step was I able to start diagnostics mode.\nMore than 30 minutes later, we were done. The warning message about the unknown battery went away.\nApple said it welcomed feedback as it continued evolving the self-repair program. So here\u2019s mine. Like any new tech gizmo, this program is a fledgling product with pros and cons and the potential to be much better.\nThere are some benefits that will lead to higher-quality, cheaper repairs for everyone. Now all independent repair technicians, including Mr. Taiyab, have access to Apple\u2019s tools. (He said he would probably buy Apple\u2019s press for sealing up iPhones.) And everyone can now read the official instructions on how to do repairs, which eliminates guesswork.\nBut the entire experience was far from simple, and even for those who try, Apple exerts too much control by requiring approval of its repairs. If we install Apple parts, like a working screen taken from another iPhone, they should work \u2014 period.\nTo this day, I still get a warning about an unknown part on my iPhone because the new screen came from Mr. Taiyab, not Apple. Just what I needed to remind me of this repair experience."

        "fulltext": "(Want to get this newsletter in your inbox? Here\u2019sthe sign-up.)\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest at the end of Wednesday.\n1. Republicans blocked a Senate bill to protect abortion.Thevote was 51 opposed and 49 in favor, well short of the 60 votes needed for it to pass.\nRepublicans were joined by one Democrat,Senator Joe Manchinof West Virginia. The billwould have secured abortion access nationwideand prohibited multiple abortion restrictions. The vote came after a leaked Supreme Court opinion indicated that the court would overturn Roe v. Wade.More than half of women in the U.S.live in states that may ban or further restrict access to abortion if Roe is overturned.\nThe vote was a forgone conclusion, but Democrats wanted toportray Republicans as extremistsin advance of November elections. The two Senate Republicans who support abortion rights, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska,have their own bill.\n2. Consumer prices are still rising fast,though inflation has flattened slightly.\nThe Consumer Price Index wasup by 8.3 percent in April, a new report found. Inflation moderated by a small amount for the first time in months, partly because gas prices dropped. But core inflation, a measure of where inflation is headed, increased.\nFood pricesalso rose sharply last month. President Biden, touring an Illinois farm, called inflation his\u201ctop economic priority.\u201dHe said his administration would offer more insurance to farmers who planted a second crop in a year, help farmers access technology that reduces the need for fertilizers and double federal investment in fertilizer production.\nStocks fellon the mixed inflation report. Consider this advice fromour Strategies columnist.\n3. E.U. talks over a bid for a continentwide Russian oil embargobroke off today after Hungarian opposition.\nViktor Orban,Hungary\u2019s far-right prime minister, has argued that a ban on Russian oil will devastate his country. Some analysts fearWestern unity may fractureas the war drags on: While Europe continues to support the U.S.,some of its countriesdon\u2019t want a long war that might escalate and are focused on a cease-fire and a Russian troop withdrawal from Ukraine.\nVladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, may be hoping simply to outlast the West, which is beleaguered by inflation, energy disruptions, depleted public finances and a pandemic. A former U.S. ambassador to Russia admitted that he was worried \u201cabout Western fatigue, which is why the leaders of the free world should do more now to hasten the end of the war.\u201d\nFor those interested in helpingUkrainian refugees, we have a \u201cvoluntourism\u201d guide.\n4. Drug overdose deaths continued to reach record-breaking levels in 2021.\nAnearly 15 percent increase in such deathsfollowed a steeper surge of almost 30 percent in 2020, according to preliminary C.D.C. data. Almost 108,000 people overdosed in 2021. Deaths involving synthetic opioids \u2014 largely fentanyl \u2014 rose to 71,000 from 58,000, while those associated with stimulants like methamphetamine grew to 33,000 from 25,000.\nExperts said that social isolation and economic dislocation from the pandemic did not fully explain the increase. The supply of fentanyl, which can be made in a lab, has risen significantly, pushing other drugs out of the market with its low cost.\n5. Anxious parents are strugglingwith a baby formula shortage.\nThe out-of-stock rate for formulareached 43 percent last week. In San Antonio, Texas, 56 percent of normal supplies were out of stock as of Tuesday. Many mothers, dependent on formula because of health issues or jobs in which they cannot breastfeed, say they are rationing. Some have driven hours only to find empty shelves. Online, private sellers are gouging prices.\nThe shortagebecame acutethis year with arecall of a defective brandand was worsened by supply chain woes and labor shortages. The F.D.A. said officials were working with Abbott Nutrition, the company involved in the recall, to restart production.\nWhen the pandemic hit,working mothersmostly stayed on the job, new reports show, and college graduates with babies and toddlers became significantly morelikely to work.\n6. In Nebraska and West Virginia primaries,candidates endorsed by Donald Trump had a mixed scorecard yesterday.\nIn theWest Virginia Republican primary, Representative Alex Mooney, backed by Trump, trounced Representative David McKinley, whom Mooney painted as a supporter of Biden\u2019s \u201ctrillion-dollar spending spree.\u201d In Nebraska, Charles Herbster made Trumpa pillar of his campaign for governorbutlost to Jim Pillen, a University of Nebraska regent with establishment support.\nNext week: Pennsylvania will hold its Senate Democratic primary asDemocrats wrestlewith anextremely challenging environment.Kathy Barnette, who has pulled into contention with Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Republican Senate primary, won last-minute backing from the Club for Growth.\nIn other political news,Hunter Biden has turned to a Hollywood lawyerfor money and counsel, and White House allies are concerned.\nAnd a New York State judgereleased Trump from a judicial orderholding him in contempt of court.\n7. For pot dealers who want to go legal, it\u2019s complicated.\nLou Cantillo and Byron Bronson sold pot independently until meeting in 2013. They now run Buddy\u2019s Bodega, a prominent illicit cannabis wholesale business in the New York City area. But New York legalized pot last year and the twohope to go legalsoon.\nThey\u2019ll face start-up costs, high taxes, administrative demands and competition from big-money players. Buddy\u2019s, for instance, sells buzzy California designer strains. But legal dealers can\u2019t peddle out-of-state products while marijuana is federally banned. Will it all be worth it, Bronson wonders, if the company goes from \u201chaving the best weed in the world to the worst weed in the world\u201d?\n8. A Times Magazine writer tried a diet app.He lost weight \u2014 but kept his inner \u201cFat Sam.\u201d\nMy colleague Sam Anderson was the \u201cfat kid.\u201d By high school, he had slimmed down and become a decent athlete. But like many Americans, he dealt with pandemic anxiety by snacking. That led to \u201ca muffin top, moobs and \u2014 most especially \u2014 love handles.\u201d\nJarred by a shopkeeper who looked him over and confided he himself had used an app to lose pandemic weight, Sam downloaded Noom.His articletracks his journey using the app. Spoiler: Sam\u2019s pounds are gone. \u201cBut I was, after all that change, still only myself,\u201d he wrote.\n9. Farewell to the iPod.\nWhen Apple began marketing iPods in October 2001, ithoped to enhance Macintosh computer sales. The earliest devices were white, pocket-size rectangles, weighing 6.5 ounces and holding 1,000 songs.\nThey exploded in popularity in the years that followed, creating what became known as the iPod generation. Some 450 million iPods later, the device has upended how music is consumed, and set a blueprint for the company for decades, spawning iTunes, the iPhone and the App Store.\nBut only three million iPods were sold last year, andApple saidyesterday that it had discontinued the remaining iPod Touch line.\n10. And finally,\u201cThe Bachelor\u201d comes to Brooklyn.\nElan Ashendorf, 30, is gainfully employed. He likes bike rides, Lego bricks and Google sheets. But he has hadtrouble making the jumpfrom \u201csituationships\u201d to relationships. Enter a tight group of childhood friends to make it happen.\nTogether they conceived \u201cThe Bushwick Bachelor,\u201d a YouTube reality series modeled on the ABC franchise.

        "title": "Farewell to the iPod",
        "fulltext": "The iPod began with a modest goal: Let\u2019s create a music product that makes people want to buy more Macintosh computers. Within a few years, it would change consumer electronics and the music industry and lead to Apple becoming the most valuable company in the world.\nFirstarriving in October 2001, the pocket-size rectangle with a white face and polished steel frame weighed 6.5 ounces. It came packaged with white earbuds in a custom color, moon gray, and held 1,000 songs.\nIt exploded in popularity in the years that followed, creating what became known as the iPod generation. Throughout much of the 2000s, people wandered the world, headphones dangling from their ears. The iPod was ubiquitous.\nOn Tuesday, Apple officially said goodbye to all that. The company announced it had phased out production of itsiPod Touch, bringing an end to a two-decade run of a product line that inspired the creation of the iPhone and helped turn Silicon Valley into the epicenter of global capitalism.\nSince introducing the iPod in 2001, Apple has sold an estimated 450 million of them, according to Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm specializing in tech research. Last year it sold an estimated three million iPods, a fraction of the estimated 250 million iPhones it sold.\nApple assured customers that the music would live on, largely through the iPhone, which it introduced in 2007, andApple Music, a seven-year-old servicethat testifies to customers\u2019 modern preferences. The days of buying and owning 99-cent songs on an iPod largely gave way to monthly subscription offerings that provide access to broader catalogs of music.\nThe iPod provided a blueprint for Apple for decades by packaging unrivaled industrial design, hardware engineering, software development and services. It also demonstrated how the company was seldom first to market with a new product but often triumphed.\nIn the late 1990s, the first digital music players were beginning to appear. The earliest versions could hold a couple of dozen songs, allowing people who were in the early days of copying CDs onto their computers to transfer those songs into their pockets.\nSteve Jobs, who returned to Apple in 1997 after being pushed out more than a decade earlier, viewed the emerging category as an opportunity for giving Apple\u2019s legacy computer business modern appeal. A die-hard music fan, who ranked the Beatles and Bob Dylan among his favorite artists, Mr. Jobs thought tapping into people\u2019s love of music would help persuade them to switch to Macintoshes from Microsoft-powered personal computers, which had a more than 90 percent market share.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do any market research,\u201d said Jon Rubinstein, who led Apple\u2019s engineering at the time. \u201cEveryone loved music.\u201d\nMr. Rubinstein helped spark the product\u2019s development by discovering a new hard disk drive made by Toshiba during a trip to Japan. The 1.8-inch drive had the capacity to store 1,000 songs. In essence, it made possible a Sony Walkman-size digital player with a capacity multitudes greater than anything that existed in the market.\nThe iPod\u2019s development coincided with Apple\u2019s acquisition of a company with MP3 software that would become the basis for iTunes, a digital jukebox that organized people\u2019s music libraries so that they could quickly create playlists and transfer songs. It powered Mr. Jobs\u2019s vision for how people would purchase music in the digital age.\n\u201cWe think people want to buy their music on the internet by buying downloads, just like they bought LPs, just like they bought cassettes, just like they bought CDs,\u201d hesaid in a 2003 talk.\nAt the time, a service called Napster was tormenting the music industry, making it possible for people to share any song with anyone around the world for free. Mr. Jobs leaned into the music industry\u2019s woes by marketing the ability of new Macs to copy CDs with the commercial slogan: \u201cRip. Mix. Burn.\u201d The campaign put the music industry in Apple\u2019s corner, according to Albhy Galuten, an executive at Universal Music Group at the time.\nMr. Galuten said the labels eventually agreed to let Apple sell songs on iTunes for 99 cents. \u201cWe folded because we had no leverage,\u201d Mr. Galuten said. \u201cThe easiest way to fight piracy was with convenience.\u201d\nThe first-generation iPod\u2019s $399 price tag blunted demand, limiting the company to sales of fewer than 400,000 units in the first year. Three years later, Apple released the iPod Mini, a 3.6-ounce aluminum case that came in silver, gold, pink, blue and green. It cost $249 and carried 1,000 songs. Sales exploded. By the end of its fiscal year in September 2005, it had sold 22.5 million iPods.\nApple amplified the iPod Mini\u2019s power by making iTunes available for Windows computers, allowing Apple to introduce its brand to millions of new customers. Though the maneuver would later be heralded as a stroke of business brilliance, Mr. Jobs resisted it at the time, former executives said.\nSoon, iPods were everywhere. \u201cIt took off like a rocket,\u201d Mr. Rubinstein said.\nStill, Mr. Jobs pushed for Apple to make the iPod smaller and more powerful. Mr. Rubinstein said the company shut down production of its most popular product ever \u2014 the iPod Mini \u2014 in order to replace it with a slimmer version called the Nano that started at $200. The Nano helped the company nearly double its unit sales to 40 million over the next year.\nPerhaps the iPod\u2019s most important contribution was its role as a catalyst for the creation of the iPhone. As mobile phone makers began introducing devices that could play music, Apple executives worried about being leapfrogged by better technology. Mr. Jobs decided that if that were going to happen, then Apple should be the one to do it.\nThe iPhone continued to draw on the blend of software and services that made the iPod succeed. The success with iTunes, which allowed customers to back up their iPhone and put music on the device, was mirrored by the development of the App Store, which allowed people to download and pay for software and services.\nIn 2007, the company shed its longtime corporate moniker \u2014 Apple Computer Inc. \u2014 and became simply Apple, an electronics juggernaut six years in the making.\n\u201cThey showed the world they had an atomic bomb, and five years later they had a nuclear arsenal,\u201d said Talal Shamoon, the chief executive of Intertrust Technologies, a digital rights management company working with the music industry at the time. \u201cAfter that, there wasn\u2019t a shadow of doubt that Apple was going to own everybody.\u201d"

After the very good times in 2021, the reckoning for tech valuations, as well as start-up funding by venture capitalists and cryptocurrency, is officially here, with all plunging into the Mariana Trench of finance. The only question is whether it is 2001 (the Web 1.0 crash) or 2008 (the Web 2.0 crash) or some new web3 crash.\nThe canary in the coal mine is how those typically sunny venture capitalists\u2019 Twitter accounts have flipped to earnest talk of \u201cmarket corrections\u201d and \u201ccompany right-sizing.\u201d\nMost of the big company stocks have been in the tank, with even solid businesses suffering over the past month \u2014 Apple is down about 15 percent; Alphabet over 12 percent; Airbnb close to 28 percent. Weaker ones have seen a more precipitous decline; Netflix stock has lost half its value since mid-April.\nOddly, the one staying relatively stable now is Twitter, which spent years being lapped by other Silicon Valley firms. No doubt it\u2019s being propped up by the $44 billion takeover bid by Elon Musk \u2014 and yet even that acquisition is in now doubt since the collateral for the purchase rests with his fortune at Tesla. Like its peers, Tesla\u2019s bottoming out, its stock having dropped nearly 30 percent in the past month.\nThat might make the $1 billion walkaway fee much more attractive to Musk, who could come back when Twitter inevitably craters post-breakup. In the starkest of terms, he should not pay $54.20 a share for the troubled company (it was trading around $45 a share on Thursday), no matter how much he likes to troll.\nOh, but that is not all in the techopalypse.\nAs TheNew York Timesnoted: \u201cThe number of people and groups trying to unload their start-up shares doubled in the first three months of the year from late last year,\u201d citing Phil Haslett of EquityZen, which helps private companies and their employees sell their stock. Share prices of some unicorn start-ups have fallen as much as 44 percent in recent months, The Times wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s the first sustained pullback in the market that people have seen in legitimately 10 years,\u201d said Haslett.\nThat has also been accompanied by a significant drop in venture funding due to a fast fading I.P.O. market.\nAnd what about cryptocurrencies, which were booming after a slide last summer? Bitcoin, the most stable, rose to around $68,000 last November, but has fallen off a cliff to just above $28,600 today. The crypto trading platform Coinbase is another big loser, down over 60 percent in the past month. Meme stock catchphrase HODL (\u201chold on for dear life\u201d) might actually cost you your life, your financial one at least.\nAs tech\u2019s gloomiest venture capitalist, Bill Gurley, who is frequently right and never in doubt,wrote in April on Twitter: \u201cAn entire generation of entrepreneurs and tech investors built their entire perspectives on valuation during the second half of a 13-year amazing bull market run. The \u2018unlearning\u2019 process could be painful, surprising and unsettling to many. I anticipate denial.\u201d\nAnd he alsonoted: \u201cRevenue & earnings quality matter.\u201d\nHe\u2019s wrong on that last point \u2014 at this moment, nothing matters, so it might be a good idea to sit very quietly and think hard about the growth-at-any-cost mantra that has illuminated tech for the past 13 years. No less than the chief executive of the size-obsessed Uber, which Gurley financed, was out this weekpreaching restraint. \u201cWe have to make sure our unit economics work before we go big,\u201d said Dara Khosrowshahi in a note to his employees. \u201cWe will be even more hard-core about costs across the board.\u201d\nAs it turns out, there is always a cost.\nTripp Mickle recently joined The New York Times to cover Apple, after nearly eight years at The Wall Street Journal. He has a book out this month, \u201cAfter Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul.\u201d I\u2019ve edited his answers.\nWhen Steve Jobs died in the fall of 2011, many thought Apple wouldn\u2019t be able to thrive without him. Of course, the opposite has come true as Apple has become one of the most valuable companies on the planet. To what do you attribute that?\nTim Cook and the rest of the Apple leadership team deserve a great deal of credit for proving the skeptics wrong. Early on, Cook did an admirable job of keeping together the team Jobs assembled and encouraging it to find a new way of working. He empowered Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s design chief, to lead the development of the Apple Watch. The project gave birth to AirPods \u2014 and a nearly $40 billion annual business. It also alleviated, for a time, questions from customers and Wall Street about whether Apple could create another new product category.\nPerhaps more important, Cook increased Apple\u2019s financial discipline, controlled costs and found a way to squeeze more sales out of the iPhone through apps and subscription services. The profitability of that business increased Apple\u2019s value in the eyes of Wall Street. Essentially, Cook recognized that the iPhone had made Apple more powerful than any cable or wireless company in history because its signature product, as Oprah said, was in one billion pockets.\nApple has turned in consistently spectacular financial results. Who deserves the credit: Tim Cook or the iPhone itself?\nThe two are inseparable. When Tim Cook stepped in as chief executive in 2011, Apple was shipping 20 million iPhones a year. Today, it ships 200 million. It has done so without a major slip-up \u2014 and even benefited from a calamity at rival Samsung, which was challenging Apple until exploding Galaxy phones caused its business to founder.\nMeanwhile, it was Cook who laid the groundwork for the iPhones to take off. He negotiated the signature deal with China Mobile that made the iPhone available to a potential 700 million new customers in China. He later identified and leaned into the iPhone\u2019s power as a distribution system to sell more services.\nIn much the same way Jobs expertly marketed Apple devices to customers, Cook expertly promoted the potential of services to Wall Street, assuring investors in 2017 those sales would more than double in the coming years. In typical Cook fashion, he delivered on that promise ahead of schedule.\nApple seems to be firing on all cylinders now, so what are the biggest challenges it faces in the future, leaving out the stock market declines of late?\nChina. China. And China. In a world of rising geopolitical tensions and deepening awareness of the plight of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Apple is likely to face pressure from United States lawmakers, employees and customers to diversify its supply chain and begin manufacturing products at scale outside China. Doing so won\u2019t be easy. Apple has struggled with initial efforts to spin up product assembly in India, where poor workplace conditions at a Foxconn plant required an investigation.\nApple also faces trouble in the West. Regulators and lawmakers in the United States and Europe are both scrutinizing the 30 percent cut it takes of App Store sales. New rules or penalties could impair that all-important services business that Cook built.\nWhat are the sectors Apple needs to move into and what is the overall timeline for the next big thing for the company?\nThere\u2019s a principle that business leaders refer to called the law of large numbers. Essentially, once a business\u2019s sales swell, a company has to find an even bigger business to move into in order to deliver sufficient revenue growth. Many years ago, Apple recognized that it had saturated the consumer electronics industry and would have to jump into new and enormous sectors to find growth. It has looked at health care, transportation and energy. Its foray into health has delivered limited sales upside so far beyond the Apple Watch.\nThe most promising \u2014 and confounding \u2014 opportunity is probably in transportation. The company began working on a car in 2015 and wanted to release it in 2019. But it has been stymied by differing opinions internally about what it should be. Should it be an electric vehicle that competes with Tesla? Or a fully autonomous vehicle that leapfrogs others in the market? It is still sorting through those differences. The latest projections are that it would launch a car at the earliest in 2025.\nLina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission chief who\u2019s been under some pressure to get things moving there, finally got a turbocharge this week with the confirmation of Alvaro Bedoya, a lawyer and online-privacy expert, as the third Democrat on the commission\u2019s five-member governing board. It gives Khanthe majority she needsto push through a series of Big Tech actions she has talked about.\nTaking on technology firms\u2019 power was the hope behind her appointment by President Biden; the 33-year-old Khan created big waves because of her wunderkind legal reputation on antitrust \u2014 her student law review article taking on Amazon wasa sensationwhen it was published in 2017. Now Khan must deliver on that promise by finding ways that can pass legal muster to throttle down companies like Meta, Alphabet and Apple.\nShe could focus on a backward attempt to unwind Amazon\u2019s $8.5 billion acquisition of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio (tough) or Microsoft\u2019s pending nearly $70 billion purchase of the video game giant Activision Blizzard (tougher) and she also has her eye on a range of ways to control algorithms and protect consumers\u2019 privacy around data (not clear if this is even in within the F.T.C. purview).\nIn aJanuary \u201cSway\u201d interview, Khan said she had a \u201cfierce sense of urgency\u201d about her tenure and a desire to get going on enforcing antitrust. \u201cThe key task for antitrust enforcers is to ensure that we have a marketplace where firms can compete on the merits,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so really, the goal of the enforcers is to create a marketplace that\u2019s competitive, that\u2019s open, that\u2019s fair.\u201d\nNow that she\u2019s got her majority, the clock is ticking louder than ever for Khan.\nOne assumes in the end that despite his protestations otherwise, Donald Trump won\u2019t be able to resist trying to find a way back onto Twitter, per ElonMusk\u2019s invitationto him this week \u2014 exactly asI predicted. But Trump has a diminished social media reputation due to his, so far, limp postings on his own competing Truth Social service. And, sources tell me, he\u2019s up against legal and contractual problems if he tweets rather than \u201ctruths,\u201d the in-house word for posts on Trump\u2019s service (not a whiff of irony there).\nBut news of the possible lifting of Twitter\u2019s permanent Trump ban \u2014 a big if since Musk is not now andmay not everbe the owner of the service \u2014 gave Truth Social\u2019s chief executive, Devin Nunes, a chance to dunk on Musk, albeit politely.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very supportive of what Elon is saying,\u201d Nunes toldFox News. \u201cThe question is, will he actually be able to accomplish what he\u2019s saying, dealing with all the employees, dealing with all the algorithms? But the goal has been for us, for President Trump, to give the American people their voice back, and open the internet back up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to create.\n\u201cTruth Social is wide open right now in the Apple App Store, and you don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s opinion. There\u2019s no Big Tech tyrant that can cancel you, you don\u2019t have to go to a billionaire to ask permission. You\u2019re let on: Democrat, Republican, whoever you are. And we\u2019re not going to censor you for political speech, so we are accomplishing what the mission of our company is, which is to get this internet open back up.\u201d\nThis is where we are, folks: fighting over Trump\u2019s inane online utterances \u2014 which is just how he likes it."

        "title": "The Era of Borderless Data Is Ending",
        "fulltext": "Every time we send an email, tap an Instagram ad or swipe our credit cards, we create a piece of digital data.\nThe information pings around the world at the speed of a click, becoming a kind of borderless currency thatunderpins the digital economy. Largely unregulated, the flow of bits and bytes helped fuel the rise of transnational megacompanies like Google and Amazon and reshaped global communications, commerce, entertainment and media.\nNow the era of open borders for data is ending.\nFrance, Austria, South Africa and more than 50 other countries are accelerating efforts to control the digital information produced by their citizens, government agencies and corporations. Driven by security and privacy concerns, as well as economic interests and authoritarian and nationalistic urges, governments are increasingly setting rules and standards about how data can and cannot move around the globe. The goal is to gain \u201cdigital sovereignty.\u201d\nConsider that:\nIn Washington, the Biden administration is circulating an early draft of an executive order meant to stop rivals like China from gaining access to American data.\nIn the European Union, judges and policymakers are pushing efforts to guard information generated within the 27-nation bloc, including tougher online privacy requirements and rules for artificial intelligence.\nIn India, lawmakers are moving to pass a law that would limit what data could leave the nation of almost 1.4 billion people.\nThe number of laws, regulations and government policies that require digital information to be stored in a specific country more than doubled to 144 from 2017 to 2021,according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\nWhile countries like China have long cordoned off their digital ecosystems, the imposition of more national rules on information flows is a fundamental shift in the democratic world and alters how the internet has operated since it became widely commercialized in the 1990s.\nThe repercussions for business operations, privacy and how law enforcement and intelligence agencies investigate crimes and run surveillance programs are far-reaching.Microsoft, Amazon and Google are offering new services to let companies store records and information within a certain territory. And the movement of data has become part of geopolitical negotiations, including a new pact for sharing information across the Atlantic that was agreed to in principle in March.\n\u201cThe amount of data has become so big over the last decade that it has created pressure to bring it under sovereign control,\u201d said Federico Fabbrini, a professor of European law at Dublin City University who edited a book on the topic and argues that data is inherently harder to regulate than physical goods.\nFor most people, the new restrictions are unlikely to shut down popular websites. But users might lose access to some services or features depending on where they live. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, recently said it would temporarily stop offering augmented reality filters in Texas and Illinois to avoid being sued under laws governing the use of biometric data.\nThe debate over restricting data echoes broader fractures in the global economy. Countries are rethinking their reliance on foreign assembly lines after supply chains sputtered in the pandemic, delaying deliveries of everything from refrigerators to F-150s. Worried that Asian computer chip producers might be vulnerable to Beijing\u2019s influence, American and European lawmakers are pushing to build moredomestic factories for the semiconductorsthat power thousands of products.\nShifting attitudes toward digital information are \u201cconnected to a wider trend toward economic nationalism,\u201d said Eduardo Ustaran, a partner at Hogan Lovells, a law firm that helps companies comply with new data rules.\nThe core idea of \u201cdigital sovereignty\u201d is that the digital exhaust created by a person, business or government should be stored inside the country where it originated, or at least handled in accordance with privacy and other standards set by a government. In cases where information is more sensitive, some authorities want it to be controlled by a local company, too.\nThat\u2019s a shift from today. Most files were initially stored locally on personal computers and company mainframes. But as internet speeds increased and telecommunications infrastructure advanced over the past two decades, cloud computing services allowed someone in Germany to store photos on a Google server in California, or a business in Italy to run a website off Amazon Web Services operated from Seattle.\nA turning point came after the national security contractor Edward Snowdenleaked scores of documents in 2013that detailed widespread American surveillance of digital communications. In Europe, concerns grew that a reliance on American companies like Facebook left Europeans vulnerable to U.S. snooping. That led to protracted legal fights over online privacy and to trans-Atlantic negotiations to safeguard communications and other information transported to American firms.\nThe aftershocks are still being felt.\nWhile the United States supports a free, unregulated approach that lets data zip between democratic nations unhindered, China has been joined by Russia and others in walling off the internet and keeping data within reach to surveil citizens and suppress dissent. Europe, with heavily regulated markets and rules on data privacy, is forging another path.\nIn Kenya, draft rules require that information from payments systems and health services be primarily stored inside the country, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Kazakhstan has said personal data must be kept on a server within its borders.\nIn the European Union, the personal data of Europeans must meet the requirements of an online privacy law, theGeneral Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in 2018. Another draft law, the Data Act, would apply new limits on what corporate information could be made available to intelligence services and other authorities outside the bloc, even with a court order.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same sense of the sovereign state, that we can maintain knowledge about what we do in areas that are sensitive, and that is part of what defines us,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, thetop antitrust enforcerof the European Union, said in an interview.\nThe Biden administration recently drafted an executive order to give the government more power to block deals involving Americans\u2019 personal data that put national security at risk, two people familiar with the matter said. An administration official said the document, which Reutersearlier reported, was an initial draft sent to federal agencies for feedback.\nBut Washington has tried to keep data flowing between America and its allies. On a March trip to Brussels to coordinate a response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, President Biden announced anew agreementto allow data from the European Union to continue flowing to the United States.\nThe deal was needed after the top European courtstruck downa previous agreement in 2020 because it did not protect European citizens from spying by American law enforcement, imperiling the operations of thousands of companies that beam data across the Atlantic.\nIn a joint statementin December, Gina Raimondo, the U.S. secretary of commerce, and Nadine Dorries, Britain\u2019s top digital minister, said they hoped to counteract \u201cthe negative trends that risk closing off international data flows.\u201d The Commerce Departmentalso announcedlast month that it was joining with several Asian nations and Canada to keep digital information flowing between countries.\nAs new rules have been introduced, the tech industry has raised alarms. Groups representing Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta argued the online economy was fueled by the free flow of data. If tech companies were required to store it all locally, they could not offer the same products and services around the world, they said.\nBut countries nevertheless clamped down. In France and Austria, customers of Google\u2019s internet measurement software, Google Analytics, which many websites use to collect audience figures, were told this year not to use the program anymore because it could expose the personal data of Europeans to American spying.\nLast year, the French government scrapped a deal with Microsoft to handle health-related data after the authorities were criticized for awarding the contract to an American firm. Officialspledgedto work with local firms instead.\nCompanies have adjusted. Microsoft said it was taking steps so customers could more easily keep data within certain geographical areas. Amazon Web Services, the largest cloud computing service, said it let customers control where in Europe data was stored\nIn France, Spain and Germany, Google Cloud has signed deals in the last year with local tech and telecom providers so customers can guarantee that a local company oversees their data while they use Google\u2019s products.\n\u201cWe want to meet them where they are,\u201d said Ksenia Duxfield-Karyakina, who leads Google Cloud\u2019s public policy operations in Europe.\nLiam Maxwell, director of government transformation at Amazon Web Services, said in a statement that the company would adapt to European regulations but that customers should be able to buy cloud computing services based on their needs, \u201cnot limited by where the technology provider is headquartered.\u201d\nMax Schrems, an Austrian privacy activist who won lawsuits against Facebook over its data-sharing practices, said more disputes loom over digital information. He predicted the U.S.-E.U. data deal announced by Mr. Biden would be struck down again by the European Court of Justice because it still did not meet E.U. privacy standards.\n\u201cWe had a time where data was not regulated at all and people did whatever they wanted,\u201d Mr. Schrems said. \u201cNow gradually we see that everyone tries to regulate it but regulate it differently. That\u2019s a global issue.\u201d\nAna Swansoncontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple Inc., \u2018After Steve\u2019",
        "fulltext": "AFTER STEVE: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul,by Tripp Mickle\nBetween 2001 and 2010, Apple launched the iPod, the iPhone, the MacBook Air and the iPad; each redefined its product category. Of these, the iPhone was the most important. Its obvious superiority forced every other company selling expensive phones to copy Apple\u2019s design or collapse. (Nokia, BlackBerry and Palm were gutted within years.) The Apple of 2010, at the end of itsdecennium mirabilis, had a record of hardware innovation no other electronics firm could match. Including the Apple of 2020.\nSteve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder and animating spirit, died in 2011, leaving the firm in the hands of Jony Ive, the British-born designer-savant, and Tim Cook, a child of Alabama who\u2019d become a master of supply chains and production costs. \u201cAfter Steve,\u201d by the New York Times reporter Tripp Mickle, covers Ive\u2019s and Cook\u2019s careers, and how they and the company changed after they took over.\nThe book traces the evolution and end of Ive and Cook\u2019s partnership, involving compendious review of public sources and over 200 interviews with current and former Apple employees and advisers; the cast of characters itself runs to four pages. Some of this technique is in response to Apple\u2019s \u201cculture of omert\u00e0\u201d \u2014 apparently, neither Ive nor Cook agreed to speak to the author for attribution \u2014 but Mickle uses comparative descriptions to sketch out their differences, like how Ive drives to work in a bright yellow Saab, Cook in a drab Honda Accord.\nBoth men helped save a sinking Apple in the 1990s \u2014 Ive first, overseeing the design of a new line of computers with candy-colored transparent cases. When the iMac launched in 1998, Jobs unveiled Ive\u2019s creation by pulling a sheet off it, as if it were a sculpture, saying, \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s from another planet, a good planet with better designers.\u201d Those eye-catching iMacs improved the company\u2019s public perception, staff morale and bottom line all at once. Apple was saved. Now it just had to grow.\nThat same year, Jobs tapped Cook to rework Apple\u2019s inefficient production line. Cook, who\u2019d previously run the supply chain for Compaq, was famously demanding and detail-oriented. When his staff presented a plan to increase inventory turnover from 25 times a year to 100 to save money on \u201cspoiling parts,\u201d Cook calmly asked, \u201cHow would you get to a thousand?\u201d Joe O\u2019Sullivan, who was running operations when Cook arrived, said, \u201cI saw grown men cry. \u2026 He went into a level of detail that was phenomenal.\u201d\nIve was also demanding, of both his colleagues and external suppliers. In one meeting, shown a piece of polished aluminum for a laptop case, Ive became visibly upset at imperfections barely visible to the others. Seeking to calm him, one of his colleagues handed him a red Sharpie, telling Ive to circle what was wrong. \u201cI\u2019ve got a different idea,\u201d came Ive\u2019s reply. \u201cGet me a bucket of red paint. I\u2019ll dip this in it and wipe off the things that are right.\u201d Ive was not just a perfectionist but a corporate infighter as well. He revoked engineers\u2019 access to the design wing if they talked too loudly or mentioned costs. This sort of behavior was so widely known, a source in H.R. told Mickle they\u2019d sometimes physically hidden staff from Ive to keep them from getting fired.\nPerfectionism isn\u2019t enough to create a great product, however. After Jobs\u2019s death, there was uncertainty about what the Next Big Thing might be. Home automation, health care devices, self-driving cars, televisions and various headphones were all explored, and some launched. But for most of Ive\u2019s remaining tenure, the centerpiece of Apple\u2019s device work \u2014 and therefore of Mickle\u2019s book \u2014 would be the Apple Watch.\nIve had been the key figure in product design for years, but in his elevated role, Mickle writes, \u201cdesigners defined how a product would look and had an outsize voice in its functions. Staff began summarizing their power in a single phrase: \u2018Don\u2019t disappoint the gods.\u2019\u201d Apple\u2019s wealth underwrote Ive\u2019s perfectionism. Leather for the wristband was sourced from tanneries across Europe; countless hours were poured into the design and manufacture of the customized winding crown. Determined from the beginning to make ultraexpensive versions, Ive requested \u2014 and got \u2014 a new 18-karat alloy that was twice as durable as ordinary gold.\nYet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear the watch will not be the Next Big Thing. As Ive acquires more control than he had over the iPhone, the watch shifts from a useful screen on your wrist into a fashion object. Meetings with the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, a product event in Paris and the creation of a $17,000 model run alongside gradually reduced expectations for its health tracking and battery life. By the time it finally launches and sales fall short of projections, the reader has seen it coming, one decision at a time.\nIn contrast to Ive\u2019s big project, Cook faced a welter of events. He was called before Congress over taxes. He had to apologize for poor performance in the earliest iteration of Apple Maps. The Samsung Galaxy, an iPhone competitor, regularly burst into flames.China\u2019s largest telecom, China Mobile, signaled interest in selling iPhones. In 2014, Cook made history inBloomberg Businessweek, writing, \u201cWhile I have never denied my sexuality, I haven\u2019t publicly acknowledged it either, until now. So let me be clear: I\u2019m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.\u201d He was the first C.E.O. of a Fortune 500 company to come out. And of course, in 2018, he became the first leader of a public company worth a trillion dollars. Then two trillion. Then three.\nMickle builds a dense, granular mosaic of the firm\u2019s trials and triumphs, showing us how Apple, built on Ive\u2019s successes in the 2000s, became Cook\u2019s company in the 2010s. Ive, long since knighted, becomes increasingly captivated by opportunities outside Apple \u2014 a museum exhibition, a charity auction, an immersive Christmas tree installation \u2014 and goes part time in 2015. Realizing this is worse than having Ive either fully present or absent, Cook persuades him to come back, but his heart clearly isn\u2019t in it. Finally, in 2019, Iveleaves for good.\nIn the epilogue, Mickle drops his reporter\u2019s detachment to apportion responsibility for the firm\u2019s failure to launch another transformative product. Cook is blamed for being aloof and unknowable, a bad partner for Ive, \u201can artist who wanted to bring empathy to every product.\u201d Ive is also dinged for taking on \u201cresponsibility for software design and the management burdens that he soon came to disdain.\u201d By the end, the sense that the two missed a chance to create a worthy successor to the iPhone is palpable.\nIt\u2019s also hooey, and the best evidence for that is the previous 400 pages. It\u2019s true that after Jobs died, Apple didn\u2019t produce another device as important as the iPhone, but Apple didn\u2019t produce another device that importantbeforehe died either. It\u2019s also true that Cook did not play the role of C.E.O. as Jobs had, but no one ever thought he could, including Jobs, who on his deathbed advised Cook never to ask what Steve would do: \u201cJust do what\u2019s right.\u201d\nIve and Cook wanted another iPhone, but, as Mickle\u2019s exhaustive reporting makes clear, there was not another such device to be made. Self-driving cars were too hard, health devices too regulated, television protected in ways music had not been, and even the earbuds and watch, devices they actually shipped, were peripheral, technically and conceptually, to Apple\u2019s greatest product.\nEpilogue aside, the book is an amazingly detailed portrait of the permanent tension between strategy and luck: Companies make their own history, but they do not make it as they please. What happened after Steve was that Cook\u2019s greatest opportunities were in Apple\u2019s future, Ive\u2019s in its past. When the Next Big Thing turned out to be services \u2014 iCloud, Apple Music, the App Store \u2014 built on top of the Last Big Thing, Cook adapted brilliantly. He took Jobs\u2019s advice and did what was right, but in ways that put less of a premium on the kind of work Ive was best at. The moral of that story is there is no moral. Even one of the richest, most beloved firms in the world could not make its most talented employees successful at the same time.\nClay Shirky is a professor at N.Y.U. and the author, most recently, of \u201cLittle Rice: Smartphones, Xiaomi, and the Chinese Dream.\u201d\nAFTER STEVEHow Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its SoulBy Tripp Mickle495 pp. William Morrow. $29.99."

        "fulltext": "European Union regulators said on Monday that Apple had broken antitrust laws by unfairly undercutting companies whose payment services competed with Apple Pay, in the latest crackdown by European authorities on the world\u2019s largest tech companies.\nApple has abused its dominance in consumer electronics by not giving PayPal and others access technology in the iPhone and Apple Watch that lets people make a purchase with a quick tap, according to a preliminary judgment announced by the European Commission, the European Union\u2019s executive body.\nThe commission argues that Apple blocks rival services from gaining access to the hardware and software on its devices that enable the interaction with payment terminals in stores, known as near-field communication technology, or NFC.\nThe case illustrates Europe\u2019s strategy of using several kinds of action to regulate the digital economy. In addition to antitrust cases, the European Union has agreed to two new laws since March intended to address what policymakers see asanticompetitive business practicesand weak policies byinternet and social media firmsto remove illicit content from their websites and services.\nThe charges against Apple, after an investigation that began in 2020, were announced in Brussels on Monday by Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of antitrust enforcement. Apple will have a chance to respond before a final judgment is announced. The company could be fined up to 10 percent of its global revenue. It could also reach a settlement with regulators.\nRegulators said Apple had used its control of the iPhone and other products to become the dominant service in the fast-growing area of mobile payments.\n\u201cMobile payments play a rapidly growing role in our digital economy,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in a statement. \u201cWe have indications that Apple restricted third-party access to key technology necessary to develop rival mobile wallet solutions on Apple\u2019s devices.\u201d\nOn Monday, Apple said that it provided an \u201ceasy and secure\u201d way to make payments, and that its policies did not restrict competition.\n\u201cApple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security,\u201d the statement said.\n\u201cWe will continue to engage with the commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment,\u201d Apple said.\nEuropean regulators have been trying to address what they see as abusive business practices by big tech companies that use their dominance in one area to take control of adjacent markets. Last year, Ms. Vestager brought antitrust charges against Apple in response to complaints by Spotify and others about the 30 percent commission the company levies on purchases made inside apps, a case that is still under review.\nGoogle has been fined billions of euros for using the dominance of its search engine, its Android mobile operating system and its advertising services to box out rivals. Amazon is under investigation over claims that it abuses the dominance of its shopping service to harm merchants who rely on its website to reach customers. Facebook, too, is being investigated, accused of anticompetitive practices related to its control of the market for social networking.\nEurope\u2019s tough approach to technology regulation long found little echo in the United States, but American authorities have begun to use antitrust enforcement to crimp the power of Big Tech. The Justice Department has brought antitrust charges against Google, and the Federal Trade Commission is going after Facebook."

        "title": "How Technocrats Triumphed at Apple",
        "fulltext": "After two years of development, thousands of engineering hours and countless days agonizing over the suppleness of leather and strength of gold for Apple\u2019s bold new product, the company\u2019s design chief, Jony Ive, was thrust into a high-stakes debate over the most primitive concern: a tent.\nIt was 2014, and Apple\u2019s future, more than ever, seemed to hinge on Mr. Ive. His love of pure, simple lines had already redrawn the world through such popular products as the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Now, he was seated at a conference table with Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, the two men embodying nearly 40 years of collaboration, with one designing and the other assembling the devices that turned a failing business into the world\u2019s largest company. They both wanted another hit, but Mr. Ive was pushing for a product reveal more audacious than any in the theatrical company\u2019s history.\nThe Apple Watch was slated to be introduced at a local community college auditorium near the company\u2019s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters. To bring cosmopolitan gloss to a suburban landscape of strip malls, Mr. Ive recommended removing two dozen trees and erecting a lavish white tent.\nHis extravagant vision wasn\u2019t going over well.\n\u201cThey want $25 million,\u201d a colleague said of the event\u2019s price tag.\nApple marketers at the table were aghast. Few could comprehend the logistics of moving trees, much less the staggering cost.\nIt was a microcosm of the challenges beginning to haunt Apple\u2019s top designer. He believed the watch\u2019s success hinged on persuading the world that it was a fashionable accessory. He regarded a rave from Vogue as more important than any tech reviewer\u2019s opinion. The tent was critical to making the event as glamorous as a high-end fashion show.\nBut under Mr. Cook\u2019s leadership, Apple was increasing its scrutiny of every dollar it spent and debating many ideas Mr. Ive proposed. The marketers not only questioned the expense; they also favored a more traditional product introduction, focused less on how the watch looked and more on what it could do, like tracking a workout or tapping a wrist with a text message.\nMr. Cook rocked in his chair as the group discussed Mr. Ive\u2019s idea. It had been nearly three years since Steve Jobs died at the age of 56, and as C.E.O., Mr. Cook had looked to Mr. Ive \u2014 the man Mr. Jobs called his \u201cspiritual partner\u201d \u2014 to lead product development. The designer\u2019s value to the company was so great that Mr. Cook feared that investors would sell shares if Mr. Ive left. Former company executives estimated that an Ive departure would erase more than $50 billion from Apple\u2019s market value, or as much as 10 percent. Mr. Cook stopped rocking. \u201cWe should just do it,\u201d he said.\nTo many present, Mr. Cook\u2019s approval seemed like a win for Mr. Ive. But the designer would later recast it as a Pyrrhic victory. He would tell colleagues that the debate over the event and the larger struggle over the watch\u2019s marketing were among the first moments that he felt unsupported at Apple.\nWith time, his grievances would grow. In the wake of Mr. Jobs\u2019s death, colleagues said, Mr. Ive fumed about corporate bloat, chafed at Mr. Cook\u2019s egalitarian structure, lamented the rise of operational leaders and struggled with a shift in the company\u2019s focus from making devices to developing services.\nDisillusioned with Mr. Cook\u2019s Apple, Mr. Ive would depart five years later, in 2019. His exit would change forever the balance of power at the top of a company long defined by its product ingenuity, leaving it without one of its most creative thinkers and the driving force behind its last new device category.\nToday, Apple boasts a market value of $2.57 trillion and a lineup of legacy products that have helped it preserve its perch as America\u2019s largest public company. In Mr. Ive\u2019s absence, Mr. Cook has accelerated a shift in strategy that has made the company better known for offering TV shows and a credit card than introducing the kind of revolutionary new devices that once defined it.\nThis account of Mr. Ive\u2019s resignation is adapted from a new book, \u201cAfter Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul,\u201d that I wrote. The book is based on interviews with more than 200 people, including former and current employees at Apple, as well as with friends and former colleagues of Mr. Ive. Representatives from Apple and LoveFrom, Mr. Ive\u2019s design firm, declined to comment for this article.\nIn July 2019, shortly after Mr. Ive left, Mr. Cook called news coverage on Mr. Ive\u2019s frustrations at Apple \u201cabsurd\u201d and said it \u201cdistorts relationships, decisions and events to the point that we just don\u2019t recognize the company it describes.\u201d Mr. Cook added that the projects the design team is working on \u201cwill blow you away.\u201d\nAt the time, Mr. Ive, who continues to this day to work with Apple as a consultant, said that the design team was \u201cstronger, more vibrant and more talented than at any point in Apple\u2019s history.\u201d\nEmployees were on edge as they entered Apple\u2019s on-campus lecture room in the summer of 1997 to hear Mr. Jobs assess their shortcomings. Since being ousted a decade earlier, Mr. Jobs had watched from outside as sales flagged at the company he co-founded. It was flirting with bankruptcy when the board turned to him for a rescue. He stepped before a despondent room and delivered a sharp rebuke.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this place?\u201d he asked, according to his biographer Walter Isaacson. \u201cThe products suck! There\u2019s no sex in them anymore!\u201d\nSeated near the back of the room, Mr. Ive found the criticism refreshing. The 30-year-old Briton, who had joined Apple five years earlier, hadn\u2019t yet realized that Mr. Jobs thought the design team was part of the company\u2019s problem.\nIn the wake of the meeting, Mr. Jobs sought to replace Mr. Ive as the leader of the design team and install a world-class talent from outside. He approached an Italian car designer and another computer designer, but his former partner on the original Macintosh, Hartmut Esslinger of Frog Design, urged him to keep the existing team.\n\u201cYou just need one hit,\u201d Mr. Esslinger said.\nMr. Jobs asked Mr. Ive to design what Mr. Jobs believed could be that hit: a \u201cnetwork computer\u201d focused on connecting to the internet. Mr. Ive pulled together the entire design team to work on the project and prodded the group to fulfill Mr. Jobs\u2019s request to make a computer that was joyful. They coalesced around the idea that it needed to be like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d TV cartoon: futuristic but familiar.\nThe resulting iMac featured a handle that Mr. Ive thought would make it more approachable. It came in a brilliant blue-green shade inspired by the waters of Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, where one of the designers surfed. Its translucent shell cost three times as much as a standard case, but Mr. Jobs supported the expense because it was essential to the design, and he planned to sell customers on how revolutionary it looked.\nAs Apple prepared to unveil the iMac in early May 1998, Mr. Jobs found what he considered a fatal flaw in its components. He expected the computer to feature a slot for a CD and instead found it featured a tray. He was irate and threatened to cancel its introduction, according to employees present. After Mr. Jobs finished cursing out his staff, Mr. Ive found his boss backstage. The designer sought to calm him down.\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of the next iMac,\u201d Mr. Ive said.\nMr. Jobs took a breath. The anger began to leave his face. \u201cI got it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got it.\u201d\nThe two men walked away together with the C.E.O.\u2019s arm draped over his designer\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFrom then on, when Jony was in the room, it was a relief for Steve,\u201d said Wayne Goodrich, Mr. Jobs\u2019s longtime executive producer.\nDemand for the iMac exploded. Apple sold one of the computers every 15 seconds around the world, making it, at the time, the fastest selling computer in history.\nThe iMac\u2019s success cemented Mr. Ive\u2019s relationship with Mr. Jobs. They discovered overlapping design sensibilities, with each favoring a minimalist philosophy: Keep it simple. They also balanced each other\u2019s personalities. Whereas Mr. Jobs was voluble, direct and insistent, Mr. Ive was quiet, steady and patient. They ate lunch together regularly, and Mr. Jobs visited the design studio almost daily.\nTheir fast friendship and collaboration contrasted with the evolution of Mr. Jobs\u2019s relationship with Mr. Cook. It took a push from colleagues who feared Hewlett-Packard might poach Mr. Cook for Mr. Jobs to promote to him to chief operations officer in 2005, according to people familiar with the promotion. Mr. Jobs\u2019s decision to later tap Mr. Cook as his successor was motivated in part by the recognition that half of the company\u2019s value came from Mr. Cook\u2019s ability to manufacture and deliver its devices on time. Those skills would be critical to taking the iPhone from sales of 10 million units a year to 200 million.\nEven so, Mr. Jobs considered Mr. Ive the company\u2019s second-most powerful executive. He thrust the design team to the forefront of Apple\u2019s product development process, ensuring it played a central role in the iPod, iPhone and iPad. Employees summarized the group\u2019s clout with a single phrase: \u201cDon\u2019t disappoint the gods.\u201d\nOn Oct. 5, 2011, a symphony of notification dings rang across Apple\u2019s campus. An alert on employees\u2019 iPhones delivered the news: \u201cSteven P. Jobs, Apple co-founder, dead at 56.\u201d\nLess than 15 miles away,Mr. Ive sat in the gardenoutside Mr. Jobs\u2019s home. The October sky was hazy that day and his shoes were too tight. He felt numb as he recalled the last words his boss and friend told him: I will miss our talks together.\nIn the months that followed, Mr. Ive seemed to the other designers to be lost in a wilderness of grief. He spent his days speaking quietly with a colleague in what others described as endless therapy sessions. The idea to make a smartwatch snapped him out of his melancholy.\nAt the time, both Wall Street and customers were questioning whether Apple could deliver a new product without Mr. Jobs. Mr. Ive rallied the company to silence skeptics with the watch. Because it was the first Apple product that people would wear, he wanted customers to feel that they could personalize it. He championed an array of leather and silicone watchbands. He also brought on staff with fashion expertise.\nMr. Cook seldom visited the studio during the process. On one of the few occasions he did, it was to see a Leica camera Mr. Ive had helped design for a charity auction. Mr. Ive glowed as he detailed the designers\u2019 work on the camera for Mr. Cook, who nodded expressionlessly. People watching across the studio would later joke that they caught Mr. Cook\u2019s eyes straying from the charity camera to the nearby design tables topped with iPhones, iPads and Macs that the company sold for tremendous profit. He stayed only a few minutes.\nWhen Apple unveiled its watch at a community college theater in the fall of 2014, Apple employees gave Mr. Ive a standing ovation. He later traveled to Paris for fashion week where he was celebrated by fashion luminaries like Azzedine Ala\u00efa. He seemed to have reached a new pinnacle in his career.\nInstead of being energized, however, Mr. Ive seemed weary. When he assembled his team at the end of the year, designers and engineers said he complimented them for exceeding everyone\u2019s expectations. Then he paused and exhaled.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been at Apple for 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been one of the most challenging years I\u2019ve had.\u201d\nPraise for Apple\u2019s new device was short-lived. The Apple Watch struggled to match Wall Street\u2019s lofty sales expectations. Analysts expected the company to sell 40 million in the first year; it sold less than half that as early buyers complained about its limited battery and functions. After curtailing initial distribution in hopes of spurring demand, Mr. Cook expanded sales into major retailers. He later shifted the marketing focus from fashion to fitness.\nIn the midst of those changes, Mr. Ive approached Mr. Cook and told him that he was tired and wanted to step back from the business. Without Mr. Jobs, he had assumed much of the responsibility for the product\u2019s design and its marketing. People close to Mr. Ive said he had found it draining to fight with his colleagues over promotion and had become overwhelmed by managing a staff that stretched into the hundreds, multiples of the 20-person design team he ran for years.\nMr. Cook feared that Mr. Ive\u2019s departure would lead investors to sell shares. To avoid that, he and Mr. Ive reached an agreement for the designer to relinquish daily management responsibilities and work primarily on new products. He would work part time. The company gave him the title of chief design officer and promoted two of his lieutenants. Only a few people inside Apple knew the truth: Mr. Ive was frustrated and burned out.\nThe new arrangement freed Mr. Ive from regular commutes to the company\u2019s offices in Cupertino. He shifted from near daily product reviews to an irregular schedule when weeks would pass without weighing in. Sometimes word would spread through the studio that he was unexpectedly coming to the office. Employees compared the moments that followed with old footage of the 1920s stock market crash with papers being tossed into the air and people scurrying around in a furious rush to prepare for his arrival.\nWith anticipation mounting on Wall Street for a 10th-anniversary iPhone in early 2017, Mr. Ive summoned the company\u2019s top software designers to San Francisco for a product review. A team of about 20 arrived at the city\u2019s exclusive social club, The Battery, and began spreading out 11-by-17-inch printouts of design ideas in the club\u2019s penthouse. They needed Mr. Ive\u2019s approval for several features on the first iPhone with a full-screen display.\nThey waited that day for nearly three hours for Mr. Ive. When he finally arrived, he didn\u2019t apologize. He reviewed their printouts and offered feedback. He then left without making final decisions.As their work stalled, many wondered, How did it come to this?\nIn Mr. Ive\u2019s absence, Mr. Cook began reshaping the company in his image. He replaced the outgoing company director Mickey Drexler, the gifted marketer who built Gap and J. Crew, with James Bell, the former finance chief at Boeing. Mr. Ive was irate that a left-brained executive had supplanted one of the board\u2019s few right-brained leaders. \u201cHe\u2019s another one of those accountants,\u201d he complained to a colleague.\nMr. Cook also emboldened the company\u2019s finance department, which began auditing outside contractors. At one point, the department rejected a legitimate billing submitted by Foster + Partners, the architecture firm working closely with Mr. Ive to complete the company\u2019s new $5 billion campus, Apple Park.\nAmid those struggles, Mr. Cook began to broaden Apple\u2019s strategy into selling more services. During a corporate retreat in 2017, Mr. Ive stepped outside to get fresh air when a newcomer to Apple named Peter Stern stepped before the company\u2019s top leaders. Mr. Stern clicked to a slide of an X-shaped chart that showed Apple\u2019s profit margins from sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs declining while profit margins rose from sales of software and services like its iCloud storage.\nThe presentation alarmed some people in the audience. It depicted a future in which Mr. Ive \u2014 and the company\u2019s business as a product maker \u2014 would matter less and Mr. Cook\u2019s increasing emphasis on services, like Apple Music and iCloud, would matter more.\nOn a Tuesday evening in late June 2019, Mr. Ive convened his design teams in a San Francisco theater for a private screening of the movie \u201cYesterday.\u201d\nThe film imagined a world in which a singer-songwriter awakens from an accident and discovers that he\u2019s the only person in the world who remembers the Beatles, setting up a two-hour exploration of the eternal conflict between art and commerce.\nWhen the movie ended, Mr. Ive stepped in front of the group to speak. He was clearly inspired by the film.\n\u201cArt needs the proper space and support to grow,\u201d he said, according to those present that evening. \u201cWhen you\u2019re really big, that\u2019s especially important.\u201d\nA day later, June 27, the designers got a note asking them to clear their calendars for a meeting with Mr. Ive. He watched as the group assembled before him on the fourth floor of the company\u2019s new headquarters, which Mr. Cook had officially opened a month earlier. He told them that he had completed his most important project, the new building, and that his time leading them was finished.\nThe faces before him turned ashen. People stared at him blankly. Others said they suppressed a chorus of internal alarm: Oh my god! This is happening!\nFew knew the full extent of Mr. Ive\u2019s battles. Few were aware of his clash with Apple\u2019s finance team. Few understood how draining he found it to fight over marketing the watch, a product that had increased sales over time and become core to the company\u2019s $38 billion wearables business. Yet many could recognize the tediousness of annually updating the company\u2019s iPhones, iPads and Macs.\nMr. Ive praised the team and implored them to keep Apple true to its identity. He told them that he would continue to work with them as a contracted consultant through an independent design firm he was starting called LoveFrom. He didn\u2019t disclose that Apple had agreed to what amounted to a more than $100 million exit package, a payout on par with the golden parachutes other corporations had offered departing chief executives.\nAt the most recent product event, Mr. Cook started with less tangible Apple productions \u2014 an update on the company\u2019s broadcasting deal with Major League Baseball, and a celebration of accolades for the Apple TV+ movie \u201cCODA.\u201d The company also promoted a new desktop computer, trumpeting the power of the custom chip inside the machine ahead of its slim, aluminum design.\nIn Mr. Ive\u2019s absence, the designers say that they collaborate more with colleagues in engineering and operations and face more cost pressures than they did previously. Meanwhile, the products remain largely as they were when Mr. Ive left. The gods have become mortals."

        "title": "Big Tech Is Getting Clobbered on Wall Street. It\u2019s a Good Time for Them.",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and the parent companies of Facebook and Google have lost $2.7 trillion in value so far this year, about the annual gross domestic product of Britain.\nSo what have the companies done about this thrashing on Wall Street? Microsoft has doubled its employees\u2019 bonus pool, Google has committed to hiring more engineers, and Apple has showered its top hardware talent with $200,000 bonuses.\nThe dissonance between the stock market\u2019s relative panic and the business-as-usual calm among tech giants foreshadows a period when analysts, investors and economists predict that the world\u2019s largest companies will widen their lead in their respective markets.\nThe bullishness about their prospects reflects an understanding that the companies have tight control of some of the world\u2019s most lucrative businesses: social media, premium smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing and search. Their dominance in those arenas and toeholds in other businesses should blunt the pains of inflation, even as those challengeshammer big companies such as Walmart and Targetand the stock market nears bear market territory.\nThe S&P 500 spent much of Friday below the threshold for what is considered a bear market \u2014 commonly defined as 20 percent below its last peak \u2014 before rallying late in the afternoon. The index ended the week with a loss of 3 percent, its seventh straight weekly decline. That\u2019s its longest stretch of losses since 2001.\nIn the months ahead, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon are expected to boost hiring, buy more businesses and emerge on the other side of a bearish economy stronger and more powerful \u2014 even if they shed some of their total valuation and their relentless growth of the last few years.\n\u201cBig tech can say, \u2018Forget the economy,\u2019\u201d said Richard Kramer, founder of the London-based advisory firm Arete Research. Flush with cash, he said, \u201cthey can invest through the cycle.\u201d\nThe large companies\u2019 plans contrast sharply with a wave of spending cuts crashing through the rest of the tech sector. Steep declines in share prices at unprofitable companies such as Uber, down 45 percent, and Peloton, down 58 percent, have led their chief executives to cut jobs or consider layoffs. Start-ups are pruning their workforces as venture capital funding slows.\nThose companies\u2019 plummeting values will create buying opportunities, said Toni Sacconaghi, a tech analyst at Bernstein, a research firm. Large deals may be difficult because the Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing takeover moves by Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, he said, but smaller deals for emerging technology or engineers could be rampant.\nDuring the Great Recession, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft acquired more than 100 companies from 2008 to 2010, according to Refinitiv, a financial data company. Some of those deals have become fundamental to their businesses today, including Apple\u2019s acquisition of the chip company P.A. Semi, which contributed to the company\u2019s development of its new laptop processors, and Google\u2019s acquisition of AdMob, which helped create a mobile advertising business.\n\u201cThe big will get bigger and the poor will get poorer,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, deputy dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cThat\u2019s the way network effects work.\u201d\nThere are caveats to this sense of invulnerability. The big companies\u2019 plans could always change if the economy continues to deteriorate and consumers pull back even further on their spending. And some of the big companies are more vulnerable than others.\nMeta Platforms, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has fared worse than its peers becauseits business is facing long-term challenges. It has posted falling profits as its user growth slows amid rising competition from TikTok, and changes in Apple\u2019s privacy policy stymie its ability to personalize ads.\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, has responded by instituting a temporary hiring freeze for some roles. During a recent all-hands meeting with staff, employees asked if layoffs would follow. Mr. Zuckerberg said that job cuts weren\u2019t in the company\u2019s current plans and were unlikely in the future, according to a spokesman. Instead, he said the company was focused on slowing spending and limiting its growth.\nAmazon sent a similar signal to its employees last month after it posted disappointing results. In a call with analysts, Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief, said Amazon would look to corral costs after itdoubled spending on warehouses and staffto keep pace with pandemic orders. As people return to work and travel, they are making fewer Amazon purchases, leaving the company with more space and staff than it needs.\nBut Amazon\u2019s lucrative cloud business, Amazon Web Services, or A.W.S. for short, continues to gush profits. The company plans to lean into its success in the months ahead by increasing its spending on data centers. It also has committed to raising the cap on base compensation of its corporate staff to $350,000, from $160,000. And it is investing in a plan to build a network of satellites to deliver high-speed internet by launching 38 rockets into space.\nBetween them, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Amazon had nearly $300 billion in cash, excluding debt, at the end of March, according to Loup Ventures, an investment firm specializing in tech research.\nThe cash reserves could fund accelerated stock buybacks as share prices fall, analysts say. Doing so would increase the companies\u2019 earnings per share, deliver more value to investors and signal to the market that their firms are more valuable than Wall Street is willing to acknowledge.\nThe companiesroared ahead during the pandemic as people sequestered at home immersed themselves in a digital world. Customer orders soared on Amazon, for everything from hand sanitizer to Instant Pots. Shuttered stores shifted sales online and ramped up Google and Facebook advertising. Remote students and employees splurged on new iPhones, iPads and Macs.\nThe last tech giant to cull its ranks during a major downturn, Microsoft, is doing the opposite during this turbulent period. Emboldened by abusiness that has proved more durablethan its peers, Microsoft is sweetening salaries, boosting its investments in cloud computing and standing by a $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard that it expects to unlock more sales for its gaming empire.\nSimilar resilience has been on display at Google and Apple. Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet, recently overhauled its performance review process and told staff that they would likely get pay increases, according toCNBC.It also plans to increase its spending on data centers to support its growing cloud business.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has a longstanding philosophy that Apple should continue to invest for the future amid a downturn. It more than doubled its staff during the Great Recession and nearly tripled its sales. Lately, it has increased bonuses to some hardware engineers by as much as $200,000, according toBloomberg.\nJohn Chambers, who steered Cisco Systems through multiple downturns as its former chief executive, said the companies\u2019 strong businesses and deep pockets could afford them the chance to take risks that would be impractical for smaller competitors. During the 2008 downturn, he said Cisco allowed distressed automakers to pay for technology services with credit at a time when competitors demanded cash. The company risked having to write down $1 billion in inventory, but emerged from the recession as the dominant provider to a healthy auto industry, he said.\n\u201cCompanies break away during downturns,\u201d Mr. Chambers said.\nExcelling will require disregarding the broader market\u2019s gloom, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. He said previous downturns had shown that even the strongest businesses were susceptible to profit pressures and prone to pulling back. \u201cFirms get pessimistic like everyone else,\u201d he said.\nThe first test for the biggest companies in tech will be contagion from their peers. Amazon\u2019s shares in the electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive have plunged more than 65 percent, a $7.6 billion paper loss. Apple\u2019s services sales are likely to be crimped by a slowdown in advertising by app developers, which rely on venture-capital funding to finance their marketing, analysts say. And start-ups are scrutinizing their spending on cloud services, which will likely slow growth for Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, analysts and cloud executives said.\n\u201cPeople are trying to figure out how to spend smartly,\u201d said Sam Ramji, the chief strategy officer at DataStax, a data management company.\nRegulatory challenges on the horizon could darken the big tech companies\u2019 prospects, as well. Europe\u2019s Digital Markets Act, which is expected to become law soon,is designed to increase the openness of tech platforms. Among other things, it could scuttle the estimated $19 billion that Apple collects from Alphabet to make Google the default search engine on iPhones, a change that Bernstein estimates could erase as much as 3 percent of Apple\u2019s pretax profit.\nBut the companies are expected to challenge the law in court, potentially tying up the legislation for years.
