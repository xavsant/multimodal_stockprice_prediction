        "title": "New iPad Pro Inches Toward Replacing PC, but Falls Short",
        "fulltext": "When Steve Jobsintroducedthe first iPad in 2010, he described the tablet as a product that sat somewhere between the laptop and the smartphone, excelling at tasks like browsing the web, reviewing photos and watching videos.\nFive years later, Mr. Jobs\u2019s successor, Timothy D. Cook, took the iPad a step further. Unveiling the iPad Pro, a souped-up tablet that worked with Apple\u2019s keyboard and stylus, heremarkedthat people would try the product and \u201cconclude they no longer need to use anything else, other than their phones.\u201d\nThat prediction has not appeared to come true. Many professionals say theyuse an iPad in addition to a personal computer, and sales of iPads have shrunk quarter after quarter for more than a year, an indication that hordes of people were not trading in their PCs for tablets just yet.\nThat situation is unlikely to change with Apple\u2019s newest iPad Pro, which will be released this week. The professional tablet, which comes in two screen sizes \u2014 10.5 or 12.9 diagonal inches \u2014 is incrementally improved from previous models. It is faster, with a brighter display and a higher refresh rate that makes motion look buttery smooth. In addition, the screen on the smaller iPad Pro has been enlarged slightly from 9.7 inches.\nBut after about a week of testing the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, I concluded that Apple\u2019s professional tablet still suffers from some of the same problems when compared with a laptop. Most important, keyboard typing is not comfortable, and some tasks are better done with a mouse than with a touch screen. In the end, I would still recommend a traditional laptop for most professionals.\nWhat Has Improved\nThe most significant improvement to the iPad Pro is speed. The new tablet is notably faster: In speed tests run with the app Geekbench, the new iPad Pro was roughly 50 percent faster than its predecessor.\nThat means if you upgrade from an iPad older than last year\u2019s model, you will get a tremendous speed increase. The speed boost makes the new iPad Pro better at intense tasks like juggling multiple apps, editing high-resolution photos and playing graphics-heavy games.\nThe new iPad Pros also include a higher screen refresh rate. That makes motion look smoother, which is noticeable when opening or closing apps and scrolling through documents or websites. It is also supposed to make some games look better, but as of this writing, game developers had yet to update their apps to support the higher refresh rate.\nThe other notable change is the increased screen size of the smaller iPad Pro. Apple slimmed down the bezel \u2014 or the border surrounding the screen \u2014 to make more room for the display; the tablet\u2019s body is also slightly larger and heavier. Over all, this is a better size for the smaller iPad Pro, partly because the increased size also gave room for Apple to make a slightly larger version of its physical keyboard, called Smart Keyboard.\nApple also made a nice improvement to its accessories for carrying and protecting the iPad Pro. It now sells a stylish $129leather sleevethat includes a holder for its stylus, Apple Pencil, which addresses a concern that people could easily lose the stylus. The sleeve is just roomy enough to also hold an iPad Pro with a Smart Keyboard cover folded over it.\nWhat Falls Short\nEnlarging the smaller iPad Pro was an effort to address the tablet\u2019s greatest weakness: typing. The Smart Keyboard is essentially a protective cover for the screen with a keyboard and magnet built into it. When you open it, the tablet rests on top of the keyboard, held in place by the magnet.\nHere\u2019s the problem: The Smart Keyboard is thin and the keys do not click well or feel as satisfying to type on as the keyboards on a MacBook Pro or MacBook Air; after a long period of typing, the Smart Keyboard felt flimsy. The keyboard for the 10.5-inch model is still small and cramped compared with a MacBook keyboard.\nThe other issue is ergonomics. Using the touch screen in combination with the Apple keyboard can be a pain on the wrist.\nSay, for example, you are using the keyboard to scroll through an email or website: If you want to open a link, you have to lift your hand away from the keyboard and tap the link. Or say you want to adjust the screen brightness or hit pause on a music track while typing: Both actions require reaching up and touching the screen. These keyboard-to-touch-screen reps get tiring.\nIn my experience, using a keyboard and trackpad on a laptop feels like a more comfortable combination for crunching through a busy day of emails, messages, documents, spreadsheets and calendar entries.\nThe other issues with the iPad are related to software and may be resolved this year. For example, you can have two apps open side by side with the iPad Pro. You can use each app independently, but the two apps cannot interact with each other easily: You cannot drag and drop a photo or file from one app to the other, for example. Fortunately, Apple is set to release a drag-and-drop feature this fall in iOS 11, its next mobile operating system. The operating system will also add the ability to display up to three apps at the same time and introduce a file system, which could make juggling tasks between applications easier.\nWho should buy one?\nIn its current state, the iPad Pro is in an awkward position among Apple\u2019s product lineup. A small set of professionals who do not do much typing \u2014 like artists and illustrators \u2014 could probably get away with using an iPad Pro with a stylus as a stand-alone computer. But most professionals would probably benefit from using a personal computer combined with a smartphone and tablet.\nThere is little reason to consider an iPad Pro, which starts at about $649, if you are not also planning to purchase the optional $159Apple Smart Keyboardor $99Apple Pencil. It would be overkill to spend that much on an iPad without the accessories.\nIf all you are looking for is a tablet for casual purposes like streaming Netflix, reading books or sending email, astandard iPadthat lacks compatibility with the Apple keyboard and stylus costs $329 and will be powerful enough to suit your needs. (Or you could just get a big-screen smartphone and skip tablets altogether.)\nAs for me, I must confess: I used the iPad Pro in research and outlining for this review. But when it came to writing it while reviewing notes simultaneously, I switched back to my MacBook Air, largely because the keyboard felt better to type on and it was easier to multitask with several apps."

        "title": "All the Ways Apple\u2019s iOS 11 Will Change Your iPhone",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s latest operating system for iPhones and iPads is set to roll out on September 19th, bringing with it a number of new features and tweaks that are designed to make your phone safer to use and more customizable.\niOS 11 was actually announced atApple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it also unveiled its new HomePod speaker, a competitor to Amazon\u2019s Echo, and unveiled a new iMac Pro, along with upgraded iMacs and MacBooks. Similarly, whenApple unveiled the iPhone 8 and iPhone Xlast week, they noted iOS 11 would roll out this week\u2014and ship on those newly announced phones. Here\u2019s a rundown of some of iOS 11\u2019s biggest features.\nWe all know how dangerous texting, or using your phone in general, while driving can be, but it doesn\u2019t stop people from thinking they can get away with it. Plus, buzzing alerts on your phone are distracting even if you don\u2019t look at them (and sometimes it seems like they never stop). Apple\u2019s next update will include a possible solution to that problem: It will automatically block notifications when your phone thinks you are behind the wheel.\nTexts sent via iMessage will also be intercepted. When one arrives, the phone will send an automatic reply saying you are driving and that you\u2019ll respond when you get to your destination. (You can program your phone to let some numbers through the blockade, so loved ones can reach you in a pinch.) When the phone has determined that you\u2019ve stopped driving, your screen will come back to life, and you can catch up on everything you\u2019ve missed.\nThe Control Center, that panel full of easily-accessed buttons and tools you see when you swipe up from the bottom of your iPhone screen, will also get an overhaul in the new update. Soon all the controls will be located on one colorful, widget-filled page.\nSome have complained that the new layout is confusing and cluttered, but it doesn\u2019t have to be: The Control Center will be customizable, so you can add as many (or as few) widgets as you like, including quick access to your camera, calculator or Apple TV.\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a new toggle for the iPhone\u2019s \u201cLow Power\u201d mode, designed to save battery life while you\u2019re out without a spot to charge your phone. The new Control Center also features quick accessibility settings, including options to magnify your screen, change the brightness, make text display larger (or smaller), enable Do Not Disturb mode, and more. And each setting now makes use of Apple\u2019s \u201c3D Touch\u201d feature, where pressing and holding on an icon brings up additional useful options.\nSiri, Apple\u2019s personal assistant program, will get an overhaul too. The company said the program will soon have \u201ca new, more natural voice\u201d that will be more \u201cexpressive\u201d than the robotic lilt it currently has. At the conference last week, some audio of both the male and female voices were played to showcase its more nuanced pronunciations. But the biggest changes for Siri will be under the hood, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nHere is what that means: Apple says Siri will learn so much from you that it will be able to anticipate your needs and make suggestions before you even ask for them.\nFor example, it will offer news stories based on things it has learned you like. If you\u2019re texting a friend about a film you saw or a place you visited, Siri will auto-type the name of the movie or the place. It will suggest new searches for you in Safari based on articles you\u2019ve read. It will automatically queue up songs you like, suggest songs it thinks you will like or answer trivia questions about songs you play.\nSiri is going to know a lot about you.\niOS 11 will also help save storage on your phone. When your storage runs low, a new optional feature will automatically remove apps you don\u2019t use very often. It is called \u201cOffload Unused Apps\u201d and you can turn it on by going to Settings, then tapping General. The selected apps are removed, and you get back all of the space they were using, which can be especially useful for people who\u2019ll need to make room for more photos, for phone updates, or just to download music or movies for a long flight.\nDon\u2019t worry, though. Your phone will keep any data you have associated with the deleted app, which will display as a gray icon after it has been removed. If you ever want to reinstall it, all you have to do is tap the gray icon and everything is back to the way it was.\n(Even before iOS 11 is released, users mayfind themselves receivingwarnings about some apps that have not kept pace with Apple\u2019s changes.)\nApple\u2019s mobile payment system, Apple Pay, will also get a boost with the new update. Using your credit or debit card, you will be able to send money to anyone who also uses iOS11 with just a text message, which can be especially useful for splitting the check at a restaurant, paying someone gas money, or even paying the rent if you\u2019re close with your landlord. You even get an electronic receipt that shows the payment went through.\nReceiving money from someone will be just as easy. Once you\u2019ve been paid via text message you can either use Apple Pay to spend that money at stores and online or you can transfer it to your bank account. Think of it as a version of Venmo that is restricted to (or especially for, depending on your perspective) Apple users. If you already use Apple Pay to pay for purchases at participating retailers, the ability to quickly send and receive money from other iPhone users may appeal to you. Unfortunately the feature won\u2019t be ready at launch,according to TechCrunch, but with a later release to iOS 11 coming this fall.\nThis article was initially published on June 12, 2017, and was updated on September 18th, 2017. It was updated again on September 20th to note that Apple Pay is not available at launch."

        "title": "Tech Titans Make Pilgrimage to White House to Discuss Government Systems",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Silicon Valley is fuming about President Trump\u2019s stance onclimateand immigration, but top technology executives still made a pilgrimage to the White House on Monday to discuss a potential upgrade of government technology.\nTimothy D. Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Eric Schmidt of Alphabet were among 18 tech executives and investors \u2014 many of whom havecriticizedthe Trump administration \u2014 who attended the four-hour afternoon session to discuss cloud computing and procurement systems run by government agencies.\nFor many, it was the second groupmeetingwith Mr. Trump since the election \u2014 and another demonstration of the administration\u2019s ability to summon top business executives, even amid controversy.\n\u201cGovernment needs to catch up with the technology revolution,\u201d said Mr. Trump, who strolled in at the end of the meeting to greet the tech titans. \u201cWe\u2019re going to change that with the help of great American businesses like the people assembled.\u201d\nHe later said, drawing laughter, \u201cWe have approximately $3.5 trillion of market value in this room \u2014 but that\u2019s almost the exact number that we\u2019ve created since my election.\u201d\nFew technology specialists from the White House attended. The administrationhas not filledseveral major science and technology positions. But the business and economics team closest to the president attended, including Gary D. Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, and Dina Powell, senior counselor for economic initiatives.\nThe event was organized by Jared Kushner, special adviser to the president and Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, and Chris Liddell, the White House director of strategic initiatives and former chief financial officer of Microsoft. Mr. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation brought together the executives for 10 workshops on topics such as cybersecurity, analytics and using technology to better connect people to government services.\nMr. Kushner opened the event in the White House Indian Peace Treaty room by emphasizing the potential of the companies to improve the government\u2019s outdated and inefficient technology systems.\n\u201cTogether we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before,\u201d he said.\nThe opportunity for Silicon Valley is enormous. The federal government spends $80 billion a year on information technology, much of it used to maintain outdated technology such as data systems that are decades old and storage that includes floppy disks used at the Defense Department. Federal agencies maintain 6,100 data centers that could be consolidated and moved to the cloud.\nThe meeting occurred as tech company stocks roared back after declining in the last two weeks, pushing the stock market to records on Monday. Apple and Alphabet, the parent of Google, were among the top gainers after three consecutive sessions of declines.\nThe tech industry has walked a delicate line in its engagement with the Trump administration. Some tech workers and customers have called on industry leaders to withdraw from positions as official advisers to the president. Uber\u2019s chief executive, Travis Kalanick,resignedas a White House adviser after protests by employees and users. Elon Musk, chief executive of SpaceX and Tesla, quit the White House business advisory council after the administration withdrew the United States from the Paris climate accord.\nMr. Musk did not attend the meeting Monday. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, was invited but declined because of a scheduling conflict, the company said.\nThe meeting occurred only weeks after tech executives, including Mr. Musk and Mr. Cook,publicly criticizedthe withdrawal from the Paris accord. But senior administration officials said they had not encountered any reluctance to participate in the event and had a waiting list for people who wanted to attend.\n\u201cThis is a double-edged sword for the tech C.E.O.s because they don\u2019t want to be window dressing and used for photo ops,\u201d said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor and associate dean at the Yale School of Management. \u201cBut on the other side, this is the most business-friendly administration since Eisenhower and is much more open than any administration to influence on the spot.\u201d\nAdministration officials said that the chief executives had done their homework and were engaged in the workshops and discussions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any one big suggestion,\u201d Mr. Liddell said in an interview. \u201cBut there was a large number of small suggestions, all of which are interesting for us to follow up.\u201d\nSeveral tech executives had a chance to address Mr. Trump in a round-table discussion at the end of the day.\nMr. Bezos encouraged the president to use commercial technology whenever possible. Amazon\u2019s booming cloud services business has become a contractor to the government. The Amazon founder also emphasized the need to retrain workers and said it was \u201cimpossible to overstate\u201d the importance of artificial intelligence.\nPeter Thiel, an early Trump supporter and tech investor, praised the president.\n\u201cYour administration is doing very well,\u201d he said.\nBrad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president,said on Twitterthat the company made the case \u201cfor why healthy high-skilled immigration and investments in education are good for the country.\u201d\nTwo people who were briefed on the tech meeting later said Mr. Trump also voiced support for \u201ccomprehensive\u201d immigration reform, a term that was used during the Obama administration to generally describe a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States.\nThe president made the promise, the two people said, after being told by Mr. Cook that tech employees may worry they are being targeted amid confusion over the administration\u2019s immigration policy. It was unclear exactly what the president meant, or if he was using the term to mean something else. White House press aides did not respond to a request for comment on Monday night, and a spokesman for Apple declined to comment.\nMr. Trump in February told a group of network anchors that he wasconsidering pushingsome form of comprehensive immigration reform package. But he never said it publicly or produced a proposal, and has taken a hard line against it immigration in speeches and public comments."

        "fulltext": "SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 One of Apple\u2019s greatest strengths is timing. The company that\u2019s hailed for innovation does not often invent things first \u2014 it didn\u2019t create the first personal computer, the first digital music player or the first smartphone. Instead, Apple reinvents, slipping in and producing something more original than what we used to use.\nOn paper, Apple is aiming to pull the same trick with a devicecalled HomePod. The $349 gadget \u2014 which Apple unveiled on Mondayat its annual developer conferenceand will begin shipping in December \u2014 is inspired by the Amazon Echo, the smart speaker that houses Amazon\u2019s virtual assistant, Alexa, and that seemed like a joke until many people (including yours truly) suddenly began to love it.\nApple\u2019s version ticks all the Apple-y boxes: It\u2019s very pretty; it\u2019s about twice the price of the Echo; and it has much better sound, including the ability to create a kind of surround sound customized to your room.\nYet the reinvention that matters here isn\u2019t about a single device \u2014 it\u2019s larger: The success of HomePod will really depend on whether Apple can reinvent itself.\nFor some time now, Apple has faced questions about its growth and what rabbits it can pull out of its hat next, especially as rivals including Google, Facebook and Amazon appear to have gotten the jump on it with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality andaugmented reality. The Apple iPhone remains the most profitable computing device in the world, and Apple\u2019s immediate future looks sunny, but its long-term outlook has begun to look partly cloudy. In a world that seems to care less and less about beautiful hardware and more about services that help you from afar, over the air, without your ever having to touch a machine, Apple risks becoming an anachronism.\nHomePod will be a test of how Apple responds to these difficulties. That\u2019s because for Apple to outdo Amazon in the home assistant game, it will need to prioritize skills that have long been on its back burner \u2014 cloud services and A.I., for instance.\nBut here\u2019s the surprising thing: Apple seems to be up for such reinvention. If you read between the lines at its keynote address on Monday, you would have noticed something. Again and again, like shamans calling on some new and powerful magic, Apple executives invoked the buzzwords of modern computing: \u201cmachine learning,\u201d \u201cdeep learning\u201d and \u201ccomputer vision.\u201d\nSubtly but unmistakably, they were suggesting a shift. Apple seems to be transforming itself into a new kind of company, one that prioritizes the nerdy technical stuff that will become the foundation of tomorrow\u2019s intelligent machines \u2014 whereas in the past, the company tended to hide this stuff, even if it recognized its importance.\nThis shift doesn\u2019t mean that HomePod will succeed, or that Amazon\u2019s device is in trouble; with a head start, much cheaper devices and lots of irrepressible fans, theEcho has momentumthat will be difficult to curb. Plus, nobody knows yet how well HomePod will work.\nIn broad strokes, the device seems to do much of what its rivals can. Say, \u201cHey Siri, play me some Carly Rae Jepsen,\u201d and it will belt out perfect Canadian pop. It will also answer questions about the music it\u2019s playing, and, just like the Echo, it can perform a wide variety of other functions \u2014 setting timers, telling you the weather and controlling your smart lights and other home devices.\nHomePod also lacks a lot that the Echo has perfected. For now, it seems bound to Apple\u2019s ecosystem. Apple said that it connects to its own subscription music service, but declined to specify whether it would let you play songs from Spotify or other services, or whether there was a way for third-party developers to create additional voice-activated functions, which is one of the best features of the Echo.Alexa can order an Uber for you; HomePod may ask you to try using your phone. And obviously, HomePod lacks the Echo\u2019s deep integration with Amazon\u2019s online store, which, to many users, is a killer feature: Running out of dish soap? Alexa will order it for you, but Siri can\u2019t.\nYet many of these are omissions that you\u2019d expect in a new device, and Apple will most likely add improvements in updates. What will matter most, at first, is how reliably HomePod can perform the basics.\nIf you\u2019re a longtime Siri user, your skepticism is warranted. The best thing about Amazon\u2019s speaker is its reliability: Say something from far away, even in a noisy room, and most of the time it will at least recognize what you asked it. Once you get an idea of the kinds of requests it can handle, Alexa begins to seem like a completely natural interface to computers. It responds so quickly that it starts to seem like a helpful member of the family rather than a computer in a can.\nCan Siri in HomePod do that? I can\u2019t tell you yet for certain. I got a chance to listen to HomePod \u2014 but not use any of its voice-activated features \u2014 after Apple\u2019s keynote. As the company promised, it does sound much deeper and richer than a Sonos Play 3 or an Amazon Echo, closer to what you might hear in a high-end home stereo system. But the true test for such a device is how it works in real-world conditions, handling the multiplicity of requests that you might think up during a day \u2014 and for now, we have no idea how that might work.\nYet I am cautiously optimistic, mainly on the basis of the many other computationally difficult features that Apple showed off on Monday. Many of them are versions of features that rivals like Google have spent years perfecting.\nFor example, Siri will now translate languages for you. Like a true assistant, Siri is also now more predictive \u2014 it aims to spot common computing problems and offer to help. (If it notices that you\u2019ve been chatting about a coming appointment, for instance, it will offer to add it to your calendar.)\nBest of all, Siri is finally a single unified personality that sits across all of your devices. In the past, Siri on your iPad was different from Siri on your Mac \u2014 one would learn that you\u2019re traveling to Iceland, and the other might never know. Now, similar to other assistants, Siri knows you and can anticipate your interests on whatever device you use.\nThere was more, too. Apple is letting developers create apps that can perform machine learning tasks on its devices. It\u2019s also diving heavily into computer vision. Developers can now create augmented reality features, meaning they can add virtual objects overlaid on images from the real world.\nIf you follow the tech industry you know these are all hot topics that other companies are investing in heavily. Apple is still a laggard, and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to beat Google in an A.I. contest anytime soon.\nBut it doesn\u2019t need to. All Apple has to do is stay competitive \u2014 it\u2019s got to invest just enough in the A.I.-driven future to keep its devices compelling. There\u2019s no mistake, now, that it\u2019s doing so."

        "title": "Q&A: What Apple Announced at WWDC",
        "fulltext": "ByBRIAN X. CHENJUNE 6, 2017\nAt Apple\u2019s annual conference for software developers this week, the iPhone maker announced brand-new iPads, iMacs and MacBooks along with a smart speaker featuring its voice assistant Siri. Apple also demonstrated new versions of its operating systems powering the iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch.Curious about Apple\u2019s announcements? Submit your questions here, and Brian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, will respond to some of the most notable ones.\nI have some questions about HomePod.1. Do I have to own an iPhone to have the HomePod?2. Will they release an SDK, or software development kit,  for developers to build on?3. Given that the HomePod is a home device, and people won't be able do the \"status bling bling thing,\" will Apple be able to sustain a play in this category or are they going to have the HomePod  just so that they will be able to say that they have one of those doodads?\nApple shared very few details about HomePod, its new smart speaker. But here\u2019s what we know about how the device works:\n1. Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant, will primarily work with Apple Music.\n2. The device will also play audio that is streamed over Wi-Fi from an iPhone using AirPlay, which means you can stream music from third-party apps like Spotify or Pandora to the speaker as long as you have an iPhone.\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that you will need an iPhone to use HomePod, but you will probably need at least an Apple Music account if you lack an iPhone.\nRegarding an SDK, Apple did not announce one for HomePod this week. But it\u2019s reasonable to expect one in the future.\nAs for whether HomePod will be successful, we will have to wait and see. The device\u2019s $329 price tag is exceptionally higher than Amazon\u2019s $180 Echo and Google\u2019s $129 Home. But HomePod\u2019s price is on par with the $299 Sonos Play:3. The Sonos products -- multispeaker systems designed to be spread throughout various rooms in the house -- are the most similar to HomePod, and the people who are willing to spend so much on Sonos products may be willing to splurge on HomePod.\nAre there any proposed upgrades to the iPad Mini, which is the entry-level and smallest iPad?\nThere were no updates for the iPad Mini at Monday\u2019s event. In March, Apple refreshed its iPad Mini 4, which was released in 2015, with larger storage capacity (128 gigabytes). Apple has said its larger 9.7-inch iPad tablet has been its hottest seller, so you can expect Apple to minimize updates for the smaller model in the future.\nRegarding the iPad Pro, why does Apple persist in not providing trackpad capability? This seems irrational to me.Without a trackpad/mouse capability, the device is not useful for those professionals who use spreadsheet software primarily. De facto, this then leaves out a very large portion of the professional user group - financial, engineering other related technical users.Touching that screen interminably in not going to cut it for these users. Your thoughts?\nAdding a trackpad to the iPad would practically turn it into a PC. Apple continues to distinguish its Mac and iPad products with user interfaces that rely on different ways to control them. Its Macs are controlled with a mouse and physical keyboard, and its iPads are primarily controlled with a touchscreen. However, to your point, the iPad is increasingly resembling the Mac, especially now that a physical keyboard is practically a must-buy if you get an iPad Pro. In addition, there is now a virtual trackpad mode in iPad: touch two fingers down on the keyboard to bring up a digital trackpad on the screen.\nWhat is the scoop on the iPhone 8? Are there any advancements and are they significant? The past few models appear to represent a plateau in the phone\u2019s development. There have been some software upgrades but besides the camera nothing big. What do you think?\nAccording to multiple sources, the next iPhone will reduce the borders, or bezel, surrounding the screen \u2014 so you will get a larger display in a compact body. This is the current design trend in the smartphone industry. The LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8, which were released this year, also featured thinner bezels.\nI have been debating whether or not an iPad Pro is a worthy investment ever since I acquired my MacBook Pro about a year ago. With iOS 11, would you argue that the iPad Pro can adequately perform as a 'substitute' laptop for those days when lugging a MacBook around isn't as appealing? Could you briefly recap what iOS 11 means for the iPad Pro world in terms of its functionality as an everyday work device?\nThe iPad\u2019s operating system is increasingly resembling that of a Mac. Most significantly, iOS 11 will include a file directory that lets you manage files similar to the Finder system on Mac. In addition, iOS 11 includes the ability to drag and drop items between multiple app screens, similar to the desktop interface of interacting with apps inside multiple windows. As for whether or not the iPad Pro replaces an everyday work computer, the jury is still out. We will have to wait and see when iOS 11 is officially released in fall, as well as what apps are available for iPad.\nOther than software, personally what makes me gravitate toward a laptop for work is simply what the word implies: it can sit on top of my lap more comfortably. Apple offers a detachable keyboard for iPad Pro, but a laptop\u2019s attached keyboard is always going to feel more solid and stable.\nWill there come a time when iPad Pro can run Photoshop?\nThe iPad Pro already runs Photoshop apps \u2014 just not the exact same software as what you are used to on a desktop. Adobetailored its softwareto be more suitable for mobile devices. Examples include iPad apps like Photoshop Express, Adobe Lightroom and PhotoShop Sketch.\nIs there any hope that Apple will move to support its professional users, perhaps by totally rethinking the design and upgradability of the Mac towers?\nMany of the announcements at the Apple conference were aimed at professional customers. Apple debuted a new iMac Pro, for one, which starts at $4,999 and can support up to an 18-core processor. Apple also once again upgraded its iPad Pro, its tablet for professionals. As for the Mac Pro tower, which is currently shaped like a cylinder, Apple has not updated that computer for nearly four years. In recent interviews with the news media, the company said the computer was a failure and that it was working on \u201csomething great to replace it.\u201d\nHi, Brian. I was looking at the MacBook Pro and when I saw the charger, only one question came to mind: What would Steve Jobs say, especially considering the commercials (Hi, I'm a Mac / I'm a PC) featured a PC in a wheelchair after being injured when someone tripped on the cord and pulled him off the desk?\nYou are referring to Apple\u2019s shift to USB-C, the modern standard for USB, and away from its proprietary magnetic charging port called MagSafe. Among many complaints, this was one of the most controversial changes about the new MacBook Pros.\nBased on conversations with employees, my understanding is that Apple made this decision for a number of reasons:\n1. The MacBook Pro batteries last so long now, so how often are you sitting around with the cord plugged into the computer anyway?\n2. The laptops keep getting lighter and lighter, and at some point tripping over the cord might still pull the computer off the desk even if it\u2019s connected with a magnet;\n3. The accessories industry is slowly transitioning into using USB-C for video, audio and power, so might as well go all in on this port now.\n(Personally, I will miss MagSafe as well and I still prefer the MacBook Air in part because of that charging port.)\nAnything on the Mac Mini?\nIt\u2019s easy to forget about the Mac Mini \u2014 the tiny box-shaped desktop computer -- which has not been upgraded since 2014. There were no updates for the mini computer announced at Monday\u2019s event, but in recent press interviews, Apple said the Mac Mini remains part of its portfolio, and it did not announce any plans to discontinue the device. In other words, there might be improvements made to the computer eventually, but it\u2019s tough to say when.\nCan I get some iMac advice? I\u2019m trying to gauge when to replace my current iMac, but unsure whom to trust.\nThe new standard iMacs ship this week and the next Mac operating system comes out this fall. It would be perfectly fine for you to get the new iMac now and download the next Mac system, a free update called High Sierra, when it arrives this fall.\nHowever, be wary that brand-new operating systems often have bugs, so I would advise you to wait a few months after High Sierra\u2019s release to make sure the coast is clear. And as always, make sure to back up your data before you upgrade to the next operating system.\nI need a new laptop. Should I wait?\nIf you are considering an Apple laptop, now is the time to get one. Apple refreshed each of its laptops: The MacBook, MacBook Air and MacBook Pro all got updates this week with improvements like speed increases. We probably will not see another update to the MacBook line for at least another year.\n\nAdvertisement"
