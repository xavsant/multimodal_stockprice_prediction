        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It took six years forAppleto persuade China\u2019s largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, to sell theiPhone. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, made repeated trips to China to meet with top government officials and executives to woo them personally.\nThe persistence paid off. In 2013,China Mobile relented, a moment Mr. Cook later described as \u201ca watershed day\u201d for Apple.\nToday, China is Apple\u2019s second-largest market after the United States \u2014 Chinese consumers spent $59 billion on Apple products in the last fiscal year \u2014 and the iPhone, the company\u2019s top seller, has become both a status symbol and a form of personal security, given how difficult the device is to break into in a country where people increasingly worry about hacking and cybercrime.\nApple\u2019s success in China helps explain why it is nowin a standoff with the United States governmentover whether to help officials gain access to the encrypted iPhone of one of the attackers in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting last December.\nThe company is playing the long game with its business. Privacy and security have become part of its brand, especially internationally, where it reaps almost two-thirds of its almost $234 billion a year in sales. And if it cooperates with one government, the thinking goes, it will have to cooperate with all of them.\n\u201cTim Cook is leveraging his personal brand and Apple\u2019s to stand on the side of consumer privacy in this environment,\u201d said Mark Bartholomew, a law professor at the University at Buffalo who studies encryption and cyberlaw. \u201cHe is taking the long view.\u201d\nMr. Cook, who has called privacya civic duty, said as much in aletterto Apple customers on Tuesday. He described how the United States government was asking for a special tool to break into the San Bernardino attacker\u2019s iPhone and said, \u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the remarks in Mr. Cook\u2019s letter.\nThe business advantage Apple may get from privacy has given critics an opening to attack the company.In a court filing on Friday, the Justice Department said Apple\u2019s opposition to helping law enforcement appeared \u201cto be based on its concern for its business model and public brand marketing strategy.\u201d\nApple senior executives responded that their defiance was not a business choice. They said there had not been any business fallout and that Mr. Cook had received supportive emails from customers across the country.\nIn fact, Apple has not made a point of advertising data security and privacy. The company has quietly built privacy features into its mobile operating system, known as iOS, over time. By late 2013, when Apple released its iOS 7 system, the company was encrypting by default all third-party data stored on customers\u2019 phones. And iOS8, which became available in 2014, made it basically impossible for the company\u2019s engineers to extract any data from mobile phones and tablets.\nMr. Cook has also been vocal about how Apple is pro-privacy, a message that he discussed more widely after revelations from the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden about government surveillance. Mr. Cook argued that the company sold hardware \u2014 phones, tablets and laptops \u2014 and did not depend on the mass collection of consumer data as some Silicon Valley behemoths, such as Google and Facebook, do for their advertising-oriented businesses.\nAt aconferencein October, Mr. Cook called privacy a \u201ckey value\u201d at Apple and said, \u201cWe think that it will become increasingly important to more and more people over time as they realize that intimate parts of their lives are sort of in the open and being used for all sorts of things.\u201d\nFor Apple, cooperating with the United States government now could quickly lead to murkier situations internationally.\nIn China, for example, Apple \u2014 like any other foreign company selling smartphones \u2014 hands over devices for import checks by Chinese regulators. Apple also maintains server computers in China, but Apple has previously said that Beijing cannot view the data and that the keys to the servers are not stored in China. In practice and according to Chinese law, Beijing typically has access to any data stored in China.\nIf Apple accedes to American law enforcement demands for opening the iPhone in the San Bernardino case and Beijing asks for a similar tool, it is unlikely Apple would be able to control China\u2019s use of it. Yet if Apple were to refuse Beijing, it would potentially face a battery of penalties.\nAnalysts said Chinese officials were pushing for greater control over the encryption and security of computers and phones sold in the country, though Beijing last year backed off on some proposals that would have required foreign companies to provide encryption keys for devices sold in the country after facing pressure from foreign trade groups.\n\u201cPeople tend to forget the global impact of this,\u201d said Raman Jit Singh Chima, policy director at Access Now, a nonprofit that works for Internet freedoms. \u201cThe reality is the damage done when a democratic government does something like this is massive. It\u2019s even more negative in places where there are fewer freedoms.\u201d\nGovernments in Russia, Britain and Israel also have robust surveillance operations. Some governments have tried to use technology to gather intelligence on citizens at home and abroad.\nApple\u2019s resistance to the United States government\u2019s demand has been polarizing. Apple supporters have held protests in cities like San Francisco in recent days to show their support of the company and have used hashtags on social media like #freeapple and #beatthecase.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting to maintain even the assumption that companies should protect us,\u201d said Evan Greer, the campaign director at Fight for the Future, a civil liberties group that is organizing protests nationwide on Tuesday to support Apple. \u201cApple is doing what every company should be doing.\u201d\nOthers,including the Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump, have criticized Apple, and Mr. Trump has suggested boycotting its products.\nAround the world, people are aware of the impasse but many say it does not affect their decision to buy iPhones and the company\u2019s other products. In Rome on Friday, Simone Farelli, a 34-year-old history teacher who was browsing for a new iPhone at an Apple Store, said she \u201cdidn\u2019t see why\u201d the company\u2019s standoff with the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u201cwould change my mind about buying a new phone.\u201d\nIn China, the iPhone continues to hold a special place as a symbol of middle-class status.\nWen Shuyue, a 35-year-old consultant, who on Friday was waiting outside the Apple Store in Beijing\u2019s upscale Sanlitun district, is one of Apple\u2019s millions of Chinese users. He said he liked the iPhone because it was simply better than models made by Chinese companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never used Xiaomi or Huawei, because I think their designs are rough and not all that personal,\u201d he said.\nApple\u2019s shareholders have so far been quiet. In the past, investors who complained that some of Apple\u2019s socially driven initiatives were superfluous to the company\u2019s core business were quickly subdued. At a 2014 shareholders\u2019 meeting, Mr. Cook told investors that if they wanted him to make decisions based only on the bottom line, \u201cthen you should get out of the stock.\u201d\nBut data privacy may eventually motivate investors \u2014 and ultimately more customers \u2014 to vote with their wallets because \u201cit\u2019s an issue that speaks directly to the business,\u201d said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. \u201cRight now people buy phones regardless of encryption issues, but we have to wait and see how bloody this fight gets.\u201d"

        "title": "Should the Authorities Be Able to Access Your iPhone?",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As a legal matter,the showdownbetween the Obama administration and Apple touched off Tuesday by the ruling of a federal magistrate judge in California turns on an 18th century law. More practically, though, it boils down to this question: Should you be able to lock your phone so securely that even the F.B.I. cannot open it?\nThe Obama administration and police officers around the country say no, and their precedent is the past. Homes and cars do not have unbreakable locks. You cannot buy an uncrackable safe. And terrorists and child molesters should not be able to buy a hand-held computer that keeps its secrets forever.\nApple, backed by technologists and civil libertarians, says yes. People live their lives electronically; their phones are a record of loves and fantasies, illnesses and losses. Apple built its recent iPhones to keep that data private and says nothing less than the future of privacy is at stake in this fight.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s success in obtaining a court order demanding that Apple help write software to disable those defenses was a significant victory for the Obama administration. It relied on theAll Writs Act, a law that can trace its origins to the first Congress in 1789. In short, it says courts can require that people do things to comply with their orders.\nFor months, the Justice Department and Apple have been trading heated rhetoric and lurching toward this very confrontation, only to back away. By the end of last year, it seemed that Apple and other technology companies had won the public relations battle.\nThe attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., in December, however, changed the government\u2019s calculation. Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two people suspected of killing 14 people, left behind an iPhone 5c \u2014 a locked one. The F.B.I. has not been able to get access to any data on it.\nFor the administration, it was perhaps the perfect test case, one that put Apple on the side of keeping secrets for a terrorist.\nMr. Farook\u2019s phone is protected by a password that Apple says it does not keep. It is encrypted with an algorithm the company says it cannot break. The F.B.I. wants to write a computer program to send the phone an unlimited combination of passwords until it finds one that works.\nBut Apple built its phones to protect against that tactic. Each wrong guess causes a short delay, which would significantly slow the F.B.I.\u2019s effort. After too many incorrect guesses, the phone will automatically erase its memory.\nThere is little middle ground between the positions of the Justice Department and Apple, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, did not back down. He issued a sharply worded statement on Wednesday, saying he planned to fight the order. He said the Obama administration was not only creating a dangerous precedent but was demanding the creation of a dangerous tool \u2014 a skeleton key that could be used by hackers and totalitarian governments.\n\u201cOnce the information is known, or a way to bypass the code is revealed, the encryption can be defeated by anyone with that knowledge,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThe government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that\u2019s simply not true. Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.\u201d"

Many of these authorities have been sounding the alarm that Apple\u2019s iPhones, which use encryption, are counterproductive to investigations because information cannot be accessed.

        "fulltext": "The clash between federal law enforcement and Apple mirrors the divide in public opinion between the desire for security from terrorism and the fear of losing basic civil liberties.\nWhile public opinion has fluctuated in the last 15 years \u2014 often rising and falling depending on the immediacy of terrorist attacks \u2014 the most recent poll findings have shown a close divide in the public\u2019s concern over terrorism versus privacy.\nACBS News pollconducted after the Paris terrorist attacks in late November found majorities of Americans regardless of their party affiliation are concerned about losing their privacy as a result of the federal government\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism. The survey found 54 percent of the public said they were very or somewhat concerned about the loss of privacy, while 44 percent were not very concerned or not at all concerned.\nAmericans were asked in the same poll whether they were more concerned that the government would fail to enact strong antiterrorism laws or that the government would enact measures that would excessively restrict their civil liberties. By 46 percent to 40 percent, Americans said they were more apprehensive that the government would fail to enact strong antiterrorism laws.\nRepublicans in the survey were more supportive of strong antiterrorism laws and less concerned about loss of civil liberties than Democrats were.\nThere has not yet been polling on the specific issue of whether Apple should unlock the cellphone of a presumed terrorist, but Pew Research Center/GfKsurveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 found that most Americans thought there were insufficient limits on the telephone and Internet data that the government collects.\nAbout nine in 10 Americans placed importance on maintaining personal privacy in a range of daily activities.\nIt remains to be seen whether the public\u2019s opinion of Apple will be affected by the dispute, but several polls in recent years have foundfavorability ratingsof the company are high (considerably higher than those for Congress or President Obama).\nA poll by Langer Research Associates for The Washington Post and ABC News in 2013, for example, found more than seven of 10 Americans expressed a favorable opinion of Apple."

Cook, called for a public discussion about privacy rights.\nThe topic ignited aheated debate on nytimes.comand on The Times\u2019s social media accounts. Nearly 5,000 comments had been submitted (as of 1 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday) on related articles and on The Times\u2019s Facebook page.\n\u25a0Readers were split over their answers to the question: Should the government be able to unlock your iPhone?\n\u201cSo let me get this straight: If Apple was the proprietor of a storage locker facility, and the government obtained a court-issued warrant to search the locker of a criminal suspect, Apple would not unlock the storage unit subject to the government\u2019s warrant?\u201d wroteChadin Oregon.\nRich Comstocksaid on Facebook: \u201cSwitch out iPhone and replace it with the word \u2018house.\u2019 If two suspected felons were wanted for murder and the F.B.I. or police felt there was compelling (and corroborating) evidence located at the house, they would place these facts before a judge to obtain a legal and appropriate search warrant \u2014 all coming under the Fourth Amendment and Miranda rights.\u201d\nBenjamin Caseyreplied, \u201cActually the F.B.I. is asking for the keys to everyone\u2019s house and cameras inside to see what\u2019s going on all the time.\u201d\njonnyballgamein New York City wrote: \u201cThink of it this way: If a manufacturer of toy chests was ordered by the government to give it a master key so it could open the toy chest of a terrorist in order to conduct a validly issued search warrant, would we really think that company was standing up for liberty, or would we think they were exploiting the issue to be difficult and give the optics of being on the side of \u2018liberty\u2019 (and to help undermine Google\u2019s massive worldwide market share)?\u201d\n\u25a0Many readers agreed that the F.B.I.\u2019s request to access the iPhone could set a dangerous precedent.\nFredd,in Denver, who said he had over 30 years experience working in the software and database industry, wrote: \u201cIf you provide a back door, it\u2019s only a matter of time before nefarious people exploit it. \u2026 All the government will end up doing is to weaken security for tens of millions to catch a few, and it won\u2019t be long before those few figure out how to write their own encryption to circumvent the back door problem.\u201d\nScipio,in Washington, agreed:\u201cThis is indeed a testament to Apple\u2019s incredibly strong encryption.\u201d\n\u25a0Not everyone was so quick to simply side with Apple.\nMatthew Schenker, who called himself a \u201ccoder,\u201d suggested that there was a way to satisfy both the F.B.I. and the technology company.

For example, Apple could create a temporary, self-destructing device ID that must be issued from Apple and is only accessible within a certain time frame, and with a certain algorithm.

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The legal wrangling overa federal court order requiring Apple to help law enforcementbreak into an iPhone intensified Thursday, with the company filing its formal response and asking the court to drop its demand.\nOther technology companies \u2014 Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Yahoo \u2014 also moved to throw their weight behind Apple in court. The companies said they planned to file one or more briefs backing Apple next week in federal court in California.\nThe flurry of legal activity by the companies came as the F.B.I. also escalated the matter, calling on Congress to settle the question of when law enforcement should get access to citizens\u2019 private data.Apple earlier this weekhad also asked for Congress to step in.\n\u201cThe larger question isn\u2019t going to be answered in the courts, and shouldn\u2019t be,\u201d James B. Comey Jr., the F.B.I. director, said in a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s really about who do we want to be as a country and how do we want to govern ourselves.\u201d\nThe day\u2019s events were among the most active yet in a case set in motion last week by Magistrate JudgeSheri Pymof the Federal District Court for the Central District of California. Judge Pym ordered Apple to weaken its security functions so the United States government could unlock theiPhoneused by one of the gunmen in amass shooting in Decemberin San Bernardino, Calif., to help the investigation. Apple immediately said it opposed the order, prompting a heated back-and-forth in a situation fueling a debate over privacy and civil liberties versus security.\nThe fight is an important moment in the growing tension between tech companies that have access to huge amounts of private customer data and the government, which has long sought greater access to that information. Apple has said customer data must remain accessible only to customers to protect their civil liberties. Law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey say that increasingly robust encryption technology is hurting their ability to fight criminals.\nThe case may eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has said, \u201cWe would be prepared to take this issue all the way.\u201d\nIn Apple\u2019s formal response to the court on Thursday, which was filed a day ahead of a Friday deadline, the company said the court should drop its order because it oversteps an existing law known as the All Writs Act, as well as Apple\u2019s First Amendment and Fifth Amendment rights.\n\u201cApple strongly supports, and will continue to support, the efforts of law enforcement in pursuing justice against terrorists and other criminals \u2014 just as it has in this case and many others,\u201d the company said in its filing, known as a motion to vacate. \u201cBut the unprecedented order requested by the government finds no support in the law and would violate the Constitution.\u201d\nApple added that the order had broad implications that would \u201cinflict significant harm \u2014 to civil liberties, society and national security \u2014 and would pre-empt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the president.\u201d\nSpecifically, Apple argued that the All Writs Act, a statute from 1789 that the governmenthas used in the pastto request user data from Apple, does not give the court the power it seeks in this case. While the F.B.I. has previously used the All Writs Act to obtain information from Apple, the company said \u201cCongress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the F.B.I.\u201d\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said investigators had long held the power to secure court orders that compel outside parties like Apple to assist with search warrants.\n\u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s approach to investigating and prosecuting crimes has remained the same,\u201d said Melanie Newman, the department spokeswoman. \u201cThe change has come in Apple\u2019s recent decision to reverse its longstanding cooperation in complying with All Writs Act orders.\u201d\nApple also argued that if the government forced it to create new code to unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino gunman, that would amount to \u201ccompelled speech and viewpoint discrimination,\u201d both of which are violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. The company also said the court order violated the company\u2019s Fifth Amendment right to due process because it deprives Apple of the right to be free from \u201carbitrary deprivation\u201d of its liberty by government.\nLegal experts said it was unlikely that a judge would rely on constitutional arguments to make a decision in this early stage. \u201cBut given the likelihood that this will move to an appeals court and even further, Apple needs to include all of its arguments in the lower court if it wants to raise them again in a higher court,\u201d said Larry Downes, project director at the Georgetown Center for Business and Public Policy.\nEven as Apple was preparing to formally respond to the court, other technology companies \u2014 which have until now been cautious in their support of Apple \u2014 were preparing to be more forceful in court. Earlier Thursday, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, Brad Smith, speaking at a congressional hearing tangentially related to the Apple case, said the software maker would file a brief backing Apple next week.\nMr. Smith in particular took aim at the All Writs Act, which was passed in its current form in 1911, as being too antiquated to be used now in situations with modern technology. To emphasize his point that law enforcement authorities are relying on outdated laws, he placed on a table an adding machine from the early 1900s that he had purchased on eBay.\n\u201cThe leading computing device from that era is right in front of me,\u201d he said.\nPress officials from Google, Facebook and Twitter confirmed that the tech companies would be filing a joint brief supporting Apple. Yahoo said it also would file a brief.\nLast week, Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, wrote on Twitter that law enforcement demands to hack customer devices and data \u201ccould be a troubling precedent.\u201d Jack Dorsey, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, also wrote on Twitter in support of Apple. This week, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg,also saidhe supported Apple.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think building back doors is the way to go, so we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to Tim and Apple,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said.\nIt is unlikely that a divided, gridlocked Congress will offer clear answers to questions about security and privacy anytime soon. Several lawmakers who questioned Mr. Comey on Thursday said that they weren\u2019t sure where to draw the line between consumer privacy and the needs of law enforcement.\nObama administration officials had drafted legislation in 2011 that sought to address the privacy issues now being raised, but the proposals were effectively shelved after the former government contractor Edward J. Snowden leaked information about the government\u2019s mass surveillance programs.\nNext Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee will hold ahearingtitled \u201cThe Encryption Tightrope: Balancing Americans\u2019 Security and Privacy.\u201d Those set to testify include Bruce Sewell, Apple\u2019s general counsel, along with Mr. Comey and the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr."

Law enforcement officials described him as stung by what they called Mr. Cook\u2019s \u201crant,\u201d although tech executives in the room insisted that Apple\u2019s chief executive was respectful.\nEither way, what started as a cordial two-hour discussion about combating Islamic extremism ended with the White House and Mr. Cook agreeing to disagree \u2014 foreshadowing a bitter battle between a president long enamored of Apple products and Silicon Valley and a tech titan who has spoken enthusiastically of Mr. Obama.\nAlthough the president and Mr. Cook are not personal friends, associates say they have developed a relationship of professional admiration and mutual self-interest. At the least, the two share similar traits: discipline, a cerebral nature and impatience with office drama. Now they find themselves in roles no one ever imagined, as the central antagonists in the raging debate between personal privacy and the nation\u2019s security.\nBy refusing demands from Mr. Obama\u2019s Justice Department to help unlock a phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists, Mr. Cook has become the leading voice in Silicon Valley for encryption. By voicing strong support for his F.B.I., Mr. Obama is now the effective chief prosecutor of the administration\u2019s case for allowing law enforcement to penetrate iPhones.\nIf Apple had more of a presence in Washington, as do Google, Facebook and Microsoft, technology executives say there is a chance the dispute might have been quietly resolved. But few top Apple veterans have moved through the revolving door that has brought engineers and executives from other technology companies to the Obama White House to serve in a variety of security, technology and scientific positions. Apple\u2019s lobbying budget in Washington is far smaller than its competitors\u2019.\n\u201cI have not talked to the president. I will talk to the president,\u201d Mr. Cook said in an interview with ABC News last week, a day before his company filed legal papers opposing the government. Mr. Cook said he planned to ask Mr. Obama \u201cfor his help in getting this on a better path.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman said he had no idea when such a call might happen, and White House officials offered no indication that Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook were scheduled to talk anytime soon.\nIt is unclear when Mr. Obama and Mr. Cook first met, but in the four years since Mr. Cook succeeded Steven P. Jobs as Apple\u2019s chief executive, he has visited the White House at least a half-dozen times.\nIn the summer of 2013, soon after Edward J. Snowden revealed some of the government\u2019s most secret surveillance programs, Mr. Cook joined 16 other technology executives and privacy advocates for a grievance session with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room. Two participants said Mr. Cook told the president that the Snowden revelations had led people to believe that Apple was helping the government spy on Americans.\nThe exchange was an early indication of the tensions with the White House that would eventually develop.\n\u201cHe was concerned about the misperception in the public about the extent to which Apple was cooperating,\u201d recalled Larry Lessig, a Harvard law professor and privacy activist, who was also at the meeting.\nFour months later, Mr. Cook attended another meeting with Mr. Obama in the Roosevelt Room on a similar topic. The following year, in December 2014, White House visitor logs show that Mr. Cook spent two days in the West Wing, where he met with Mr. Obama in the Oval Office and shared a meal in the White House mess with John D. Podesta, who was then counselor to Mr. Obama as well as the president\u2019s environmental czar.\nIn September 2015, Mr. Cook was again at the White House, where he had a prime seat at the state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China.\nCurrent and former White House officials say Mr. Obama appreciated the attention that Mr. Cook brought to issues like immigration, gay marriage and climate change. When Mr. Obama solicited Apple and other companies to support his ConnectED program for technology in schools, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Cook\u2019s decision to pledge $100 million worth of iPads and MacBooks, calling it \u201can enormous commitment.\u201d\nThere were also tensions. White House officials were not happy about Apple\u2019s decision to shelter billions of dollars in offshore accounts and have repeatedly pressed Mr. Cook to explain the company\u2019s need to build its blockbuster products in China rather than in the United States.\nBut the encryption debate, and the government\u2019s legal action against Apple last week, are testing the relationship with the company more than any other.\n\u201cA company thinks very hard before it defies the government,\u201d said Nicole Wong, who was Google\u2019s lead lawyer when Google resisted a Justice Department request for user data. But if a disagreement happens, \u201cit\u2019s not bad for this policy conversation to happen transparently in a court proceeding.\u201d\nAt the same time, there was a growing alliance between this White House and Silicon Valley. Although other presidents have looked to the valley\u2019s innovators and venture capitalists for money, political support and ideas, this administration has wooed tech executives in far greater numbers. The president also has close ties to those in the industry who supported him early on, including Reed Hastings, the Netflix chief executive, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn.\nNow, while Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are expected to file papers to the court in solidarity with Apple\u2019s encryption position, Mr. Cook stands relatively alone in his fight. This was evident at the meeting in January in Silicon Valley.\nAs participants recalled it, Mr. Cook was the one who shifted the conversation to encryption \u2014 prompting nods of agreement from executives at Dropbox, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nSoon after, Mr. McDonough brought the meeting to an end. \u201cPut a pin in it,\u201d participants recalled that he said, making it clear that the conversation would continue.\nBut one month later, the Justice Department moved against Apple."

        "title": "Analyzing Apple\u2019s Argument That First Amendment Applies to Its Code",
        "fulltext": "Computer code is incomprehensible to anyone without programming skills, butApple arguedina court filingon Thursday that code is a form of speech. So, the company contends, the government\u2019s order to crack a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino killers would violate Apple\u2019s First Amendment rights.\nApple, its lawyers contend, \u201cwrote code for its operating system that reflects Apple\u2019s strong view about consumer security and privacy.\u201d Changing its code, they add, would \u201cundermine those values\u201d \u2014 a position that raises several legal questions.\nQ. What is the legal argument?\nA.\u201cThe basic concept is that computer code is a way of expressing an idea,\u201d said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami.\nApple elaborates on that essential notion by saying that its code is expressing its corporate viewpoint on consumer security and privacy. If it loses this case, Apple suggests, the company would be forced to have its code change its digital tune \u2013 and corporate message.\n\u201cApple goes pretty far by saying its software has a viewpoint,\u201d said Ryan Calo, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty novel here. But this case is unprecedented, so we shouldn\u2019t be surprised by novel defenses.\u201d\nQ. How unusual is Apple\u2019s argument?\nA.There are a number of cases in which the issue has come up. Most often, the technology has involved computer security and encryption software, similar to the current case.\nIn the 1990s, the National Security Agency wanted American computer makers to build a hardware \u201cback door,\u201d known as a Clipper Chip, that could be unlocked by the government. First Amendment and other protests were made, and the government eventually backed down. The Clipper Chip episode was not litigated.\nA case that was taken to court involved Daniel J. Bernstein, who was a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, when he wrote an encryption program called \u201cSnuffle.\u201d At the time, the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations were expansively interpreted, and the government took the stance that even academics, like Mr. Bernstein, presenting or publishing research abroad were criminals. Mr. Bernstein filed suit.\nBut a Federal District Court in Northern California ruled in Mr. Bernstein\u2019s favor in 1996, agreeing that his code was speech and protected by the First Amendment. The export controls as applied to encryption software were eased later.\nIn its filing, Apple cited the Bernstein case, among others, and declared it was \u201cwell-settled law\u201d that computer code is protected speech.\nQ. But is Apple\u2019s argument surprising?\nA.No, legal experts say. Apple has signed up Theodore B. Olson as a key member of its legal team. A renowned litigator, Mr. Olson successfully argued before the Supreme Court that money is a form of free speech in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.\nGood lawyers make every plausible argument they can, and this one is certainly plausible.\nQ. How might the government reply?\nA.Mr. Froomkin of the University of Miami said the government would probably make two points. First, he said, the Supreme Court has never ruled that code is speech. Second, Mr. Froomkin said that the government might contend that Apple was going too far in its claim. \u201cThe government will tell Apple, \u2018You\u2019re not being denied the ability to speak,\u2019 \u201d he said."
