        "title": "Apple\u2019s New Devices Target Markets Led by Smaller Rivals",
        "fulltext": "Appleunveiled a series of new products on Tuesday that showed how it continues to center its marketing pitch on consumer privacy, at the potential expense of other companies, while muscling into markets pioneered by much smaller competitors.\nIn anhourlong infomercial that was streamed from its Silicon Valley headquarters, Apple showed off a new high-end iPad and an iMac desktop computer based on new computer processors that Apple now makes itself. The company also said it was redesigning its podcast app, which competes with companies like Spotify, to enable creators to charge for their shows. And it revealed theAirTag, a $29 disc that attaches to key rings or wallets so they can be found if lost.\nBut after its product show, Apple made other news that could have far more significant, industrywide implications. The company said in a news release that it planned to release highly anticipated iPhone software next week witha privacy feature that worries digital-advertising companies, most notably Facebook.\nThe feature will require apps to get explicit permission from users before tracking them across other apps. As a result, when opening many apps next week, owners of iPhones will see pop-up windows that ask them whether to allow that tracking. Companies that rely on digital advertising are expected to gather less data about users as people decline that tracking.\nApple and Facebook have beenlocked in a war of wordsover the change, with Facebook arguing that it will hurt the digital advertising that helps fund free internet services. Apple has said it is merely giving consumers the right to choose whether to be tracked.\nCompanies like Facebook often rely on details about users and their online behavior to show them advertising that is intended to be tailored to their interests. If Apple\u2019s changes strip the companies of that information, advertisers could be less willing to spend money with them.\nOn Tuesday,Apple\u2019s AirTagimmediately drew criticism from Tile, a company that for years has made similar devices for finding lost items. \u201cWe welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition,\u201d said CJ Prober, Tile\u2019s chief executive. \u201cUnfortunately, given Apple\u2019s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we\u2019re skeptical.\u201d\nTile has accused Apple of anticompetitive practices since Apple began working on a competing product. Last year, Tile\u2019s general counseltestified to Congressthat, shortly after reports that Apple was working on similar gadgets surfaced, Apple pulled Tile\u2019s devices from its stores and made it more difficult for them to work with iPhones.\nTile\u2019s general counsel, along with executives from Apple, Google, Spotify and the dating company Match Group, is set to testify on Wednesday ata Senate hearingon Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s market power and control over mobile apps.\n\u201cWe think it is entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple\u2019s business practices,\u201d Mr. Prober said.\nApple has faced scrutiny in recent years forits strict control over its App Store, including Apple\u2019s practice of forcing apps to use its payment system, which allows it to collect a commission of up to 30 percent on many app sales.\nThat policy has fueled a multibillion-dollar business, but also brought Appleregulatory headaches, including Wednesday\u2019s hearing andlegislative fights in several states. Next month, Apple is set to face off ina trial against Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, which is suing Apple over its App Store policies.\nAs part of its announcements on Tuesday, Apple said it was redesigning its podcast app, which now offers millions of shows, up from 3,000 when Apple introduced the service 16 years ago. Starting next month, creators can sell subscriptions to their podcasts, Apple said. It was unclear if Apple would take a cut of those sales, but that has been its approach when pushing into new industries, including in apps, music and news.\nThe subscription service will put Apple in even more direct competition with Spotify, which has been working on its own podcast subscriptions. Spotify has been a leading critic of Apple in recent years. The music service\u2019s business depends up reaching listeners through iPhones, putting the company at Apple\u2019s whim. Spotify has filed antitrust complaints against Apple in Europe and has complained about the company to American regulators.\nApple also showed off a series of slimmer, faster and more colorful iMacs. The desktop computers, which have 24-inch screens, range in price from $1,300 to $1,700. Apple also unveiled its new iPad Pro, its top-of-the-line tablet, with a sharper screen, faster speeds and the ability to connect to 5G wireless networks. The iPad will cost between $800 and $1,100.\nApple\u2019s other announcements on Tuesday included an update to its branded credit card that would allow spouses to build credit together, and improvements to its Apple TV devices, such as a new remote and faster processor that will make video play more smoothly."

        "fulltext": "Parler, the social networkpopular with conservatives, is making its comeback.\nThe app had beenkicked off iPhones, Android devices and even the internetin January after tech companies said Parler had not effectively policed content on the network around the time of the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6.\nBut on Monday,Applesaid in a letter to two federal lawmakers that it had approved Parler\u2019s return to iPhones because the app had agreed to more aggressively patrol what its users posted, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times.\nAn Apple lobbyist said in the letter that the iPhone maker had removed Parler from the App Store in January because it wasn\u2019t taking down \u201cposts that encouraged violence, denigrated various ethnic groups, races and religions, glorified Nazism, and called for violence against specific people.\u201d\nSince then, Apple employees have \u201cengaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance.\u201d Last week, Apple told Parler that it was welcome back because of changes it had agreed to make to the app, the lobbyist said in the letter. Parler would return to the App Store when it submitted its new app, he said.\nParler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.\nParler\u2019s return to iPhones followsthe revival of its websiteafter it went offline for about a month. Amazon had pulled support for Parler\u2019s social network in January, forcing its website to go dark. Parler came back online in February with the help of a small web-hosting company near Los Angeles called SkySilk.\nSince then, some users have returned to Parler, but it appears there is less overall activity on the social network since the time of the election. Most of the conversation around Parler revolved around politics, and the user base was overwhelmingly supportive of former President Donald J. Trump. Executives at Parler, includingits co-owner Rebekah Mercer, the conservative donor, hope the iPhone app can help the social network regain steam."

        "title": "What\u2019s Behind the Apple-Facebook Feud?",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nStarting on Monday, people with iPhones will begin to see pop-up messages on their screens asking whether they will permit companies to follow them from app to app.\nCurrently,Facebookand companies like it track the ways people use their phones, picking up bits of information such as how often they open their yoga app and what they buy at Target. Facebook then uses that information to help companies target their ads.\nApplesays that it wants people to have a choice about participating in this information-harvesting system.Facebooksays these ads help make the internet free for all. These two companieshave incompatible views of the future of digital life, and they really don\u2019t like each other, as my colleagues Mike Isaac and Jack Nicas detailed.\nJack talked to me about why we should pay attention to a fight between two tech giants, and which company is right. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re both a little right, and a little gross.\nShira: What does this new iPhone feature do, and why is Facebook so mad about it?\nJack:With the latest iPhone software update, companies and advertisers must ask explicit permission \u2014 in the form of yes-or-no messages that pop up on the screen \u2014 totrack people from one app to another.\nMany app companies, including Facebook, havepredictedthat large numbers of people will say no. And that means companies that rely on showing people online ads may haveless data to fine tune the adsbased on our activity and interests.\nWhy should people care about this long-runningbeef between Apple and Facebook?\nThe winner could decide the shape of the consumer internet going forward. Apple\u2019s view is that people should pay a premium, often to Apple, to have a private, safe experience in digital spaces. Facebook\u2019s position is that the internet should remain open and free, and that advertisers have made that possible.\nSo who\u2019s right: Apple or Facebook?\nEach companyhas a point, and each one is also hypocritical.\nFacebook is right that billions of people have been able to get access to social networks, email, news and entertainment because they\u2019repaid for by ads. The company\u2019s message is that this system needs data on us to advertise effectively and efficiently.\nAnd Apple is right that digital advertising largely operateswithout people\u2019s true consent or knowledge.\nApple\u2019s message seems simpler.\nThat\u2019s true. Apple\u2019s view is that it\u2019s simply giving people a choice of whether to be tracked across apps or not. Facebook\u2019s argument to the public is more complex \u2014 that they have to be tracked for the internet to work, and that people don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them.\nWait, let\u2019s go back to the hypocrisy part.\nFacebook is worried about its own profits being hurt by Apple\u2019s new feature. It has mostly focused, though, on making the smaller businesses that advertise on Facebookthe face of its oppositionto Apple\u2019s app-tracking feature. Yes,smaller companies could be hurt, but it\u2019s fair to ask whether my local pizzeria needs to know what I\u2019m doing on a fitness app to effectively advertise to me.\nAnd Apple won\u2019t admit that what it\u2019s doing is great for the company, not just iPhone owners. It\u2019s good marketing to be able to say that iPhones are the place for privacy. Apple also says that targeted digital advertising is dangerous, but it getsbillions of dollars each year from Google, the biggest targeted ad company.\nIs it possible that this iPhone app-tracking feature won\u2019t be a big deal?\nTo be honest, yes. It\u2019s not easy to predict the impact of this iPhone change or whether companies will counter it withdifferent information-gathering methods. There\u2019s a chance that lots of people say no to app tracking when iPhones offer the choice, but the advertising industry keeps chugging along.\nTip of the Week\nBrian X. Chen, the consumer technology columnist for The New York Times, is here to guide us through new capabilities for Siri that are also part of the updated iPhone software:\nInmy latest column, I dived into some of the most notable new features in Apple\u2019s iOS 14.5, the software update for iPhones and iPads that Apple plans to release on Monday. (Look for the update in the Settings app and the \u201cSoftware Update\u201d menu.)\nBut there\u2019s lots of other new goodies in the updated software focused on Siri, Apple\u2019s voice assistant.\nFor one, you can now ask Siri to call your emergency contact. To set someone as an emergency contact, open the Health app, tap on your picture and select Medical ID. In this menu, you can add an emergency contact from your address book. Now when you say, \u201cHey Siri, call my emergency contact,\u201d it will ring the phone of that person.\n\nAlso, for fans of Apple Maps \u2014 I know there are some of you out there \u2014 you can now report a road accident that will pop up for other Maps users by saying, \u201cHey Siri, there\u2019s a crash up ahead.\u201d\nInternet slander is big business:My colleagues Aaron Krolik and Kashmir Hill found that people running websites that smear people\u2019s reputations online are often also the same people selling services to delete those lies.Follow along as they unravel the slander industry.\nSilencing criticism of India\u2019s pandemic management:India againordered internet companies to block some posts that were critical of the government, this time over its handling of the deadly coronavirus surge in the country. My colleagues Karan Deep Singh and Paul Mozur reported that Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are faced with an unappealing choice of silencing people or defying the government.\nModern life with less damage to the planet:Tim Heffernan at Wirecutter, The Times\u2019s product recommendation site, hastipson more environmentally conscious online shopping, including ordering several items at once and choosing slower delivery when possible.\nAnd in our Opinion section, the journalist Damon Beres writes that electronic \u201cdevices must be repairable by alland kept compatible with software updates for as long as possible.\u201d\nPeregrine falcons are basically avian Terminators.You can watch a live online video feedof a pair of these endangered birds in their nest on a bridge in New York.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "To Be Tracked or Not? Apple Is Now Giving Us the Choice.",
        "fulltext": "If we had a choice, would any of us want to betracked onlinefor the sake of seeing more relevant digital ads?\nWe are about to find out.\nOn Monday,Applereleased iOS 14.5, one of its most anticipated software updates for iPhones and iPads in years. It includes a new privacy tool, App Tracking Transparency, which could give us more control over how our data is shared.\nHere\u2019s how it works: When an app wants to follow our activities to share information with third parties such as advertisers, a window will show up on ourAppledevice to ask for our permission to do so. If we say no, the app must stop monitoring and sharing our data.\nA pop-up window may sound like a minor design tweak, but it has thrown the online advertising industry into upheaval. Most notably, Facebook has gone on the warpath. Last year, the social network created a website and took out full-page ads in newspapers denouncing Apple\u2019s privacy feature asharmful to small businesses.\nA big motivator, of course, was that the privacy setting could hurt Facebook\u2019s own business. If we choose not to let Facebook track us, it will be harder for the company to see what we are shopping for or doing inside other apps, which will make it more difficult for brands to target us with ads. (Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has disputed that his company\u2019s business will be hurt by Apple\u2019s policy.)\n\u201cThis is a huge step in the right direction, if only because it\u2019s making Facebook sweat,\u201d said Gennie Gebhart, a director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights nonprofit.\nBut, she added, \u201cone big question is: Will it work?\u201d\nMs. Gebhart and other privacy experts saidApple\u2019snew feature might not be enough to put an end to shady tracking on iPhones. It could simply push developers and ad-technology firms to find loopholes so they can continue tracking people in different ways, she and others said.\nFor about two months, I have been testing early versions of iOS 14.5 to get acclimated with the new privacy control and other new features. Only a few developers have been testing the pop-up window with the public, so my findings about how well the privacy feature works have been limited.\nBut I found that iOS 14.5 also has other important new features. One is the ability to use Siri to work with a music player other than Apple Music, such as Spotify, by default. That\u2019s a big deal: In the past, the voice assistant wasn\u2019t convenient to use with other music services.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Apple\u2019s new software.\nIt\u2019s important to understand how tracking works inside apps.\nLet\u2019s say you use a shopping app to browse for a blender. You look at a blender from Brand X, then close the app. Later, ads for that blender start showing up in other mobile apps, like Facebook and Instagram.\nHere\u2019s what happened: The shopping app hired an ad-tech company that embedded trackers inside the app. Those trackers looked at information on your device to pinpoint you. When you opened other apps working with the same ad-tech firm, those apps were able to identify you and serve you ads for Brand X\u2019s blender.\nApple\u2019s new privacy feature is intended to let you decide whether you want that to happen. Now, when you open some apps, you will be greeted with a pop-up window: \u201cAllow [App Name] to track your activity across other companies\u2019 apps and websites?\u201d You can choose \u201cAsk App Not to Track\u201d or \u201cAllow.\u201d\nWhen we select \u201cAsk App Not to Track,\u201d two things happen. The first is that Apple disables the app from using an Apple device identifier, a random string of letters and numbers that is assigned to our iPhones and is used to track our activities across apps and websites. The second is that we communicate to the app developer that, broadly speaking, we don\u2019t want our information to be tracked and shared with anyone in any way.\nThat seems easy enough. But No. 2 is where things also get slightly complicated.\nAd-tech companies already have many ways to follow us beyond Apple\u2019s device identifier. For example, advertisers can use a method calledfingerprinting. This involves looking at seemingly innocuous characteristics of your device \u2014 like the screen resolution, operating system version and model \u2014 and combining them to determine your identity and track you across different apps.\nIt\u2019s difficult for Apple to block all tracking and fingerprinting happening on iPhones, privacy researchers said. That would require knowing about or predicting every new tracking method that an ad-tech firm comes up with.\n\u201cFrom a technical standpoint, there isn\u2019t a whole lot that you can do\u201d to stop such tracking, said Mike Audi, the founder of Tiki, an app that can help you see what other apps are doing with your data.\nYet the privacy change is still significant because it explicitly asks us for consent. If we tell apps that we don\u2019t want to be tracked and they keep doing so, Apple can bar the offenders from its App Store.\nThe pop-up window also makes the privacy control far easier for people to discover, said Stephanie Nguyen, a research scientist who hasstudied user experience design and data privacy. In the past, iPhone owners could restrict advertisers from tracking them, but the tools to do so were buried in settings where most people wouldn\u2019t look.\n\u201cThe option was available before, but, really, was it?\u201d Ms. Nguyen said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big shift \u2014 making it visible.\u201d\nAs of this week, all apps with tracking behavior must include the App Tracking Transparency pop-up in their next software updates. That means we initially will probably see a small number of apps requesting permission to track us, with the number growing over time as more apps are updated.\nApple\u2019s new software also includes two other interesting new features: the ability to use Siri to play audio with a third-party app like Spotify and the option to quickly unlock an iPhone while wearing a mask.\nFor many, these will feel long overdue. Siri has seamlesslyworked only with Apple Music for music playback since 2015, which has been frustrating for those who want to use the voice assistant to play songs using other music apps. The change comes as antitrust scrutiny mounts over whether Apple stifles competition byfavoring its own apps.\nTo make Siri work with other audio services, you won\u2019t have to change any settings. If you normally listen to music with a third-party app, such as Spotify, Siri will simply learn over time that you prefer that app and react accordingly. (Audio app developers need to program their apps to support Siri, so if they haven\u2019t done so yet, this won\u2019t work.) That means if you always use Spotify to play music, you will be able to say \u201cHey, Siri, play the Beatles\u201d to start playing a Beatles playlist on Spotify.\nThe other new feature helps solve a pandemic issue. For more than a year, wearing a mask has been extra annoying for owners of newer iPhones that have face scanners to unlock the device. That\u2019s because the iPhone camera has not been able to recognize our covered mugs. Apple\u2019s iOS 14.5 finally delivers a mechanism to unlock the phone while masked, though it requires wearing an Apple Watch.\nHere\u2019s how that works: When you scan your face and the phone determines it can\u2019t recognize you because your mouth and nose are obstructed, it will check to see if your Apple Watch is unlocked and nearby. The Apple Watch, in effect, acts as proof to verify that you are the one trying to unlock your phone.\nTo make this work, update the software on your iPhone and Apple Watch, then open the Settings app on your iPhone. Scroll down to \u201cFace ID & Passcode.\u201d In this menu, go to \u201cUnlock with Apple Watch\u201d and toggle on the option to use your Apple Watch to unlock when the image scanner detects your face with a mask.\nNext time you are at the grocery store and look at your phone, your watch will vibrate once and unlock your phone. Sweet relief."

The rapid growth is partly explained by slower sales inthe same three-month period last yearas the pandemic first took hold, but the quarter was still strong on its own merits and far surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations. Apple\u2019s sales increased sharply in each of its product categories and in each of its regions around the world.\nAs usual, the main driver of Apple\u2019s success was the iPhone. Apple said iPhone sales rose by 66 percent to $47.9 billion, its steepest increase in years. The company\u2019s flagship product had accounted for more than half of its overall sales for years, but more recently Apple has tried to diversify into other businesses, causing the share of revenue from iPhones to fall to 41 percent in the quarter that ended September 30. Then Apple unveiled the iPhone 12 in October, and sales have surged. In the latest quarter, iPhones accounted for 54 percent of Apple\u2019s revenues.\nApple said that iPad sales grew 79 percent and that Mac sales grew 70 percent, success that was partly driven by more people splurging on computers as they worked and learned from home. Sales of Apple\u2019s wearable devices, including the Apple Watch and AirPods, grew 25 percent, and its services division, which includes app sales and subscriptions to iCloud and other Apple services, grew 26 percent.\nApple said on Wednesday that it would repurchase an additional $90 billion of its own stock, part of its continued program toreturn much of its earnings to shareholders.\nThe enormous profits are further evidence of the growing dominance of the biggest tech companies. Also announced this week:Microsoft\u2019s profitsrose 44 percent to $15.5 billion;Facebook\u2019s profitsnearly doubled to $9.5 billion; and profits atAlphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, more than doubled to nearly $18 billion. Amazon reports its earnings on Thursday.\nApple\u2019s continued growth comes amid increasing scrutiny of its power. The company is facing antitrust investigations from regulators around the world, and on Monday, Apple is set to face off ina trial against Epic Games, one of the world\u2019s largest game makers,over its control of the App Store.\nShares of Apple, which is worth roughly $2.25 trillion, rose nearly 2 percent in after-hours trading."

        "title": "Chuck Geschke, Father of Desktop Publishing, Dies at 81",
        "fulltext": "Chuck Geschke, a computer scientist and entrepreneur who helped develop fundamental ways of creating, sharing and printing digital documents in the early years of the personal computer, notably the now-ubiquitous PDF, died on Friday at his home in Los Altos, Calif. He was 81.\nHis wife, Nan, said the cause was cancer.\nIn 1980, at Xerox PARC, a research lab in Silicon Valley, Dr. Geschke and his fellow researcher John Warnock created a way of sending documents between a computer and a printer. Their bosses at Xerox said the company could get the technology to market in about seven years. Dr. Geschke (pronounced GESH-kee) and Dr. Warnock, believing they would miss a huge opportunity if they did not move faster, left Xerox and founded their own company, calling it Adobe.\nThey immediately started work on a new incarnation of their printing technology. The Apple co-founder Steve Jobs visited their tiny office in Mountain View, Calif., in 1983 and soon offered to buy this newborn start-up. Dr. Geschke and Dr. Warnock declined, but before the year was out, Apple had agreed to license their technology, called PostScript.\nA month later, Apple unveiled the Macintosh, which served as a template for the next four decades of computer desktops, laptops and smartphones. Its printer, the LaserWriter, unveiled the next year, was based on PostScript and built in partnership with Adobe. With Dr. Geschke as chief operating officer, Adobe became a key player in the rise of so-called desktop publishing.\nIn the past, anyone looking to print a flyer, newsletter, business report or catalog needed help from a professional print shop. Thanks to PostScript and other technologies, businesses or individuals could handle many of these job themselves.\n\u201cPostScript provided a language that allowed computer software to talk with a new class of lower-cost printers,\u201d said David C. Brock, a curator and director of the Software History Center at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. \u201cIt opened up a new space where people could print on their own.\u201d\nIn the years that followed, Adobe offered a wide range of other software tools for creating and printing documents, as well as digital graphics and other images. Many, such as Acrobat, Illustrator and Photoshop, became some of the most familiar names on the computer desktop.\nThe company\u2019s most influential creation was a version of PostScript for the internet age: the Portable Document Format, or PDF, which remains a vital way of sending and printing documents from almost any machine on the internet.\nDr. Geschke had a way of \u201clooking around the corner,\u201d said Shantanu Narayen, Adobe\u2019s current chief executive. \u201cCivilization is all about written material,\u201d he said. \u201cChuck and John brought that into the modern era.\u201d\nCharles Matthew Geschke was born in Cleveland, on Sept. 11, 1939. His mother, Sophia (Krisch) Geschke, worked for the Cleveland bankruptcy court as a paralegal. His father, Matthew, was a photoengraver, helping to prepare the plates needed to print newspapers and magazines.\nMatthew Geschke often told his son that there were two things he should avoid: the printing business and the stock market. For a time, Chuck Geschke followed his father\u2019s advice.\nRaised Roman Catholic, he attended a Jesuit high school in Cleveland and joined a Jesuit seminary after graduation. But he dropped out before the end of his fourth year. He often said that he and the Jesuits had come to the mutual decision that the priesthood was not for him.\nBuilding on the years he spent studying Latin in high school and at the seminary, he enrolled at Xavier University in Cincinnati and graduated with a degree in classics. Then he stayed on for a master\u2019s degree in mathematics, before working as a math professor at John Carroll University, a small Catholic university in Cleveland.\nHis life took another turn in the mid-1960s, when he told a struggling student to leave the university. The next year, the student returned, telling him, \u201cThe best thing you ever did was kick me out.\u201d The student had found a high-paying job selling computers for General Electric, and he soon taught his former professor how to write a computer program on the massive mainframe machines of the day.\nAmong the simple programs Chuck Geschke wrote that summer was a way of printing envelopes for the announcement of his daughter\u2019s birth. Not long after, he enrolled as a Ph.D. student in the new computer science department at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, one of the first in the country.\nHe received his doctorate in 1972 and joined Xerox PARC that same year. Five years later, as he was building a new research group dedicated to \u201cimaging sciences,\u201d he hired Dr. Warnock. The result was a new language that let computers create documents for printers.\nOthers at PARC had developed a personal computer called the Alto, whose graphical interface was well suited to the kind of digital printing that Dr. Geschke and Dr. Warnock envisioned. After Mr. Jobs visited PARC in 1979, the Alto helped inspire the Macintosh. It was only natural that he would approach the founders of Adobe.\nA year after the arrival of the Apple LaserWriter, Adobe went public. Despite his father\u2019s advice, Dr. Geschke had embraced both the printing business and the stock market. Today Adobe is one of the world\u2019s largest software companies, with a market value of $245 billion.\nBut the company\u2019s rapid rise did not come without personal hardship. In 1992, two men kidnapped Dr. Geschke at gunpoint in the parking lot at Adobe headquarters and held him in chains for four days at a rented house in Hollister, Calif. His family agreed to pay a ransom of $650,000, but after his daughter, Kathy, left the money at a designated drop point, F.B.I. agents captured the kidnappers and rescued Dr. Geschke.\nHe was Adobe\u2019s chief operating officer for another two years, remained president of the company until 2000, and served as co-chairman of the board until 2017. He also served on the boards of the San Francisco Symphony, the Commonwealth Club of California and the Nantucket Boys and Girls Club in Massachusetts, and was chairman of the University of San Francisco\u2019s board.\nPresident Barack Obama awarded him and Dr. Warnock the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2009.\nIn addition to his wife and daughter, Dr. Geschke is survived by two sons, Peter and John, and seven grandchildren.\nThough he helped build one of the world\u2019s richest companies, Dr. Geschke did not consider himself a businessman. He liked to say that he had never studied business and had read only one book on the subject.\nRather, he said, he saw himself as an engineer. \u201cEngineers dream of building something that millions of people will use; that\u2019s their ultimate goal,\u201d hesaid during an eventat the Computer History Museum in 2017. \u201cI don\u2019t think many engineers are motivated by money. They\u2019re motivated by having an impact.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIt\u2019s time to end the elaborate staged events that are essentially infomercials for new technology products.\nYou probably know the ones I\u2019m talking about. Steve Jobs or the currentAppleboss, Tim Cook,paces a dark stageand holds up ashiny slab of circuitsto an enthralled audience. Apple on Tuesday teased aplanned (virtual) eventnext week to do the stage-pacing thing for the latest iPads.\nMary Kay-style demonstrations for the 400th edition of an iPad are clearly not the most serious problem in technology or the world. Most people will never even watch these things, thank goodness. But they are an example of how we and tech companies don\u2019t stop enough and ask: Why does it have to be this way?\nApple\u2019s influence has spread these staged product launches \u2014 and they are mostly overhyped and unnecessary. Elon Musk does themfor Tesla carsandbrain implants. Media companies have borrowed this trick forhourslong presentationsfor theirplus-sign video streaming services. An infomercial about a website is really a step too far.\nThe Jobs-esque product demonstrations are also an unintentional signal of how tech companies see their customers. To them, we are blobs with wallets that can be persuaded by the Silicon Valley equivalents of a fast-talking guy on TV hawking a mop.\nMy biggest beef with these elaborate infomercials is that they\u2019re at odds with what technology is now. It\u2019s no longer confined to a shiny thing in a cardboard box. Technology now is thestuff that we don\u2019t necessarily notice\u2014 smarter software that alerts us to hazards while we drive or tech that gives small businesses the power of Amazon. It worms its way into our homes and lives, for better or worse.\nTechnology is also one of the most powerful forces in the world. And yet tech companies continue to hold product launches with the manic energy of an industry desperate to get noticed.\nWhat\u2019s the alternative? Well, Microsoft on Tuesdaypublished a blog postthat described the latest model of its Surface laptop and other products. Spotify also posted on its website aboutits new experimental gadget that\u2019s like a modernized car stereo remote.\nThe posts explained what the products were, and that was it. Maybe you\u2019ve heard the line, \u201cThismeeting should have been an email?\u201d Microsoft and Spotify showed that most product launches should be a blog post and a two-minute video.\nI\u2019m not the first person towritethat the staged tech product events that Applespread everywhereneed to go. Even I\u2019vewritten about it before.\nThis is old hat for Apple, too. And on Tuesday it did what it has done forever: Itreleased an intentionally vague messageabout what is expected to be a canned webcast presentation. This achieved its goal. People who care about technology talked about it.\nAnd of course, that\u2019s one reason these tech Tupperware parties endure: They get attention. (At least they do for Apple.) Journalists like me are a big part of the problem, too.\nBut we can just quit doing this. The Microsoft and Spotify products seemed to get noticed and written about on Tuesday even without a two-hour hype machine.\nThese product launches are a stale habit festering long after it\u2019s ceased being useful. It shows a lack of imagination from companies that are supposed to be imaginative and a disrespect for us, the customers. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.\nBitcoin is real now. Congrats/I\u2019m sorry:Coinbase, which lets people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is listing its stock publicly on Wednesday. My colleague Erin Griffith explained what Coinbase is, and why its stock listingis a validation for cryptocurrency believers. (I\u2019ll have a conversation with Erin about Coinbase in Thursday\u2019s newsletter.)\nIs Facebook doing more harm than good?The Guardian has been publishing a series of articles about the ways that Facebook is abused by world leaders in countries such asHonduras, Mongolia andAzerbaijanto mislead and manipulate their own citizens. It\u2019s a familiar tale of Facebook both giving citizens a voice and silencing them.\nPlanning vacations is going to be exhausting:My colleague Brian X. Chen has a special pandemic edition ofhow to use tech to prepare for a trip. You\u2019ll probably have to navigate the virus testing rules of your destination and digital documentation for vaccinations.\nLet\u2019s all look at some pretty fishon the Monterey Bay Aquarium kelp forest video feed.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "A Global Tipping Point for Reining In Tech Has Arrived",
        "fulltext": "China fined the internet giant Alibabaa record $2.8 billion this month for anticompetitive practices, orderedan overhaul of its sister financial companyand warned other technology firms to obey Beijing\u2019s rules.\nNow the European Commission plans to unveil far-reaching regulations to limit technologies powered by artificial intelligence.\nAnd in the United States, President Biden hasstacked his administration with trustbusterswho have taken aim atAmazon, Facebook and Google.\nAround the world, governments are moving simultaneously to limit the power of tech companies with an urgency and breadth that no single industry had experienced before. Their motivation varies. In the United States andEurope, it is concern that tech companies are stifling competition, spreading misinformation and eroding privacy; in Russia and elsewhere, it is to silence protest movements and tighten political control; in China, it is some of both.\nWhile nations and tech firms have jockeyed for primacy for years, the latest actions have pushed the industry to a tipping point that could reshape how the global internet works and change the flows of digital data.\nAustralia passed a law to force Google andFacebook to pay publishersfor news. Britain is creating its own tech regulator to police the industry. India adopted new powers over social media. Russia throttled Twitter\u2019s traffic. AndMyanmarand Cambodia put broad internet restrictions in place.\nChina, which had left its tech companies free to compete and consolidate, tightened restrictions on digital finance and sharpened an antimonopoly law late last year. This year, it began compelling internet firms like Alibaba, Tencent and ByteDance to publicly promise to follow its rules against monopolies.\n\u201cIt is unprecedented to see this kind of parallel struggle globally,\u201d said Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan and an antitrust expert. American trustbusting of steel, oil and railroad companies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was more confined, he said, as was the regulatory response to the 2008 financial crisis.\nNow, Mr. Crane said, \u201cthe same fundamental question is being asked globally: Are we comfortable with companies like Google having this much power?\u201d\nUnderlying all of the disputes is a common thread: power. The 10 largest tech firms, which have become gatekeepers in commerce, finance, entertainment and communications, now have a combined market capitalization of more than $10 trillion. In gross domestic product terms, that would rank them as the world\u2019s third-largest economy.\nYet while governments agree that tech clout has grown too expansive, there has been little coordination on solutions. Competing policies have led to geopolitical friction. Last month, the Biden administration said it couldput tariffs on countriesthat imposed new taxes on American tech companies.\nThe result is that the internet as it was originally conceived \u2014 a borderless digital space where ideas of all stripes contend freely \u2014 may not survive, researchers said. Even in parts of the world that do not censor their digital spaces, they said, a patchwork of rules would give people different access to content, privacy protections and freedoms online depending on where they logged on.\n\u201cThe idea of an open and interoperable internet is being exposed as incredibly fragile,\u201d said Quinn McKew, executive director of Article 19, a digital rights advocacy group.\nTech companies are fighting back. Amazon and Facebook have created their own entities to adjudicate conflicts over speech and to police their sites. In the United States and in the European Union, the companies havespent heavily on lobbying.\nSome of them, acknowledging their power, have indicated support for more regulations while also warning about the consequences of a splintered internet.\n\u201cThe decisions lawmakers make in the months and years ahead will have a profound impact on the internet, international alliances and the global economy,\u201d said Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of policy and communications.\nMr. Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, added that Facebook hoped \u201cthe techno-democracies in the U.S., Europe, India and elsewhere\u201d would \u201cwork together to preserve and enhance the democratic values at the heart of the open internet and prevent it from fragmenting further.\u201d\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s senior vice president of global affairs, also called for nations to coordinate. \u201cBalkanized, inconsistent regulations won\u2019t help and could actually make things worse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut done right, well-aligned rules can promote innovation, increase competitiveness and help consumers and small businesses.\u201d\nAmazon said it welcomed scrutiny, but \u201cthe presumption that success can only be the result of anticompetitive behavior is simply wrong.\u201d\nApple, Alibaba, its sister financial company Ant Group, and the Chinese gaming and social media giant Tencent, which owns the WeChat app, declined to comment.\nWhile a tech backlash has gathered momentum for years, it escalated in December. That was when regulators and lawmakers globally made a series of announcements on two main paths of attack against the industry: antitrust and content moderation.\nOn Dec. 9, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly every state filed bipartisan lawsuitsaccusing Facebook of acting anticompetitively. Less than a week later, European policymakers introduced a competition law and new requirements for blocking online hate speech. On Dec. 24, Chinese regulators opened anantitrust investigation into Alibabaafter scuppering an initial public offering from Ant.\nAntitrust and content moderation have been where tech companies are most vulnerable. Google, Facebook, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon and other companies clearly dominate online advertising, search, e-commerce and app marketplaces, and have faced questions about whether they have unduly used their clout to buy competitors, promote their own products ahead of others and block rivals.\nThe companies also face scrutiny about how hate speech and other noxious online material can spill into the offline world, leading to calls to better control content.\nThe antitrust push has especially sharpened in the United States, with landmark suits filed against Google and Facebook last year. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said they are drafting new antitrust, privacy and speech regulations targeting Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon. They have also proposedtrimming a law that shields siteslike YouTube, which Google owns, from lawsuits over content posted by their users.\n\u201cThis is a monopoly moment. Not just for the United States but for the entire world,\u201d the chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in a statement. \u201cCountries need to work together in order to take on the monopoly power held by the largest tech platforms and restore competition and innovation to the digital economy.\u201d\nMr. Biden has also picked tech critics for key administration roles.Tim Wu, a law professor who supports a breakup of Facebook, joined the White House last month, whileLina Khan, a law professor who has been influential on tech antitrust, was nominated to a seat on the Federal Trade Commission.\nIn Brussels, European Union officials are working on new laws to force Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to speedily remove toxic material and disclose more information about what they allow on their sites. A proposed antitrust law would also lower the threshold for intervention against platforms.\nEuropean officials are also taking aim at emerging technologies before they become mainstream. Draft regulations, to be released on Wednesday, will address the risks of artificial intelligence, potentially restricting how companies use the software to make decisions and influence people\u2019s behavior.\n\u201cAs the power of digital platforms has grown, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that we need something more to keep that power in check,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president overseeing digital policy, said in arecent speech.\nSome tech companies have issued legal threats and ultimatums against the new rules. But they have also bowed to government demands in several countries.\nAustralia offers a glimpse of that. Over the last year, thecountry dueled with Google and Facebookovera proposed lawthat would require them to pay news publishers for content shared on their platforms. To protest the legislation, Google threatened to make its search engine unavailable in Australia. In February,Facebook blockedthe sharing of news links completely.\nTim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web and a critic of tech power, said he opposed the Australian law because people would not be able to link freely on the web. He called that \u201cinconsistent with how the web has been able to operate over the past three decades.\u201d\nAustralia passed the law anyway. Facebook and Google are now paying some media companies for news.\nThe starkest turn against the tech companies has been in China. For years, Beijing blocked foreign websites and policed content on domestic platforms, but let homegrown tech firms like Alibaba and Tencent buy rivals, develop new products and expand.\nThat changed last year. In regulatory and legal proposals, Beijing telegraphed its desire to bring to heel an industry characterized bycutthroat competitionand huge influence over sensitive political issues like labor and data security.\nEven so, few were prepared for the whip-crack speed of Beijing\u2019s enforcement. In November, officialshalted Ant\u2019s initial public offeringdays before it was scheduled, then opened the antimonopoly investigation into Alibaba in December. The one-two punch was a shocking blow toJack Ma, Alibaba\u2019s founder and an entrepreneurial icon, who in October had riled state media after he likened state-run banks to pawnshops.\nBeijing ratcheted up pressure on Mr. Ma\u2019s companies this month with the $2.8 billion fine of Alibaba. On April 12, China also ordered Ant to undergo a \u201crectification plan\u201d to change the way it runs investment and credit products.\nThe next day, regulators summoned 34 of China\u2019s largest internet firms, including Tencent and ByteDance, the owner of the video site TikTok, and instructed them to \u201cgive full play to the cautionary example of the Alibaba case.\u201d The companies were given a month to conduct a self-inspection and publicly promise to curb anticompetitive behavior and follow Chinese laws on everything from data protection and taxes to speech.\nWithin a day, ByteDance had pledged to \u201cactively follow the guidance of law enforcement.\u201d Baidu, a search engine, vowed to \u201cresolutely curb false propaganda.\u201d\n\u201cChina\u2019s leaders take very seriously having a subservient, quiescent private sector,\u201d said Jude Blanchette, a China scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nEven before the meeting, at least one Chinese tech executive had gotten the message. On a call with analysts last month, Martin Lau, Tencent\u2019s president, struck a conciliatory tone toward the authorities.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to understand even more about what the government is concerned about,\u201d he said. Tencent, he added, will \u201cbe even more compliant.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s App Store Draws E.U. Antitrust Charge",
        "fulltext": "LONDON \u2014 European Union regulators on Friday accusedAppleof violating antitrust laws by imposing unfair rules and fees on rival music-streaming services that depend on theApp Storeto reach customers.\nAmid growingscrutiny of the tech industry worldwide,the case will be an important test of a government's ability to force one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most powerful companies to change its behavior. Europe is seen as a global bellwether on tech policy, but Apple has vowed to fight the charges.\nWith its ability to make or break the business of app developers, Apple is one of the digital economy\u2019s most important gatekeepers. Any app downloaded to an iPhone or iPad \u2014 from Tinder to Instagram to Candy Crush \u2014 must comply with the company\u2019s rules and guidelines, including using Apple\u2019s payment system and sharing up to 30 percent on any sales. If not, a company risks losing access to millions of Apple customers.\nApple says tight oversight of the App Store ensures customers download high-quality apps, protecting users from viruses, fraud and buggy software. But companies including Spotify, the music streaming service that filed a complaint two years ago that set off the European Union\u2019s investigation, have grown frustrated with its powerful position. They argue it allows Apple to undercut competitors to services like Apple Music and charge an unfair tax on developers.\nThe European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-nation bloc, agreed with Apple\u2019s opponents. Authorities zeroed in on requirements that rival music platforms use Apple\u2019s payment system, forcing them to give Apple a percentage of their subscription fees. The rules have the effect of driving up prices, regulators said, because companies are prevented from offering cheaper payment options and pass on Apple\u2019s fees to customers.\nMargrethe Vestager, the commission\u2019s executive vice president in charge of antitrust enforcement, said Apple was abusing its power to harm Spotify, which is Apple\u2019s main competitor in the music streaming and podcast market.\n\u201cBy setting strict rules on the App Store that disadvantage competing music streaming services, Apple deprives users of cheaper music streaming choices and distorts competition,\u201d Ms. Vestager said in astatement.\nMs. Vestager said that the findings were preliminary and that there was no fixed deadline for regulators to impose a penalty or reach a settlement. Earlier antitrust cases against Google took years to resolve. In the Apple case, remedies could include letting app developers use alternative payment methods.\nMs. Vestager said the commission had other investigations underway against Apple, including whether the company boxes out rivals toApple Pay, and had been speaking with counterparts in the United States, Australia and the Netherlands about the inquiries.\n\u201cIt is an area that has raised concern with a number of colleagues of ours around the world,\u201d Ms. Vestager said.\nSpotify cheered the European Commission\u2019s decision. Starting in 2016, the Swedish company stopped allowing customers to purchase a subscription through its iPhone and iPad apps as a way to avoid paying Apple\u2019s fee, instead steering people to Spotify\u2019s website.\n\u201cEnsuring the iOS platform operates fairly is an urgent task with far-reaching implications,\u201d Horacio Gutierrez, Spotify\u2019s head of global affairs and chief legal officer, said in a statement. The commission\u2019s announcement, he said, \u201cis a critical step toward holding Apple accountable for its anticompetitive behavior, ensuring meaningful choice for all consumers and a level playing field for app developers.\u201d\nApple said its App Store policies did not harm competition, but rather gave businesses a platform to reach customers. The company said developers could find payment alternatives, noting that Spotify pays little in commissions to Apple because customers must subscribe through a website. Apple said Spotify had become the world\u2019s largest music streaming service in part because of the App Store.\n\u201cThey want all the benefits of the App Store but don\u2019t think they should have to pay anything for that,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cThe commission\u2019s argument on Spotify\u2019s behalf is the opposite of fair competition.\u201d\nCriticism of the App Store is part of a broader debate overtech industry power, where a small number of companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, which owns Google, have government-like authority to set policies over major parts of the digital economy. This authority determines how people find information and entertainment, communicate and shop.\nThis week, Apple flexed its power by introducing a software update that gave customers more power to block data tracking by apps. The change has started afeud with Facebook, which has criticized the move as anticompetitive because it will harm the ability to sell online advertising.\nCompanies are increasingly pushing regulators and courts to intervene. At a hearing in Washington last week, companies including Spotify, Tile and Match Grouptold senatorshow policies set by Apple and Google, whose Play Store is another pinch point for app developers, hurt competition and resulted in higher app prices for customers. And next week, a trial is scheduled to begin in California between Apple and Epic Games, which makes Fortnite and has filedan antitrust lawsuit against Appleover its fees.\nBritain is conducting anotherantitrust investigationof Apple over the App Store after receiving complaints from developers.\nThe case announced on Friday is part of a broader effort by theEuropean Union to clamp downon so-called gatekeeper companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. Policymakers are drafting laws that would prevent the tech giants from abusing their market power to harm smaller companies, including how they manage app stores.\nEfforts to force App Store changes pose a threat to a fast-growing piece of Apple\u2019s business. As sales of iPhones, iPads and other hardware devices mature, the company is counting on digital services as a fresh source of growth. Optimism among investors about that business has helped send Apple\u2019s stock soaring, giving it a market value of more than $2.2 trillion, the largest in the world.\nPressure on Apple about the App Store has already led the company to make changes. Last fall,the company halved its commissionon many app sales to 15 percent for developers that made less than $1 million a year on their iPhone apps. That change affected about 98 percent of developers that paid the commission, but it still hardly touched Apple\u2019s bottom line; those developers accounted for less than 5 percent of the revenue Apple collected from apps, according to estimates by Sensor Tower, an app data firm.\nApple earns far more by taking a cut of sales from the most popular apps. Match Group, which makes the dating app Tinder, said recently that it paid Apple nearly $500 million a year in commission payments, its single largest expense.\nIf European regulators forced Apple to allow apps to use their own payment systems, enabling them to avoid Apple\u2019s commission, it could cost the iPhone maker billions of dollars a year. If a fine were levied instead, even in the billions of dollars, it would be a preferable outcome for Apple.\nApple has shown a willingness to fight with regulators. Last year, the company won an appeal to overturn an order to repay nearly$15 billion in unpaid taxesthat the European Commission said the company owed.\nA challenge for governments investigating the biggest technology companies is that the markets are complex and fast moving, said Tommaso Valletti, a former chief competition economist for the European Commission. Authorities must act quickly, he said, before competition is irreparably harmed.\n\u201cBecause of the usual fast dynamics in the digital economy, it is very difficult to restore the competition lost,\u201d said Mr. Valletti, now an economics professor at Imperial College Business School in London.\nJack Nicascontributed reporting."

        "title": "Breaking Point: How Mark Zuckerberg and Tim Cook Became Foes",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 At a confab for tech and media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho, in July 2019,Timothy D. CookofAppleandMark ZuckerbergofFacebooksat down to repair their fraying relationship.\nFor years, the chief executives had met annually at the conference, which was held by the investment bank Allen & Company, to catch up. But this time, Facebook was grappling with a data privacy scandal. Mr. Zuckerberg had been blasted by lawmakers, regulators and executives \u2014 including Mr. Cook \u2014 for letting the information of more than 50 millionFacebookusers be harvested by a voter-profiling firm,Cambridge Analytica, without their consent.\nAt the meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg asked Mr. Cook how he would handle the fallout from the controversy, people with knowledge of the conversation said. Mr. Cook responded acidly that Facebook should delete any information that it had collected about people outside of its core apps.\nMr. Zuckerberg was stunned, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook depends on data about its users to target them with online ads and to make money. By urging Facebook to stop gathering that information, Mr. Cook was in effect telling Mr. Zuckerberg that his business was untenable. He ignored Mr. Cook\u2019s advice.\nTwo years later, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Cook\u2019s opposing positions have exploded into an all-out war. On Monday, Applereleased a new privacy featurethat requires iPhone owners to explicitly choose whether to let apps like Facebook track them across other apps.\nOne of the secrets of digital advertising is that companies like Facebook follow people\u2019s online habits as they click on other programs, like Spotify and Amazon, on smartphones. That data helps advertisers pinpoint users\u2019 interests and better target finely tuned ads. Now, many people are expected to say no to that tracking, delivering a blow to online advertising \u2014 and Facebook\u2019s$70 billionbusiness.\nAt the center of the fight are the two C.E.O.s. Their differences have long been evident. Mr. Cook, 60, is a polished executive whorose through Apple\u2019s ranksby constructing efficient supply chains. Mr. Zuckerberg, 36, is a Harvard dropout who built a social-media empire with ananything-goes stance toward free speech.\nThose contrasts have widened with their deeply divergent visions for the digital future. Mr. Cook wants people to pay a premium \u2014 often to Apple \u2014 for a safer, more private version of the internet. It is a strategy that keeps Apple firmly in control. But Mr. Zuckerberg champions an \u201copen\u201d internet where services like Facebook are effectively free. In that scenario, advertisers foot the bill.\nThe relationship between the chief executives has become increasingly chilly, people familiar with the men said. While Mr. Zuckerberg once took walks and dined withSteve Jobs, Apple\u2019s late co-founder, he does not do so with Mr. Cook. Mr. Cook regularly met with Larry Page, Google\u2019s co-founder, but he and Mr. Zuckerberg see each other infrequently at events like the Allen & Company conference, these people said.\nThe executives have also jabbed at each other. In 2017, a Washington political firm funded by Facebook and other Apple rivals published anonymous articles criticizing Mr. Cook and created a false campaign to draft him as a presidential candidate, presumably to upend his relationship with former President Donald J. Trump. And when Mr. Cook was asked by MSNBC in 2018 how he would deal with Facebook\u2019s privacy issues if he was in Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s shoes, he replied, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d\nApple and Facebook declined to make Mr. Cook and Mr. Zuckerberg available for interviews and said the men have no personal animosity toward each other.\nRegarding the new privacy feature, Apple said, \u201cWe simply believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it\u2019s used.\u201d\nFacebook said Apple\u2019s feature was not about privacy and was instead about profit.\n\u201cFree, ad-supported services have been essential to the growth and vitality of the internet, but Apple is trying to rewrite the rules in a way that benefits them and holds back everyone else,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nMr. Cook and Mr. Zuckerberg first intersected more than a decade ago, when Mr. Cook wassecond in command at Appleand Facebook was a start-up.\nAt the time, Apple saw Facebook as a hedge against Google, the search giant that had expanded into mobile phone software with Android, a former Apple executive said. Around 2010,Eddy Cue, who leads Apple\u2019s digital services, sought out Mr. Zuckerberg for a potential software partnership, the former executive said.\nIn the ensuing meetings, Mr. Zuckerberg told Mr. Cue that Apple had to deliver a great deal for a partnership, or the social network would be happy to go it alone, this person said. Some Apple executives felt those interactions showed that Mr. Zuckerberg was arrogant, this person added.\nTwo other people said that the talks were cordial and that they were confused by the characterization of the meetings. The discussions eventually led to a software feature that let iPhone owners share their photos directly to Facebook.\nBut the friction had set the tone. The situation was complicated as Facebook and Apple also became mutually dependent. The iPhone was a key device for people to use Facebook\u2019s mobile app. And Facebook\u2019s apps \u2014 which later also included Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp \u2014 have been some of the most downloaded programs from Apple\u2019s App Store.\nBy 2014, Facebook executives had grown fearful of the leverage that Apple had over the distribution of its apps with iPhone customers. Those concerns were compounded when Apple at times delayed updates of Facebook's apps through its App Store, said people familiar with the matter.\nIn February 2014, when Facebook\u2019s board met to discuss Project Cobalt, which was a potential acquisition of an unidentified large social app, Apple\u2019s power was top of mind. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, argued for the deal partly to protect the social network from Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s control over smartphone software, according tothe meeting\u2019s minutes, which were released last year as part of a congressional investigation into tech companies.\nAdding another popular app to Facebook\u2019s offerings \u201cwould make it more difficult for operating system providers to exclude the company\u2019s mobile applications from mobile platforms,\u201d Ms. Sandberg said.\nMr. Cook, too, began thinking more negatively of Facebook, former Apple executives said. After the 2016 presidential election, federal authorities revealed thatRussians had misused Facebookto inflame American voters. In 2018, the Cambridge Analytica revelations broke, highlighting Facebook\u2019s collection of user data.\nMr. Cook decided to distance Apple from Facebook, the people said. While Mr. Cook had raised privacy as an issue as early as 2015, he ramped that up in 2018. Apple also unveiled a new corporate motto: \u201cPrivacy is a fundamental human right.\u201d\nThis was in line with Apple\u2019s marketing pitch, which was that people should buy $1,000 iPhones to help protect themselves from the internet\u2019s harms.\nWhen asked in an interview that year on MSNBC about Cambridge Analytica,Mr. Cook called the situation\u201cdire\u201d and suggested \u201csome well-crafted regulation is necessary\u201d for Facebook.\nThen, at its 2018 developer conference, Apple unveiled technology changes that struck at Facebook\u2019s ad business. Those included a built-in screen-time tracker for iPhones that let users set time limits on certain apps, which affected companies like Facebook that need people to spend time in apps to show them more ads.\nApple also said that to protect people\u2019s privacy, it would require companies to get permission from users of its Safari internet browser to track them across different websites. Facebook has used such \u201ccookie\u201d tracking technology to gather data, which enables it to charge advertisers more.\n\u201cIt really spoke to the power of Apple controlling the operating system,\u201d said Brian Wieser, president of business intelligence at GroupM, an advertising industry firm.\u201cFacebook isn\u2019t in control of its own destiny.\u201d\nAt Facebook, Apple\u2019s privacy moves were viewed as hypocritical, said three current and former Facebook employees. Apple has long had a lucrative arrangement withGoogleto plug Google\u2019s data-hungry search engine into Apple products, for instance. Facebook executives also noted that Apple was entrenched in China, where the government surveils its citizens.\nPrivately, Mr. Zuckerberg told his lieutenants that Facebook \u201cneeded to inflict pain\u201d upon Apple and Mr. Cook, said a person with knowledge of the discussions. The Wall Street Journalpreviously reportedMr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comment.\nBehind the scenes, that work had already begun. In 2017, Facebook had expanded its work withDefiners Public Affairs, a Washington firm that specialized in opposition research against its clients\u2019 political foes. Definers employees distributed research about Apple\u2019s compromises in China to reporters, and a website affiliated with Definers published articles criticizing Mr. Cook, according to documents and former Definers employees.\nDefiners also began an \u201castroturfing\u201d campaign to draft Mr. Cook as a 2020 presidential candidate, presumably to put him in President Trump\u2019s cross hairs, The New York Timesreported in 2018. A website, \u201cDraft Tim Cook 2020,\u201d featured a lofty quote from the chief executive and a model campaign platform for him. Data behind the website linked it to Definers.\n(Definers\u2019 work against Apple was also funded by Qualcomm, another Apple rival, according to a Definers employee. Facebook fired Definers after The Times reported on its activity.)\nApple and Facebook have also started competing in other areas, including messaging, mobile gaming and \u201cmixed-reality\u201d headsets, which are essentially eyeglasses that mix digital images into a person\u2019s view of the world.\nBy the 2019 Sun Valley meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s and Mr. Cook\u2019s relationship had reached a low. Then it got even worse.\nAt Apple\u2019s virtual developer conference last June, Katie Skinner, a manager on the privacy team, announced that the company planned a new iPhone feature to require apps to get users\u2019 consent to track them across different apps. She discussed it for just 20 seconds.\nTo Facebook, it was a declaration of war, three current and former employees said. If people were given the option to not be tracked, that could hurt Facebook\u2019s ad business, the executives figured.\nThe announcement came on top of a fight over gaming. Last year, Applerejected a Facebook Gaming app from its App Storeat least five times, until the social network had sufficiently tweaked the program.\nOver the next few months, Facebook and Apple sniped at each other over the new tracking transparency feature in letters to privacy organizations and advertising coalitions. Then in December,Facebooktook out full-page ads in The Times and other publications about the change. It declared Apple\u2019s privacy feature would hurt small businesses\u2019 ability to advertise and said it was \u201cstanding up to Apple.\u201d\nFacebook also met with advertising clients to warn them about Apple\u2019s change, according to a copy of a December video presentation that was viewed by The Times.\n\u201cApple made unilateral decisions without consulting the industry about a policy that will have far-reaching harm on businesses of all sizes,\u201d a Facebook product director said in the presentation. \u201cThe impact of Apple\u2019s changes makes it harder to grow. And for some, even survive.\u201d\nApple delayed the feature so apps and advertisers could prepare, but Mr. Cook refused to change how it worked. And in a picture to show the new feature, Apple used an image of a familiar app: Facebook.\nMr. Zuckerberg has since shifted his tune about Apple\u2019s move. With Wall Street nervous about the effect on Facebook\u2019s business, he said ina March interviewon the audio chat app Clubhouse that Apple\u2019s feature could benefit the social network. If advertisers struggled to find customers across different apps, he said, they might gravitate more toward Facebook because of its already enormous troves of data.\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible that we may even be in a stronger position,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Zuckerberg has also been blunt about Facebook\u2019s feelings on Apple. \u201cWe increasingly see Apple as one of our biggest competitors,\u201d he said in anearnings callthis year.\nEven on that point, Mr. Cook has disagreed.\n\u201cI\u2019m not focused on Facebook,\u201d he toldThe Timesthis month. \u201cI think that we compete in some things. But no, if I\u2019m asked who our biggest competitors are, they would not be listed.\u201d"
