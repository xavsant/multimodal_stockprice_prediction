        "title": "Google C.E.O. Says Tech Giant Has Improved the Web for All Consumers",
        "fulltext": "As Google\u2019s chief executive,Sundar Pichai, tells it, his company has always been on the side of consumers. It has paid billions to other industry giants, like Apple and Samsung, he said, to make sure Google\u2019s internet search engine worked as well as it should on those companies\u2019 devices.\nTestifying on Monday in Google\u2019s landmark antitrust trial, Mr. Pichai directly contradicted the Justice Department\u2019s claims that his company\u2019s huge payments to companies like Apple to be the default internet search option on their popular devices represented its unchecked monopoly power. Mr. Pichai said he had been worried that Apple, in particular, would make it more difficult to use Google\u2019s search on its devices, and he believed Google had to pay to make sure that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\u201cGiven that Apple designs the experience, it wasn\u2019t clear how they would change the experience if the financial incentive wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Mr. Pichai said while testifying for more than three hours.\nThe Google chief was the highest-profile witness to testify so far in the 10-week trial. The monopoly trial \u2014 the first involving a tech giant of the modern internet era \u2014 reflects increasing efforts in Washington to rein in the power of Big Tech.\nThe Federal Trade Commission has filed its own antitrust lawsuit against Meta, arguing it stifled nascent competitors, and Amazon, saying it squeezes small merchants and favors its own services. On Monday,President Biden signed an executive orderlaying out the government\u2019s first rules for the artificial intelligence systems that Silicon Valley companies have raced to build.\nMr. Pichai opted to stand at a lectern to deliver his testimony because of a sprained lower back, as he tried to undercut claims by the Justice Department and state attorneys general that Google stifled competition through default-distribution deals with companies like Apple and Samsung.\nGoogle paid $26.3 billion for its search engine to be the default selection on mobile and desktop browsers in 2021, according to Google\u2019s internal data presented during the trial. Most of that, about $18 billion, went to Apple, The New York Times hasreported.\nGoogle\u2019s competitors testified in the trial that the payments had effectively made it impossible for them to compete. Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, said the search giant\u2019s power was so significant that the internet was really the \u201cGoogle web\u201d and that its relationship with Apple was \u201coligopolistic.\u201d\nMr. Pichai, who is also chief executive of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, told a different story. He joined Google in 2004 and led the development of its Chrome web browser, which debuted in 2008. In 2014, he began leading product and engineering for many of the company\u2019s core products, including Search, Maps, Play and Android. The next year, he was named chief executive.\nFor 45 minutes, Google\u2019s lead litigator in the trial, John Schmidtlein, guided Mr. Pichai through questions about his almost two decades at the company, which has intersected with many of the products and deals at the heart of the case.\nMr. Pichai said that during negotiations with Apple to be the default search engine on its devices, an Apple executive, Eddy Cue, had told him that the deal was \u201cvery competitive.\u201d He said Mr. Cue had acknowledged there was \u201ctension\u201d between the two companies because Apple\u2019s revenue share from the deal, which was proportional to the traffic it sends to Google, had fallen.\nMr. Pichai said he had been worried that if Google did not improve the financial terms of the deal, Apple would degrade the experience of using its search engine.\n\u201cThere was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen if the deal didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pichai discussed how products that had Google as the default search engine, including the popular Chrome browser and the Android smartphone operating system, had boosted competition across the industry.\nWhen Chrome was released in 2008, Mr. Pichai said, it challenged the \u201cstagnant\u201d incumbent, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer, and provided users with a better experience on the web. Internet Explorer offered product updates annually or once every two years, he said, while Chrome released new versions every six weeks.\nMr. Pichai argued that Android\u2019s direct competition with Apple had improved all smartphones, leading to better screens and interfaces as well as increased usage in applications and Google\u2019s search engine.\nHis comments appeared to be aimed at addressing the legal standard that both sides say applies to the case. If the government can prove that Google\u2019s conduct has resulted in diminishing competition, Google must defend itself by showing its behavior was justified because of ways that it bolsters competition.\nDuring a cross-examination, Meagan Bellshaw, a lawyer for the Justice Department, tried to get Mr. Pichai to explain how much Google\u2019s default agreements had contributed to the search engine\u2019s popularity.\nMs. Bellshaw pointed to notes from an internal Google meeting, which said default agreements were responsible for 75 percent of the company\u2019s search traffic. Mr. Pichai said he could not comment on the figure because did not have full context for it.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s lawyer also homed in on a meeting in 2018 between Mr. Pichai and Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, to discuss Apple\u2019s concerns about how the search default agreement was playing out. Mr. Cook was worried that Apple\u2019s Safari revenue was growing more slowly than that of Google\u2019s search engine.\nPainting a picture of a cozy relationship between the two tech giants, Ms. Bellshaw read from an email recapping the meeting, in which a Google executive wrote that Mr. Pichai had said the companies\u2019 \u201cincentives are aligned.\u201d Mr. Pichai said in court that the meeting had tense moments, focused primarily on the search deal, and that the two companies fiercely competed in other arenas.\nWilliam Cavanaugh, a lawyer representing the state attorneys general, pressed Mr. Pichai on Google\u2019s rationale for sharing so much money with Apple, and whether he was paying the company to stay out of the search business.\nMr. Pichai repeatedly said he had renewed the deal because it was working well, leading to an increase in search usage and revenue, and had brought benefits to Apple, Google and its shareholders.\nFor a moment, the usually genteel Mr. Pichai appeared to have lost his patience during an exchange with Mr. Cavanaugh.\n\u201cI just gave all the reasons!\u201d Mr. Pichai said, before repeating himself."

        "title": "Inside Google\u2019s Plan to Stop Apple From Getting Serious About Search",
        "fulltext": "For years, Google watched with increasing concern as Apple improved its search technology, not knowing whether its longtime partner and sometimes competitor would eventually build its own search engine.\nThose fears ratcheted up in 2021, when Google paid Apple around $18 billion to keep Google\u2019s search engine the default selection on iPhones, according to two people with knowledge of the partnership, who were not authorized to discuss it publicly. The same year, Apple\u2019s iPhone search tool, Spotlight, began showing users richer web results like those they could have found on Google.\nGoogle quietly planned to put a lid on Apple\u2019s search ambitions. The company looked for ways to undercut Spotlight by producing its own version for iPhones and to persuade more iPhone users to use Google\u2019s Chrome web browser instead of Apple\u2019s Safari browser, according to internal Google documents reviewed by The New York Times. At the same time, Google studied how to pry open Apple\u2019s control of the iPhone by leveraging anew European lawintended to help small companies compete with Big Tech.\nGoogle\u2019s anti-Apple plan illustrated the importance that its executives placed on maintaining dominance in the search business. It also provides insight into the company\u2019s complex relationship with Apple, a competitor in consumer gadgets and software that has been an instrumental partner in Google\u2019s mobile ads business for more than a decade.\nThe relationship has come under scrutiny in thelandmark antitrust suitbrought against Google by the Justice Department and dozens of states. Lawyers for the government have argued thatGoogle rigged the marketin its favor with default agreements signed with companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla. These pacts funnel traffic to Google\u2019s search engine when users look up information in the top bar of a browser.\nGoogle is expected to begin a three-week presentation of its defense in the lawsuit\u2019s monthslong trial on Thursday. So far, the company has downplayed the role that its default agreements with phone makers and browser companies has had on its success. It argues that its search engine is popular because of itsquality and innovation, and that users can easily choose another default in their device settings.\nBut the documents viewed by The Times showed that Google understood the power of defaults in channeling users to a product as it tried to change Apple\u2019s selection of Safari as the iPhone\u2019s default web browser.\n\u201cCompetition in the tech industry is fierce, and we compete against Apple on many fronts,\u201d said Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman. \u201cThere are more ways than ever to search for information today, which is why our engineers make thousands of improvements a year to Search to ensure we deliver the most helpful results.\u201d\nWhile Google bids on default settings because they matter, he added, users can and do change their defaults. Apple declined to comment.\nLast fall, Google executives met to discuss how to reduce the company\u2019s reliance on Apple\u2019s Safari browser and how best to use a new law in Europe to undermine the iPhone maker, documents showed. While Google considered several options, including how much data it should have access to on the iPhone, it is unclear what the executives decided on.\nAt the time, the European Union was readying the Digital Markets Act, which was designed to help smaller companies crack Big Tech\u2019s control of the industry. Google, already one of the world\u2019s largest internet businesses, saw an opening.\nUnder the act, the European Union is forcing large tech companies designated as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d toopen their platforms to competitorsby March, giving users a choice of which service to use, and to stop favoring their own services on their platforms.\nThe law is expected to force Apple to allow customers in the European Union to download rival app stores. Users setting up a new Apple device in Europe could also be presented with an option to select a default browser other than Safari.\nGoogle, which the law will force to allow more competition in search, explored ways to lobby E.U. regulators to crack open Apple\u2019s tightly controlled software ecosystem so Google could siphon users from Safari and Spotlight, the documents showed. Executives debated how aggressive the company should be in advocating for access to Apple\u2019s operating system.\nGoogle executives figured that if users had to make a choice, the number of European iPhone users who selected Chrome could triple, according to documents reviewed by The Times. That would mean the company could keep more search ad revenue and pay less of it to Apple.\nRegulations intended to help smaller companies enter the marketplace \u201cvery frequently can also be used by incumbents to gain advantage over their rivals,\u201d Gus Hurwitz, a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School who focuses on technology and competition, said in an interview.\nGoogle and Apple have had a search engine partnership for Safari since 2002, half a decade before the iPhone\u2019s debut. The relationship became more complicated when Google released the Android mobile operating system in 2008, a direct competitor to the iPhone.\nGoogle was concerned about Apple\u2019s Spotlight from the feature\u2019s earliest days. In 2014, an internal presentation discussed the impact that Apple\u2019s new operating system, iOS 8, could have on Google\u2019s revenue. The second page of the slide deck was titled \u201cBottom Line: It\u2019s bad,\u201d according to apresentationintroduced as evidence in the antitrust trial.\n\u201cWe expect these suggestions to siphon queries away from Google in verticals where Spotlight is triggered,\u201d the company wrote.\nApplepoacheda powerful Google search executive, John Giannandrea, in 2018, and expanded its teams of search employees as it built a more capable Spotlight system. The 2021 improvements to the tool, as part of iOS 15, sparked concerns at Google over Apple\u2019s intentions in the search market, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.\nIn response, Google spun up an effort to build its own version of Spotlight, which was meant to work on iPhones, documents showed. It presented users with quick facts and information from files, messages and apps on the device.\nIn recent years, Apple has not used Spotlight to crib so-called commercial queries \u2014 which feature ads in their results \u2014 from Google, so the tool has not hurt Google\u2019s search business.\nStill, Google executives last year contemplated ways to convince the European Union to designate Spotlight as a search engine, according to the documents. Spotlight contained at least five different search features, offering web images; answers and \u201crich\u201d results that provided extra information like photos; and universal search, which could scan devices, apps and the web. The European Union has not yet decided whether to open Spotlight to greater competition under the law.\nThat Google is leaning on laws intended to help small companies has frustrated some legal experts.\n\u201cI prefer companies to compete on the merits for consumers to want to use their products by offering higher-quality products,\u201d Mr. Hurwitz said. \u201cNot by paying lawyers to go to the European Union and get rules in place in order to obtain access to their competitors\u2019 platforms.\u201d\nAdam Satarianocontributed reporting from London."

        "fulltext": "The box office results for Martin Scorsese\u2019s new film, \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d will be revealed on Sunday and analyzed by reporters and industry insiders. Did the movie perform well? Did it fall short? Did Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s inability to promote the film because of the actors\u2019 strike ultimately mean fewer people went to see it?\nThis is a normal opening weekend practice for any major theatrical release, but it will be a first for Apple Studios, the producer and financier of the $200 million movie. It is teaming up with Paramount Pictures to release the three-and-a-half-hour R-rated film in more than 3,600 theaters.\nUntil now, Apple\u2019s films were streaming-first. But \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d won\u2019t reach its streaming service, Apple TV+, for at least 45 days. It is Apple\u2019s clearest embrace of movie theaters since the start of Apple TV+ four years ago, and the first of three major theatrical releases from the company scheduled for the next six months.\nDuring Thanksgiving weekend, Sony Pictures will work with Apple to release Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon,\u201d starring Joaquin Phoenix. In February, Apple is joining forces with Universal Pictures to release the spy caper \u201cArgylle\u201d in theaters around the country.\nBradley Thomas, a producer of \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d called Apple\u2019s partnerships \u201ccomforting,\u201d because traditional studios have decades of experience with theatrical releases.\n\u201cSo Apple is dipping its toe into it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey aren\u2019t taking the whole thing on by themselves.\u201d\nThe producer Kevin Walsh, who began developing \u201cNapoleon\u201d with Apple in 2020, has watched its approach to theatrical release evolve. The turning point, he said, came after the top Apple TV+ executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amberg saw the success that Paramount had with \u201cTop Gun,\u201d which brought in $1.5 billion at the global box office last year.\n\u201cWhat \u2018Top Gun\u2019 did to the box office they are trying to emulate with movies like \u2018Napoleon,\u2019 and \u2018Formula 1,\u2019\u201d Mr. Walsh said in an interview, referring to the upcoming Brad Pitt movie that Apple is making with the \u201cTop Gun\u201d director Joseph Kosinski. \u201cI think there is money to be made, of course, for spectacle movies in the theater. But they also serve as a massive billboard for the Apple TV service when they are successful and rolled out well.\u201d\nApple\u2019s recent embrace of movie theaters is welcome news for a movie theater business that has been upended by streaming companies\u2019 penchant for making films largely for their at-home services. Netflix first disrupted the long-held tradition of the theatrical release by putting films in a limited number of theaters for a limited time \u2014 usually the minimum required to appease filmmakers and qualify for Oscar consideration.\nAmazon Studios recentlyreversed its approach, giving commercial films like Ben Affleck\u2019s \u201cAir\u201d significant time in theaters before releasing them to streaming subscribers.\nBut Apple, with its deep pockets, reputation for secrecy (it doesn\u2019t share streaming subscriber numbers and declined to comment for this article) and interest in controlling all components of its ecosystem, has surprised some with its willingness to team up with others to market its films to moviegoers. It\u2019s a situation that leaves the company open to the vagaries of the theatrical marketplace.\nAnd \u201cKillers,\u201d with its high price tag, has to do big business to become a success. Analysts are predicting that the film could fetch anywhere from $18 million to $30 million in its opening weekend. That would be a tough beginning even for a film by Mr. Scorsese, whose movies traditionally have staying power in theaters and often eventually gross close to five times what they brought in on opening weekend. The film\u2019s long run time and dark subject matter \u2014 the plot revolves around the murders of Native Americans \u2014 could also be commercial hurdles.\n\u201cWe are a little more bullish than the industry expectations floating around,\u201d said Shawn Robbins, an independent box office analyst, who predicts the film will open in the $30 million range. \u201cThe film certainly has its hills to climb with a long run time and DiCaprio\u2019s absence from the press circuit.\u201d\nBut \u201cstrong reviews and Mr. DiCaprio\u2019s own box office history \u2014 especially with Mr. Scorsese \u2014 provide ample amounts of good will for audiences,\u201d he added, and work in the film\u2019s favor. \u201cThe market hasn\u2019t had a high-profile film targeted toward adults for a while.\u201d (\u201cOppenheimer,\u201d with a similar run time and equally serious subject matter, defied odds this year and earned $942 million worldwide.)\nWhile Apple has said very little about its shift in strategy, theater owners are ecstatic.\nApple is \u201ca major company that has the ability to do a lot of high-quality work, and I think that the recognition on their part that movies belong in theaters is a strong signal,\u201d Michael O\u2019Leary, chairman of the National Association of Theater Owners, a trade association, said in an interview. \u201cPrioritizing theatrical will help them get major filmmakers to come into their tents, and to create even more dynamic, entertaining fare in the years ahead.\u201d\nMr. Scorsese and his co-writer, Eric Roth, began adapting David Grann\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2017. Paramount agreed to finance and distribute the film, but when the production costs soared, the studio brought in Apple in 2020 to finance the project.\nOthers wanted it, said Mr. Thomas, who initially purchased the adaptation rights to \u201cKillers\u201d with his partner, Dan Friedkin. It was Apple, however, that guaranteed a full theatrical release \u2014 a must for Mr. Scorsese, whose last film, \u201cThe Irishman\u201d for Netflix, had a truncated run in theaters.\nParamount stayed on in a deal that saw Apple reimburse the studio for its development costs on the movie and a portion of Mr. Scorsese\u2019s overall deal, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details were not public. Paramount controls all theater bookings and media buys for the film\u2019s trailers and commercials, while Apple controls its publicity and marketing materials.\nApple made similar, though less expensive, deals with Sony Pictures for \u201cNapoleon\u201d and Universal Pictures for \u201cArgyle,\u201d with Sony and Universal sharing the marketing costs with Apple and handling each film\u2019s distribution.\nAnd while all three studios would like the opportunity to enter into long-term partnerships with Apple, the tech giant has not committed to any one partner.\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if they take a single-studio approach for distribution,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, chief executive of Creative Strategies, a high-tech research firm based in Silicon Valley. \u201cApple is willing to work, and they have shown that they can work well, with multiple studios. I think that track is more likely to be what they\u2019ll use in the future. They are extremely calculating.\u201d"

        "title": "Spotify Gave Subscribers Music and Podcasts. Next: Audiobooks.",
        "fulltext": "Four years ago, Spotify\u2019s business was stagnating.Apple had overtaken itas the top paid music service in the United States,losses were mountingand customer growth was slowing.\nDaniel Ek, the company\u2019s chief executive, decided that Spotify needed to transform from a music service into the everything store for audio. The first missing piece was podcasts, a business that has helped boost ad sales.\nNow Mr. Ek has set his sights on anotherrapidly growing medium: audiobooks.\nOn Tuesday, Spotify said that it would begin offering 15 hours of audiobooks each month as part of its streaming service for premium subscribers in Britain and Australia. This winter, it will expand the offering to subscribers in the United States.\nSpotify\u2019s expansion into books has the potential to shake up the retail landscape for audiobooks, a fast-growing segment of publishing that has long been dominated by theAmazon-owned audio retailer Audible.\nIn Mr. Ek\u2019s eyes, Audible\u2019s audiobook dominance is reminiscent of Apple\u2019s past control over music and podcasts. Spotify built its business by disrupting the music industry with its monthly subscription service and podcasts. Mr. Ek said in an interview that he saw the potential to do the same with audiobooks.\n\u201cSimilar to music, one of the big problems is: How do you lower the friction?\u201d Mr. Ek said of audiobooks. \u201cHow do you enable consumers to discover amazing new audiobooks in an easy way?\u201d\nHaving books on Spotify, which has 220 million premium paying members worldwide, could help publishers reach a vast new audience. Spotify has the tools to recommend relevant audiobooks to podcast listeners who are interested in particular subjects, and to promote audio titles to Spotify users who have listened to a podcast featuring an author.\nSpotify will also make algorithmic recommendations to users and share some basic demographic information with publishers, said David Kaefer, the head of Spotify\u2019s audiobooks business.\nHachette Book Group, whose authors include David Sedaris, James Patterson and Donna Tartt, is putting more than 7,000 books on Spotify.\n\u201cI see this as a huge opportunity to be in the company of Joe Rogan, Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d said Ana Maria Allessi, the vice president and publisher of Hachette Audio.\nBut there\u2019s also concern that Spotify\u2019s plan, which involves experimentation with a new business model for book sales, could upend the lucrative and growing audiobook business. Rather than pay for each audiobook a customer begins listening to, the company has proposed paying for the amount of time that the customer listens, according to a review of a publisher\u2019s correspondence with agents, which described the terms.\nThe average audiobook lasts seven to 10 hours, Spotify said, which means subscribers can listen to about one and a half books per month, but some popular books can run for much longer. Subscribers can sample as many books as they want, and heavy users who want to listen to more can pay $10.99 for another 10 hours of audiobook content.\nKim Scott, the best-selling author of \u201cRadical Candor\u201d and a former executive at Google and Apple, is worried that Spotify\u2019s pay-as-you-listen model could devalue the work that goes into writing a book.\nThe proposal that Spotify has advanced is reminiscent of the way Apple changed the business model of music sales, Ms. Scott said. Rather than buying a full album for $10, iTunes users could buy individual songs for 99 cents.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a launch and iterate moment for the publishers; it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said Ms. Scott, who had declined when her publisher, St. Martin\u2019s Press, asked to include her book,\u201cJust Work,\u201din Spotify\u2019s streaming service. \u201cBefore I did this deal, I\u2019d hire a consultant and ask, \u2018Is this going to bring in new readers or cannibalize existing sales?\u2019\u201d\nSeveral publishing agents shared similar concerns but declined to speak on the record because of the sensitivity around ongoing negotiations. The agents worry that paying publishers for the amount of time that people listen to a book could eat into lucrative \u00e0 la carte payments and drive other retailers to pursue similar models.\n\u201cAudio has been a major driver of growth, so having a more diversified marketplace for audiobooks is a good thing,\u201d said Christy Fletcher, a co-head of the publishing division for United Talent Agency. But she added, \u201cWhile we all want to reach as many listeners as possible, there is a real risk that this consumption model devalues authors\u2019 work and becomes the norm for all platforms.\u201d\nThe new model promises to be less cumbersome than Spotify\u2019s initial foray into audiobooks last fall, whenit introduced purchases that required users to pay for each title and complete several stepsbefore they could listen.\nSpotify has struck deals with the five biggest publishers in the United States as well as hundreds of others, including smaller companies and self-published authors. It will offer a catalog of more than 150,000 titles to start. Its agreements with different publishing companies vary, and some publishers are being more cautious than others. Some big companies like HarperCollins and Penguin Random House have put their entire audio catalogs in, while another major publisher, Macmillan, is starting with just a fraction of its audiobooks.\nMr. Ek said he had heard the concerns from authors and publishers but believed that the 15-hour limit would protect the value of audio titles while drawing in new customers.\n\u201cThe economics are very favorable to the book industry,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone got on board because they see that ultimately, for heavy consumers, this is going to be a net positive.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Jon Stewart\u2019s show on Apple\u2019s streaming service is abruptly coming to an end, according to several people with knowledge of the decision, the result of creative differences between the tech giant and the former \u201cDaily Show\u201d host.\nMr. Stewart and Apple executives decided to part ways in recent days, two of the people said. Members of the show\u2019s staff were informed about its end on Thursday. Taping of episodes for the third season was scheduled to begin within a couple of weeks, one of the people said.\nThe Apple show, \u201cThe Problem With Jon Stewart,\u201d debuted to some fanfare two years ago as Mr. Stewart\u2019s return to the talk show format after a six-year hiatus. As host of \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d from 1999 to 2015, he turned a low-rated Comedy Central late-night series into a cultural force, becoming one of the nation\u2019s best-known media and political critics.\nBut Mr. Stewart and Apple executives had disagreements over some of the topics and guests on \u201cThe Problem,\u201d two of the people said. Mr. Stewart told members of his staff on Thursday that potential show topics related to China and artificial intelligence were causing concern among Apple executives, a person with knowledge of the meeting said. As the 2024 presidential campaign begins to heat up, there was potential for further creative disagreements, one of the people said.\nA representative for Apple declined to comment.\nApple\u2019s foray into entertainment has raised the risk of collateral damage to its brand or estrangement of the diverse customers who buy its pricey iPhones and iPads. As of September, Apple TV+ had more than 19.8 million U.S. subscribers, according to data from the analytics firm Antenna, excluding deals with some distributors.\nDelving into current events, as Mr. Stewart did on \u201cThe Problem,\u201d could have put Apple at the center of the kinds of political and geopolitical controversies that other major corporations have confronted, including the wayconservatives turned on Disneyorliberals protested Starbucks over gun safety concerns. Though Apple hadn\u2019t faced similar boycotts or criticism, the possibility was there with each episode \u2014 20 in all.\nIn its two seasons, \u201cThe Problem\u201d confronted several hot-button topics, including gun control and gender identity.\nThe show initially had difficulty gaining traction. By the second season, though, several interviews generated viral clips online, and the season was nominated for the outstanding talk series Emmy. (The prime-time Emmys ceremony is scheduled for Jan. 15.)\nNow \u201cThe Problem\u201d will join the many other talk shows that failed to survive in the streaming world, including ones hosted by Sarah Silverman, Norm Macdonald, Chelsea Handler and Joel McHale. Netflix, which made several attempts at a talk show, has moved on from the format.\nStreaming shows usually depend on a significant shelf life, whereas cable and network talk shows lean on the urgency of a topical news cycle.\nLiz Daycontributed reporting."

        "fulltext": "Apple Inc. sells a lot of smart watches during the holidays, but this year its sales of most Apple Watch models may well drop 100 percent \u2014 to literally zero \u2014 the day after Christmas.\nThat\u2019s because of arulingThursday by the International Trade Commission that most Apple Watches contain parts that infringe on patents held by Masimo Corp., a producer of medical technology, and its sister company, Cercacor Laboratories Inc., both of Irvine, Calif. An import ban and a cease-and-desist order on sales both take effect on Dec. 26 \u2014 unless President Biden reverses the decision by Dec. 25, which appears unlikely. (Presidentsrarelyoverrule theindependent, nonpartisan agency, which wasfoundedin 1916 as the U.S. Tariff Commission.)\nI\u2019ve been talking to people from Masimo for months about the I.T.C. case and other cases they have going against Apple. I didn\u2019t write anything because I wasn\u2019t sure how strong Masimo\u2019s arguments were. Now that it has scored this victory against Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable company, I think it\u2019s time to open the reporter\u2019s notebook.\nMasimo argues that Apple\u2019s reputation for innovation is undeserved and that the company has made a practice of \u201cefficient infringement\u201d \u2014 using other companies\u2019 technologies without permission and dealing with the legal fallout as necessary. The company points to something that Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder,saidin 1996: \u201cPicasso had a saying. He said, \u2018Good artists copy; great artists steal.\u2019 And we have, you know, always been shameless about stealing great ideas.\u201d\nApple, of course, rejects this characterization and says the company respects other companies\u2019 intellectual property. In Apple\u2019s defense, it\u2019s fair to assume that Jobs was speaking metaphorically, and not copping to a crime, when he said that the company stole.\nOn the other hand, Masimo has presented evidence that before launching Apple Watch models with competing technology, Apple hired the chief medical officer of Masimo and the chief technical officer of Cercacor, and then started looking \u201cnext level down.\u201d Apple opened offices near Masimo\u2019s and, according to Masimo, eventually hired more than 20 people from Masimo and Cercacor.\nLet\u2019s back up. Masimo, while not a household name, is a recognized world leader in patient-monitoring technologies for hospitals. It has possibly the best light-based pulse oximeter, which uses red and near-infrared light emitters and detectors to see how red, and thus how oxygen-rich, the blood in the arteries is.\nPartly thanks to software that efficiently extracts signal from noise, Masimo\u2019s pulse oximeter works even when patients are moving around or when they have a weak pulse. By using it on premature infants with underdeveloped lungs, hospitals can give them precisely the amount of oxygen they need \u2014 a good thing because too much oxygen causes blindness. It\u2019s also good for patients on heavy opioids, which can suppress the drive to breathe.\nIt\u2019s agreed by both sides that Apple sought a meeting with Masimo when it was exploring adding pulse oximetry to the Apple Watch. Apple signed a confidentiality agreement. A meeting was held in 2013. At this point, stories differ. Joe Kiani, the electrical engineer who founded Masimo in 1989 and remains its chief executive officer, told me on Friday that Apple decided that rather than pay for licenses to use the technology, do a joint venture, or buy Masimo, Cercacor or both, it decided to do \u201cstrategic hiring\u201d of key employees. Apple says it concluded that Masimo\u2019s technology wasn\u2019t suited for a consumer device, so it went in a different direction. (Although of course, it did hire those key Masimo employees.)\nApple finally introduced its first watch with pulse oximetry, the Series 6, in 2020. It has incorporated pulse oximetry into all of its smart watches since then, with the exception of the cheaper Apple Watch SE. That means Apple will have to stop selling all its watches except the SE model starting on Dec. 26 unless something happens before then: Either the companies cut a deal, the U.S. trade representative\u2019s office recommends to Biden that he reverse the ruling, or Apple persuades the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals to stay the injunction while it considers an appeal.\nThe I.T.C. case is only one front in the battle between Masimo and Apple. In 2020, Masimo sued Apple in Federal District Court in California, alleging theft of trade secrets. The suit ended in a mistrial in May when the jury deadlocked. The case is being retried. Last year, Apple sued Masimo in federal court in Delaware, charging that Masimo was the one doing the illegal copying and was trying to knock Apple out of the market to make way for its own watch. Masimo counter-claimed that Apple had infringed its patents, falsely advertised its watches\u2019 capabilities and violated antitrust and fair competition laws. In a separate action this September, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\u2019s invalidation of some of Masimo\u2019s patent claims, butrescued others.\nSo, a lot going on.\nKiani told me that his company has spent more than $60 million on its legal fights with Apple. He said he thinks the I.T.C. ruling in Masimo\u2019s favor will help the company in other jurisdictions, even though it\u2019s not binding for them, because the I.T.C. is a reputable agency that did a deep dive into the allegations. \u201cThe same patents Apple was found to have infringed at the I.T.C. are also at issue in Delaware District Court litigation,\u201d the company wrote me in an email.\nThe administrative law judge for the commission said she found no significant evidence that Apple\u2019s patent infringement was the result of copying. Masimo responded in its email to me that her ruling has no bearing on its claim of trade secrets theft in the California case, since trade secrets \u201care not disclosed in Masimo\u2019s patents at all.\u201d\nMasimo has been moving into consumer markets with products including the W1, a smart watch that competes with the Apple Watch. Neither company has yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to claim its product is suitable for medical use. Kiani argues that Apple\u2019s technology is inferior and has given pulse oximetry a bad name with customers.\nApple declined to provide an executive to speak on the record. The company\u2019s position is that Masimo is pursuing a strategy of litigation over innovation, hoping to generate a fresh stream of royalties because royalties from past litigation have dried up. Apple points out that the federal jury that deadlocked in May was 6-to-1 for Apple, indicating that Masimo was a long way from making its case.\nThis fight is far from over. \u201cMy goal isn\u2019t just to beat Apple,\u201d Kiani told me in an interview last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s to get Apple to change its ways.\u201d\nThe 4.9 percentannualized growthof U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter was \u201cas hot as it gets,\u201d David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Toronto-based Rosenberg Research, wrote to clients on Friday. Strong consumer spending was buoyed by pandemic savings, which are rapidly dissipating, and by credit cards, he wrote. Plus, the consumer spending data might be revised downward. He added: \u201cWe expect a sharp pullback in growth in Q4 and maintain our call that the U.S. economy is headed toward a recession in 2024.\u201d\n\u201cWall Street bilks Main Street. Since the introduction of money thousands of years ago, financial intermediaries with more information have been taking advantage of lenders and borrowers with less.\u201d\n\u2014 Frank Partnoy, \u201cF.I.A.S.C.O.: Blood in the Water on Wall Street,\u201d second edition (2009)"

        "title": "What the U.S. Has Argued in the Google Antitrust Trial",
        "fulltext": "Since Sept. 12., the Department of Justice and a group of state attorneys general have questioned more than 30 witnesses as theytry to prove that Google broke antitrust laws, ina landmark monopoly trialthat may affect the power of the technology industry.\nThe government is now wrapping up its side in the case \u2014 U.S. et al. v. Google \u2014 setting the stage for the internet giant to mount its defense starting this week.\nTwo prime threads have emerged from the government\u2019s case: what it said Google did to illegally maintain its search and search ads monopolies and how those practices harmed consumers and advertisers. We lay out the main arguments.\nOn the first day of the trial, the Justice Department said Google hadpaid Appleand other tech platforms more than $10 billion a year to make itself the default search engine on the iPhone and other devices.\nIt was perhaps the most important piece of evidence to support the government\u2019s central argument: that Google broke the law by using multibillion-dollar contracts to be the default search engine across the internet so it could maintain its monopoly. The eye-popping value of the deals had not been revealed before and helped the Justice Department set the tone for the trial.\nThe $10 billion figure has since loomed large. The Justice Department called several witnesses who said Google\u2019s rich default deals made it impossible to compete.Satya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, testified that he tried nearly every year to persuade Apple to switch its search default to Bing \u2014 and failed. DuckDuckGo said it was nearly impossible for consumers to discover its rival search engine because of Google\u2019s default agreements.\nThe Justice Department also displayed internal documents from Google in which employees mused on the power of those defaults to keep rivals at bay. The company has countered that anyone can easily switch the defaults on Safari and other browsers.\nThe Justice Department has also circled around the idea that Google\u2019s enormous scale distorts the competitive landscape, keeping even well-heeled rivals out of the search engine business \u2014 which only further empowers Google.\n\u201cThis feedback loop, this wheel, has been turning for more than 12 years,\u201d Kenneth Dintzer, the Justice Department\u2019s lead courtroom lawyer, said in his opening statement. \u201cAnd it always turns to Google\u2019s advantage.\u201d\nMicrosoft\u2019s Mr. Nadella, who was one of the government\u2019s star witnesses, called the internet the \u201cGoogle web\u201d and said even his big company had largely failed to make a dent in Google\u2019s search dominance.\nIn one striking moment, Judge Amit P. Mehta, who is presiding over the case, asked Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google executive who later founded a competing search engine called Neeva, why Google made payments to Apple and others.\n\u201cThe payments effectively make the ecosystem exceptionally resistant to change,\u201d Mr. Ramaswamy replied.\nGovernment lawyers said Google\u2019s dominance in search had led to a worse-quality product being delivered to consumers.\nIn one example, the government said that if Google had to compete more with other search engines, consumers might have access to services that were more respectful of their personal privacy. As it stands, Google monitors users to better target them with ads that fuel its bottom line, government lawyers said.\nTo underscore its point, thegovernment called Gabriel Weinberg, the chief executive of DuckDuckGo, to the witness stand. DuckDuckGo says it collects less information from users than Google does.\nMr. Weinberg said his company struggled to put its search engine in front of users because of Google\u2019s control over default search engines. DuckDuckGo had sought deals with companies like Apple and Mozilla, the maker of Firefox, to be the default search engine in the browsers\u2019 private modes, he testified. But the companies had contracts with Google that were \u201cthe key thing preventing us from getting a deal done with them,\u201d he said.\nGoogle has countered that it is constantly improving its search engine, adding features to improve the experience for consumers.\nGoogle\u2019s power in search has allowed it to obtain influence over the market for ads that run alongside the links that appear in response to a user\u2019s query, the government said.\nIn this 2017 internal Google document, an executive compares the search ads business to that of selling cigarettes or drugs. The executive testified at the trial that he produced the document during a communications training where he was practicing how to use hyperbole to get someone\u2019s attention.\nJoshua Lowcock, who was an executive at an ad buying firm when he testified, said from the witness stand that his firm had, during one period several years ago, calculated Google\u2019s share of search at over 88 percent and Bing\u2019s at just over 6 percent. That dominance made Google\u2019s search ads attractive to the firm\u2019s clients and limited the usefulness of Bing\u2019s ads, he said.\nThe government also called employees of major advertisers like Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase to attest to the importance of Google\u2019s search advertising services.\nArjan Dijk, a onetime Google executive who now runs marketing for the travel site Booking.com, said Google\u2019s search ads gave it access to an \u201cexclusive, dominant\u201d pool of potential customers.\nDuring testimony, the Justice Department hammered Google employees over whether they can inflate the prices for search ads because marketers have limited options if they want to spend their money elsewhere.\nIn one 2019 email shown in court, Jerry Dischler, a Google executive, wrote to a colleague that the company was at risk of missing its revenue targets. If it wanted to avoid spooking Wall Street, he wrote, the company should consider tweaking aspects of its products to drive more search queries and increase ad revenue.\nJeff Hurst, the former chief operating officer of Expedia, pointed to the experience of Vrbo, its vacation rental site, as evidence of Google\u2019s power to raise prices without delivering more value for advertisers.\nIn one 2019 email, a Google executive, Jerry Dischler, wrote to a colleague that the company was at risk of missing its revenue targets.\nIn 2015, Vrbo spent $21 million on Google search ads, generating about 500 million online visits to Vrbo, Mr. Hurst testified. By 2019, Vrbo was paying Google roughly $290 million for search advertising for about the same volume of traffic as four years earlier.\n\u201cWe spent a heck of a lot more with Google for no incremental benefit,\u201d Mr. Hurst said.\nIn the cross-examination of Mr. Hurst, a Google lawyer noted that both Expedia and Vrbo had grown and prospered since 2015, and Expedia had shifted its strategy to focus more on generating traffic directly from the mobile apps for its main businesses, Expedia, Vrbo and Hotels.com."

        "fulltext": "Foreign and local companies in China are increasingly the targets of tax audits and other regulatory reviews, as local governments try to steady their finances by collecting more revenue.\nThe latest company to come under scrutiny isFoxconnof Taiwan. Chinese state media outlets reported on Sunday that the company was facing investigations in four provinces.\nFoxconn, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of electronics, isApple\u2019s main contractorfor the production of everything from iPhones to MacBook laptop computers.\nGlobal Times, a nationalistic tabloid and website owned by the Communist Party of China, said that Foxconn faced tax inspections in Guangdong and Jiangsu Provinces and was being investigated in Henan and Hubei Provinces to determine whether it had complied with land use regulations.\nFoxconn, whose full name is Hon Hai Technology Group, issued a statement hours later that said the company would comply with its legal obligations: \u201cLegal compliance everywhere we operate around the world is a fundamental principle of Hon Hai Technology Group (Foxconn). We will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations.\u201d\nLast Thursday, Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, met in Beijing with Jin Zhuanglong, China\u2019s minister of industry and information technology. \u201cThe two sides exchanged views on Apple\u2019s development in China, industrial chain supply chain cooperation and other issues,\u201d the ministry said in a statement afterward.\nIn recent months, central government authorities have warned local and provincial governments facing budget shortfalls not to use arbitrary fines to raise money. Beijing is trying hard to woo foreign investment to strengthen economic growth and maintain China\u2019s leading role in global supply chains.\nAn article last Wednesday in Study Times, the official publication of the Communist Party\u2019s most elite training institute, the Central Party School, warned that inappropriate use of fees and intervention by local governments could lead to \u201cultimately disrupting the business order, damaging the business environment, and affecting the confidence of the business.\u201d\nDeep uncertainty in the real-estate markethas left many local governments facing financial hardship. Their biggest source of revenue, the sale of land leases to property developers, has dried up in all but the largest cities. The two developers that vied for national leadership over the past several years,China EvergrandeandCountry Garden, are in peril, unable to make punctual debt payments.\nLocal governments face soaring health care and pension costs for an aging population. The national government makes some financial transfers to these local governments, but has done little to assume direct responsibility for the cost of social benefits.\nAt the same time, Beijing has pressured local governments to step up their spending on the construction of rail lines, highways, bridges and other infrastructure, as part of an effort to reduce unemployment. Joblessness among Chinese in their late teens and early 20s reached record levels by early summer, prompting the National Bureau of Statistics to stop releasing youth unemployment data.\nSiyi Zhaocontributed research."

        "title": "Investing Has Been Ugly. Stick With It Anyway.",
        "fulltext": "This is one of those stretches when you may want to avoid looking at your investments.\nPerformance reports for the three months that ended in September are arriving now, and they are ugly. The vast majority of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 the vehicles used by most Americans for their investments \u2014fell. There were losses in most markets and in nearly all asset classes.\nIf you\u2019ve lost money, take somedeep breaths, practice yoga, watch a ballgame, enjoy time with family and friends \u2014 whatever works. But don\u2019t make abrupt changes in your investments. A good plan is better than an emotional response when markets fall.\nI say all that assuming you already have a solid investment portfolio set up \u2014 a simple one, ideally, containing cheap funds, preferably index funds that mirror the total market.\nIf you don\u2019t have a solid plan yet, a downturn is a great time to start. Most basically, stock and bond prices will be lower than they were just a short time earlier.\nBut invest for the long term. Hold diversified stock funds for higher returns and bond funds for income and stability (though bonds haven\u2019t been paragons of stability lately), and stick with them. Stash the money you need to pay the bills in money-market funds, short-term savings accounts and Treasury bills.\nKeep your costs low and hold broadly diversified investments for years to come. For most people, that\u2019s a much better bet than stock-picking and frequent trading, numerous studies show.\nThis approach requires the ability to withstand losses, though, and that ability is being tested now.\nThe average domestic stock fund in the Morningstar database declined 3.5 percent for the quarter. The average taxable bond fund fell 1.1 percent. The average municipal bond fund fell 3.3 percent. As a group, internationally oriented stock funds fared even worse. They declined 4.7 percent.\nFurthermore, core stock and bond indexes that function as benchmarks \u2014 and, in some cases, are the foundation \u2014 for many mutual funds and E.T.F.s. fell during the quarter.\nDividends included, the S&P 500 stock indexlost3.3 percent for the three months through September.\nThese numbers aren\u2019t shocking in themselves. What makes them painful, however, is that they come after the markets had begun recovering from thesteep declinesof last year.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising when the stock market falls. Such declines have made headlines for decades. But bonds are different. They have a reputation for steady, even stodgy performance. The latest returns undercut those assumptions.\nFor the last quarter, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (it was once the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index) lost 3.2 percent, including dividends, nearly as much as the S&P 500. What\u2019s worse, over three years, this core bond index lost nearly 15 percent, including interest paid out in dividends, while the S&P 500gainedabout 34 percent.\nThose returns understate the bond market carnage. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Index, which tracks long-term Treasuries, lost 13 percent for the quarter \u2014 and about 42 percent for the three years through September, including dividends.\nYou don\u2019t need to worry about individual, high-quality bonds if you hold them to maturity. But if you trade them while market interest rates rise, you can incur serious losses.\nA major shift in interest rates caused the pain in the bond market and hurt stocks, too.\nRecall that during the first stage of the pandemic, theFederal Reservedropped the short-term federal funds rate to nearly zero in a bid to support the ravaged economy. Then, afterinflationbecame red hot, it began raising short-term rates early last year in an effort to put out the inflation fire.It isn\u2019t done yet.\nLonger-term rates in the bond market didn\u2019t rise as much or as quickly at first \u2014 perhaps signaling an eventual recession \u2014 but longer-term bond rates have been shooting up lately.\nInterest rate increases have caused automatic declines in bond prices. That\u2019s a function of bond math. Yields and prices move in opposite directions, so rising interest rates have translated into falling bond prices, especially for securities of longer duration.\nFor stocks, the effects of rising rates are more complicated. For one thing, utilities and high dividend-paying stocks have been hit hard because their chief virtue \u2014 their ability to generate income \u2014 doesn\u2019t look nearly as attractive now that high-quality bonds offer reliable payouts of more than 5 percent annually. Beyond that, corporate costs have risen with higher interest rates, slightly impairing corporate earnings in the third quarter.\nGains in the S&P 500 earlier in the year were based largely on investor optimism about future earnings growth. A.I. fever gripped the market, elevating stocks likeNvidia, which supplies computer chips that enable artificial intelligence programs to operate. Nvidia was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 for the calendar year through September, with a total return of nearly 198 percent.\nBut the market\u2019s mood has become dour as theFed has signaledit intends to hold interest rates \u201chigher for longer.\u201d\nIn September, Nvidia shares flagged, however, with a decline for the month of 11.9 percent.\nThe stock market is top-heavy, depending disproportionately on a handful of big companies. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 accounted for nearly 70 percent of the index\u2019s price increase for the calender year through September, according to Bespoke Investment Group. These are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly and Visa.\nWhen some of these stocks faltered in the third quarter, they pulled the market down with them. Apple declined 11.7 percent during the quarter. Because it is weighted so heavily in the S&P 500, it was responsible for one-fourth of the entire index\u2019s decline, Birinyi Associates calculated.\nEnergy pricesrose in the quarter, and that\u2019s caused a variety of problems. Gasoline has been getting expensive again, and higher energy costs are rippling through the economy, complicating the Fed\u2019s battle against inflation, while weighing on the profits of companies that are net energy consumers.\nBut for some investors, there has been a bright side. Higher prices for energy are a boon for stocks and funds that focus on fossil fuel.\nCompare these stock returns for the quarter:\nExxon Mobil, the oil giant, up 9.6 percent.\nMarathon Petroleum, the nation\u2019s largest petroleum refiner, up 29.8 percent.\nSolar Edge, which calls itself \u201ca visionary leader in smart energy technology, committed to harnessing the power of the sun to create a sustainable future,\u201d lost 51.9 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the S&P 500.\nProfiting from higher fossil fuel prices is less than ideal if you are worried about climate change. Yet the economy still depends on fossil fuels. And even if alternative energy comes to dominate the future, oil and gas are generating riches now.\nEnergy stock funds focused mainly on fossil fuels rose 10.4 percent for the three months through September, according to Morningstar, and funds likeVanguard Energy IndexFund andFidelity Advisor Energy Fundgained more than 13 percent. Exxon was the biggest holding in these funds.\nEnergy \u2014 fossil fuel or alternative \u2014 has come in and out of favor, and prices have dropped in October. Where they head next is anybody\u2019s guess.\nMore broadly, where interest rates and inflation are going \u2014 and whether the economy will plunge into a recession \u2014 are crucial questions without reliable answers. I\u2019d be skeptical of anyone who claims to know.\nPredicting commodity, stock or bond prices is hazardous, at best. You can make big profits if you bet correctly, but you will be taking big risks.\nUnless you do this for a living, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Instead, for long-term investing, it\u2019s far more sensible for most people to seek absolutely average returns, without trying to pick favorites or time the movements of the markets.\nJust being average has been a solid strategy. SinceNovember 2000, despite numerous crises and downturns, a basic investment with 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds in broad U.S. market index funds returned nearly 300 percent.\nTo capture that return, you needed to have kept fees to a minimum, to have held diversified index funds and to have disregarded market dips like this one.\nThere will be further storms ahead, and big ones. Try to prepare for them, and prosper."
