        "title": "The Year in Apple Watches, A.I., Anarcho-Capitalists and Anticapitalists",
        "fulltext": "We covered a lot of ground together in 2023. In this issue of the newsletter I\u2019ll update you on some topics I wrote about this year. A lot of things didn\u2019t turn out quite as I\u2019d imagined. Some did.\nNobody reads this newsletter to get rich by learning what\u2019s about to happen in the economy and markets. For that, you\u2019d want to put your money withHindsight Capital, the unfortunatelynonexistenthedge fund invented by the journalist John Authers that gets every call right by investing in hindsight.\nStill, I did go out on a limb now and then, prognosticating on topics ranging from the risk of recession to the possibility of a strike at UPS to the question of whether Apple would yank its smart watches off the market. Here\u2019s a look at how a few calls turned out.\nIn January Iwrotethat the leftist president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, had \u201cno easy choices\u201d after thousands of supporters of his rightist opponentbroke into government buildingsin the capital, Bras\u00edlia, to protest what they falsely believed was a stolen election. It\u2019s been a better year for Lula than I expected.Inflationhas fallen, and hispollsare good. This month, Brazil\u2019s Congressbackedhis tax reform plan. But itdefiedhim by making it harder for Indigenous tribes to stop deforestation.\nIn February in a newsletter about regulation of artificial intelligence, Iwrotethat OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, deserved credit for acknowledging that the software could generate harmful outputs \u201cand what\u2019s more, trying to do something about it.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize then that the nonprofit\u2019s board was deeply divided over how quickly to roll out advances in A.I. \u2014 as the worlddiscoveredin November.\nIn March Iwrotethat the pause on student loan payments had become a political trap and that borrowers would react badly if the Supreme Court invalidated the Biden administration\u2019s plan to wipe out $400 billion of the debt. That turned out to be correct. The courtrejectedthe Biden plan, and about nine million of the 22 million borrowers who were supposed to resume payments in October hadn\u2019t paid anything by mid-November, the Education Departmentannounced. What I hadn\u2019t counted on was that the Biden administration would findnew waysto forgive student loans or ease repayments.\nI waspessimisticabout the banking system in May after the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. I wrote that Federal Reserve interest rate increases were tempting depositors to take their money out of banks and put it in higher-yielding money market deposits. There haven\u2019t been any big failures since that trio, but regional banks aren\u2019t in the clear yet. KeyCorp, Citizens Financial, Truist Financial and PNC Financial announced this fall that they were shrinking to cut costs, The Wall Street Journalreported.\n\u201cWhen all hope is lost, hire a woman to take over (and take blame),\u201d Iwrotein June, referring to the hiring of Hafize Gaye Erkan, a former Wall Street banker, as the new central bank governor of Turkey. Some observers were saying that Turkey was headed for a financial crisis. (Studieshave found that companies tend to bring women on as leaders when business is struggling.) Luckily for her, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, has backed away from the crank notion that cutting interest rates will cure inflation. He allowed Erkan to raise the central bank\u2019s key interest rate to 40 percent in November, from 8.5 percent when she took office. Inflation is stillhigh, though. Erkan has moved her family in with her parents tosave money.\nIn July Iwrotethat Toyota had a point when it pushed hybrids over all-electric vehicles. Toyota argued that E.V.s use a huge amount of battery materials such as lithium. It said one can reduce greenhouse gases more by using a pile of those raw materials to make 90 hybrids instead of one E.V. But readers reminded me that there\u2019s no need to economize on lithium use \u2014 at least notyet. This fall I leased an E.V., so what do I know?\nAlso in July, Iwrotethat California and Florida were struggling with an exodus of property insurers. I was told at the time that California\u2019s insurance commissioner, Ricardo Lara, had not decided if he was in favor of two big changes in rate setting: taking reinsurance costs into account and looking forward, not just backward, to assess risks. In September, Lara pleased insurers by including both of those changes in areform package. Florida had a light hurricane season this year (except forIdalia). Florida officialssaidhistoric reforms were attracting more insurers to write policies in the state.\nIn September I wroteoneofseveral2023pieceswarning of an impending recession, an opinion that became more of an outlier as the year went on and unemployment stayed low. If there\u2019s no recession by around next summer, I will happily admit I got this one wrong. For now, I\u2019m sticking with the call.\nIn October I wrote a newsletterheadlined, \u201cIn Argentina, the U.S. Dollar Could Soon Become King,\u201d referring to the plan of the country\u2019s leading presidential candidate, Javier Milei, to dollarize the Argentine economy. He won in November, took office this month and immediatelyembarkedon a promised austerity campaign, which includes slashing government spending and devaluing the currency. But Milei, a far-right economist who calls himself an anarcho-capitalist, isn\u2019t moving to replace the peso with the dollar. At leastnot yet.\nAlso in October Iwrotethat sales of most Apple Watches \u201cmay well drop 100 percent \u2014 to literally zero \u2014 the day after Christmas\u201d because of a ruling by the International Trade Commission that they contain parts that infringe on patents held by two other companies. That seemed far-fetched at the time. Surely Apple would make a deal with the patent holders or work around the infringing parts or something. But no. This week Applesaidit would pause sales of the models online on Thursday and in stores on Christmas Eve. It added that it \u201cis pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.\u201d Remarkable.\nIn November Ijumpedinto the OpenAI drama at the peak of the turmoil. At the time of publication, the OpenAI board had fired Sam Altman as chief executive officer, Microsoft had given him a job, and more than 700 of Open AI\u2019s 770 employees had signed a letter saying they might quit to join Altman unless the four-person board resigned. Things got patched up after that. Late on the day after the newsletter came out, OpenAIreached an agreementfor Altman to return as C.E.O. Three of the four board members resigned. One of theirreplacements\u2014 and I really didn\u2019t see this coming \u2014 is the economist Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard.\nFinally, last week Iwroteabout the anticapitalist Chicago artist Penny Pinch, whose works were about to go on sale last Friday in an auction in which asking prices would start high and then drop hourly. I checked in this week with Allan Weinberger, the director and founder of A Very Serious Gallery in Chicago, where Penny Pinch shows his work, to find out how things went. \u201cVery well,\u201d he told me. The small pieces all sold, at prices from $250 to $2,500, he said. The auction for the big pieces was still going on as of Tuesday. Prices for them were dropping daily rather than hourly. \u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of meat left on the bones,\u201d he said.\nThis stuff is just so interesting to me. I\u2019m glad it seems to interest you, too. Please email me your ideas for newsletter topics in 2024 at coy-newsletter@nytimes.com.\nYournewsletteron the majlis at COP28 was very enlightening and encouraging to me. I could not but think of the recent efforts by the Catholic Church on synods and synodality. Their discussions take place at round tables \u2014 every participant is heard.\nSue CarringtonForest Hills, N.Y.\nIn the 14th century, cooperation was necessary in the Netherlands. The people had to make decisions regarding the dikes and on whose land they would be built. It was accomplished in round table meetings.\nCornelis van DijkCary, N.C.\n\u201cThere has been so much talk of an impending recession for so long that those imbalances, which often result from excessive leverage or risk taking, have not built up. We thought we were talking ourselves into a recession, but we might have ended up talking ourselves out of one instead.\u201d\n\u2014 Bank of America economists, \u201cHow to Talk to Your Family About the Economy Over the Holidays,\u201d a bank research report (Dec. 15, 2023)"

        "title": "Apple to Pause Selling New Versions of Its Watch After Losing Patent Dispute",
        "fulltext": "Apple said on Monday that it would pause sales of its flagship smartwatches online starting Thursday and at retail locations on Christmas Eve.\nTwo months ago, Apple lost a patent case over the technology its smartwatches use to detect people\u2019s blood oxygen levels. The company was ordered to stop selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 after Christmas, which could set off a run on sales of the watches in the final week of holiday shopping.\nThe move by Apple follows a ruling by the International Trade Commission in October that found several Apple Watches infringe on patents held by Masimo, a medical technology company in Irvine, Calif.\nIn court, Masimo detailed how Apple poached its top executives and more than a dozen other employees before later releasing a watch with pulse oximeter capabilities \u2014 whichmeasures the percentage of oxygen that red blood cells carryfrom the lungs to the body \u2014 that were patented by Masimo.\nTo avoid a complete ban on sales, Apple had two months to cut a deal with Masimo to license its technology, or it could appeal to the Biden administration to reverse the ruling.\nBut Joe Kiani, the chief executive of Masimo, said in an interview that Apple had not engaged in licensing negotiations. Instead, he said that Apple had appealed to President Biden to veto the I.T.C. ruling, which Mr. Kiani knows because the administration contacted Masimo about Apple\u2019s request.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to make the agency look like it\u2019s helping patent trolls,\u201d Mr. Kiani said of the I.T.C.\nApple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on Mr. Kiani\u2019s remarks. In a statement, the company said, \u201cApple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.\u201d\nThe Biden administration didn\u2019t immediately respond to request for comment.\nMr. Kiani said that he was willing to sell Apple a chip that Masimo had designed to provide pulse oximeter readings on the Apple Watch. The chip is currently in aMasimo medical watch, called the W1, that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The device uses algorithms to process red and near-infrared light to determine how oxygen-rich is the blood in arteries.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t want to use our chip, I\u2019ll work with them to make their product good,\u201d Mr. Kiani said. \u201cOnce it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019m happy to give them a license.\u201d\nApple introduced its first watch with pulse oximetry in 2020. It has included the technology, which it calls \u201cblood oxygen,\u201d in subsequent models. But unlike Masimo\u2019s W1 device, Apple hasn\u2019t had its watches cleared by the F.D.A. for use as a medical device for pulse oximetry.\nThe Apple Watch accounts for nearly $20 billion of the company\u2019s $383.29 billion in annual sales, according to Bernstein Research, a financial research firm. Apple is the largest smartwatch seller in the world and accounts for about a third of all smartwatch sales, according toCounterpoint Research, a tech research firm.\nApple has had success persuading presidents in the past to veto I.T.C. rulings. In 2013,the Obama administration overturneda ban on the sale of some iPhones and iPads, after the court determined that Apple had violated a patent that Samsung owned."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Newest Headache: An App That Upended Its Control Over Messaging",
        "fulltext": "For years, Ben Black\u2019s phone annoyed his family. It was the only Android device in a family message group with eight iPhones. Because of him, videos and photos would arrive in low resolution and there would be green bubbles of text amid bubbles of blue.\nBut a new app called Beeper Mini gave him the ability to change that.\nMr. Black, 25, used the app to create an account for Apple\u2019s messaging service, iMessage, with his Google Pixel phone number. For the first time, every message the family exchanged had a blue bubble and members were able to use perks like emojis and animations.\nSince it was introduced on Dec. 5, Beeper Mini has quickly become a headache and potential antitrust problem for Apple. It has poked a hole in Apple\u2019s messaging system, while critics say it has demonstrated how Apple bullies potential competitors.\nApple was caught by surprise when Beeper Mini gave Android devices access to its modern, iPhone-only service. Less than a week after Beeper Mini\u2019s launch, Apple blocked the app by changing its iMessage system. It said the app created a security and privacy risk.\nApple\u2019s reaction set off a game of Whac-a-Mole, with Beeper Mini finding alternative ways to operate and Apple finding new ways to block the app in response.\nThe duel has raised questions in Washington about whether Apple has used its market dominance over iMessage to block competition and force consumers to spend more on iPhones than lower-priced alternatives.\nThe Justice Department has taken interest in the case. Beeper Mini met with the department\u2019s antitrust lawyers on Dec. 12, two people familiar with the meeting said. Eric Migicovsky, a co-founder of the app\u2019s parent company, Beeper, declined to comment on the meeting, but the department is in the middle of a four-year-old investigation into Apple\u2019s anticompetitive behavior.\nThe Federal Trade Commission said ina blog poston Thursday that it would scrutinize \u201cdominant\u201d players that \u201cuse privacy and security as a justification to disallow interoperability\u201d between services. The post did not name any companies.\nThe battle also caught the attention of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust. The committee\u2019s leadership \u2014 Senators Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah \u2014 wrote a letter to the Justice Department expressing concern that Apple was snuffing out competition.\nApple declined to comment on the letter.\nThe questions coming from Washington cut to the heart of today\u2019s smartphone competition. Rival smartphone makers credit iMessage with helping Apple expand its smartphone market share in the United States to more than 50 percent of smartphones sold, up from 41 percent in 2018,according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm.\nMessaging has been a key part of Apple\u2019s strategy to sell more iPhones. For years, it has made exchanges between iPhones and Android devices as basic as the texts between decades-old flip phones. Texts between iPhone users appear in blue and can be tapped to give a thumbs up, but texts with Android users appear in green and have no simple perks.\nAndroid companies have tried to fight back. An Android smartphone maker, Nothing,has collaborated with an app called Sunbirdto offer iMessage. Google, which has developed the Android operating system,has pressured Apple to adopta technology called rich communication services, which would make it possible to send high-resolution video and images between competing smartphones.\nBut their efforts have not made much of a dent. Last month, Apple said it would adopt the technology in the coming year. The move means Android users will enjoy benefits like sharing higher-resolution videos but be stuck with the green bubbles for text messages, which have become stigmatized andassociated with less wealth.\n\u201cEveryone is watching to see what kind of response Apple is going to have to Beeper Mini,\u201d said Cory Doctorow, a special adviser to the digital rights advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation who has written abook about interoperabilityacross different technologies. \u201cWe can\u2019t tell how worried they are internally, but their response could have a huge impact on how messaging works.\u201d\nProtecting iMessage is a decade-old strategy at Apple. In 2013, Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s head of software, opposed making iMessage workable on competitors\u2019 devices because it would \u201cremove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,\u201d according toemails releasedduring the company\u2019scourtroom fight with Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, has resisted calls to change that position. Hetold an iPhone owner at a conference last yearthat the solution to green text messages was to buy iPhones for friends and family members.\nBeeper brought a different approach to messaging. Mr. Migicovsky created the company in 2020 to build a single messaging app that could send texts across multiple services, including WhatsApp and Signal.\nMr. Migicovsky managed to integrate most messaging services, except iMessage. Unlike its peers, Apple did not offer a web app, making it difficult to connect with its service. The only way Beeper could integrate iMessage was to route messages through Mac computers and then to an iPhone. The process delayed messages and made them less secure.\nAs Beeper struggled with iMessage, a teenager in Bethlehem, Pa., found an alternative solution. James Gill, a 16-year-old computer hobbyist, made it his personal goal to figure out how iMessage worked. He used software to decrypt his iMessages and determined that Apple used its push notification system \u2014 the same one that delivers news alerts \u2014 to ferry messages between devices.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t genius insight,\u201d said Mr. Gill, a junior at Saucon Valley High School. \u201cI was just poking at it for a long time.\u201d\nIn June, Mr. Gill published his findings on GitHub, a software platform where programmers share code. When Mr. Migicovsky saw the post, he thought it could help Beeper solve its iMessage problem. He offered Mr. Gill a job making $100 an hour, a major increase from the $11 an hour the high schooler was making as a cashier at McDonald\u2019s.\nThe job has been more involved than Mr. Migicovsky or Mr. Gill expected. Since Beeper Mini\u2019s release this month, Apple has changed iMessage about three times, Mr. Migicovsky said.\nEach change by Apple required an adjustment by Beeper. Its latest solution involves routing registration information to Beeper Mini users through their personal Mac computers.\n\u201cTo block it entirely, they\u2019ll have to come up with a way to require an iPhone serial number,\u201d Mr. Gill said. \u201cBeeper will still come up with a workaround.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman said it would continue to update iMessage because it could not verify that Beeper kept its messages encrypted. \u201cThese techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks,\u201d she said in a statement.\nMr. Migicovsky disagrees. Instead of allowing Android customers to send encrypted messages to iPhone customers, he said, Apple is trying to force them to exchange unencrypted text messages. He has posted Beeper\u2019s software code on the web and encouraged Apple and cybersecurity experts to review it.\nMatthew Green, an associate professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University, said Apple had some legitimate security concerns and warned that an extended fight between the two companies could potentially introduce vulnerabilities that criminals could exploit.\n\u201cA world where Apple works with third-party clients in a supported way is a good one,\u201d Mr. Green said. \u201cA world where Beeper and Apple try to fight each other in a tit-for-tat arms race is a bad one.\u201d\nIn an attempt to end the standoff, Mr. Migicovsky said, he emailed Mr. Cook, but Apple\u2019s chief has not responded.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t our intention,\u201d Mr. Migicovsky said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it work, within our control, for the good of the chat world.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "The final big test of the year for investors is set to arrive on Friday with the release at 8:30 a.m. Eastern of the Personal Consumption Expenditures report, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge.\nIt\u2019s been a banner year for markets.Investors shrugged off high inflation and rising interest rates, sending the S&P 500 up more than 23 percent as of Thursday\u2019s close.\nCan it keep going?Here are some other big numbers from the past year, and what\u2019s to come:\n3.3 percent:According to Reuters, market participants expect Friday\u2019s reading for the core measure of P.C.E., which strips out food and fuel, to haverisen by 3.3 percenton an annualized basis. That would be a decent improvement on last month\u2019s figure and give the Fed more flexibility to lower interest rates next year.\n152:The rate-cuts discussion has gone global \u2014 even if the Fed isone of the only major central banks talking openlyabout the prospect. Michael Hartnett, an investment strategist at Bank of America, predicts a rate-cut bonanza \u2014 152 in all. It will be the first year since 2020 in which \u201ccuts outpace rate hikes,\u201d he wrote in an investor note last week. BofA also sees the Fed cutting its prime lending rate by 1.5 percentage points next year.\n75 percent:Rate cuts are typically good news for tech investors. Lower borrowing costs have tended to unleash spending by households and companies, a possible tailwind for Big Tech\u2019s bottom line. Such enthusiasm is perhaps best seen in the performance of the so-called Magnificent Seven, a group of tech firms that drove an A.I.-fueled rally throughout much of the year.\nThe stocks \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 hadclimbed by 75 percent this year, as of last week, and now account for roughly 30 percent of the index\u2019s weighted value. The other 493 companies? As a group, they are underperforming the S&P 500.\n162 percent:Bitcoin looks like a runaway contender for the 2023 market champ. The digital currency is up 162 percent as of Friday morning, even as regulators on both sides of the Atlanticcrack downon the crypto sector\u2019s biggest names.\nPresident Biden calls for \u201cserious scrutiny\u201d of the U.S. Steel deal.Lael Brainard, Biden\u2019s national economic adviser, said on Thursday that Nippon Steel\u2019s planned $14 billion acquisitionshould be reviewedto address potential national security and supply chain concerns.\nThe Biden administration will blacklist banks that fund Russia\u2019s war machine.Anexecutive orderset to be issued on Friday will allow the U.S. to impose sanctions on financial institutions that help Russia secure equipment and materials to be used in its fight against Ukraine. The measures would seek to cut off rule-breaking firms from the American financial system, and comes as congressional Republicans stymie efforts to increase funding for Ukraine\u2019s military.\nRudy Giuliani files for bankruptcy protection.The former New York mayormade the movea day after a federal judge ordered him to pay $148 million in damages to two Georgia election workers for falsely accusing them of tampering with ballots in the 2020 election. The filing gives Giuliani, who faces millions in potential damages in other lawsuits, a means to pause payouts while he considers an appeal.\nNike shares plummet on weak outlook.The sportswear giant\u2019s stock was down more than 10 percent in premarket trading, a day after the companyunveiled $2 billion in cost cutsand warned of slowing sales, especially in China and Europe. Nike\u2019s troubles are another ominous sign that the consumers are beginning to pull back on spending.\nChinese tech stocks plunged on Friday, wiping $80 billion off the market capitalization of some of the country\u2019s biggest companies, after the authoritiesproposed a new crackdown on online gaming.\nThe draft rules unveiled on Friday suggest that Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, intends to maintain tight control of private enterprise despite recent efforts to project a more welcoming image to business.\nTwo giants led the rout.Hong Kong-listed shares in Tencent, the country\u2019s biggest company by market capitalization and a major overseas investor (including a big stake in Fortnite\u2019s maker, Epic Games) fell as much as 16 percent. The stock of NetEase plummeted by a record 28 percent.\nThe authorities blame gaming for a raft of social ills.China is the top online gaming market, with about 650 million users and annual revenues of $45 billion last year, according to Goldman Sachs. Officialssay the industry encourages addiction, and they blame too much time online for causing a spike in nearsightedness among children. Friday\u2019s proposals would force companies to limit the amount of money and time players can spend online, and block content that could compromise national security.\nXi has tried to calm worries about the Communist Party\u2019s role in private business,after years of cracking down to ensure that companies support the state\u2019s objectives above all else. Beijing signaled a truce earlier this year, with regulators declaring that the\u201clegitimate rights\u201d of companieswould be respected. Last month, Xi told U.S. business leaders at a banquet in San Francisco that China was a huge market and a friend \u2014 and received a standing ovation.\nBut Friday\u2019s draft rules are the latest example of rhetoric clashing with reality.\nPressure appears to be rising onClaudine Gay, Harvard\u2019s president, as the fallout over how America\u2019s elite universities have handled antisemitism on campus shows no signs of abating.\nIn recent weeks, the billionaire Len Blavatnik, a big donor to Harvard, told the school that he would pause giving any more money. He is the latest business leader to do so \u2014 or threaten to \u2014 as Harvard\u2019s wealthy donorsbecome increasingly disgruntledwith the school\u2019s handling of the crisis.\nDr. Gay\u2019s academic work is also under scrutiny over plagiarism allegations.The university this week said it found two new instances of what appeared to be \u201cduplicative language without appropriate attribution\u201d in her 1997 doctoral dissertation. Theplagiarism allegationsrange from the inclusion of brief snippets of technical definitions in her work to lightly paraphrased summaries of other scholars\u2019 writings without quotation marks, or direct citation.\nHarvard faculty are standing by Dr. Gay, even as others are now openlycalling for her to go.\nBlavatnik\u2019s foundation has given at least $270 million to Harvard,according to Bloomberg. This includes roughly $200 million to Harvard\u2019s medical school, which has named an institute after him. In a statement, Blavatnik\u2019s spokeswoman said that he would not resume donating \u201cuntil antisemitism at Harvard is addressed with real action.\u201d\nThe latest developments raise questions about the Harvard Corporation.The insular governing board hired Dr. Gay after a relatively speedy search last year. The board just days agocleared Dr. Gay of \u201cresearch misconduct.\u201d Asked on Thursday whether the Harvard Corporation continued to stand by the president, a spokesman for the university referred toa Dec. 12 statementof unanimous support.\nRaymond Dirks gained a kind of immortality in 1983, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Dirks v. S.E.C. The ruling found that Dirks, the controversial Wall Street research analyst, had not engaged in insider trading when he tipped off clients after blowing the whistle on Equity Funding Corp., the biggest corporate scandal of its day.\nDecades of white-collar prosecutions, from theMichael MilkenandIvan Boeskyscandals of the 1980s to the 2012conviction of Rajat Gupta, rest on the foundation of Dirks, as the case is known.\nDirks died in New York on Dec. 9at age 89. A classic contrarian, with an acerbic personality to match, he spent much of his life tilting with Wall Street and regulatory establishments, writes The Times\u2019s James Stewart.\nBorn in Ft. Wayne, Ind., Dirks joined Bankers Trust after college,but chafed inside a big institution. With his brother Lee, he founded a research firm where he specialized in insurance stocks. After learning from an inside source in 1973 that top executives at Equity Funding were counterfeiting insurance policies and creating fictitious customers to inflate revenue and the company\u2019s stock price, Dirks went to both the S.E.C. and The Wall Street Journal. Neither took the bait.\nBut many of Dirks\u2019s institutional clients took him seriously,dumping their positions in Equity Funding. The resulting market turmoil prompted a front-page Wall Street Journal story. Within weeks, the company was in receivership and the S.E.C. was investigating, and its top executives eventually went to jail. Taking a hard line on insider trading, the S.E.C. then sued Dirks.\nHis trial inspired a new definition of insider trading.Dirks himself didn\u2019t trade Equity Funding stock or profit from the information, nor did his source. He had tried to alert regulators and journalists. His actions brought the fraud to a halt and saved Equity Funding policy buyers from untold further losses. While vindicating Dirks, a divided Supreme Court took what had been a relatively simple standard for insider trading and required that it be done with knowledge that the original source violated a duty of confidentiality and experienced personal gain.\nThat opinion has spawned decades of litigation.As recently as 2015, the Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals was still wrestling with the meaning of \u201cpersonal gain.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably the most problematic case in the canon of insider trading law,\u201d said Jed S. Rakoff, a federal judge for the Southern District of New York who has been called upon to interpret the sometimes frustratingly ambiguous opinion.\nHistory has been kinder to Dirks.\u201cHe was a hero,\u201d said Professor John C. Coffee Jr., an expert on insider trading and securities law at Columbia Law School. He will be remembered as \u201cthe Woodward and Bernstein of corporate fraud.\u201d\nDeals\nBristol Myers agreed to a$14 billion deal to buy Karuna Therapeuticsto boost its psychiatric and neurological drugs business.

        "fulltext": "Apple resumed sales of its newest smartwatches on Thursday, a day after a federal appeals court temporarily reversed an earlier ban on their import and sale in the United States.\nBut the watches\u2019 fate will ultimately depend on how a continuing legal fight plays out in federal court over the next few weeks.\nThe companypaused sales of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2in its flagship stores on Dec. 21 and at retail locations on Christmas Eve. The pause was the result of a patent case that Apple lost in October.\nThe ruling in that case became final on Tuesday, when President Biden\u2019s administration declined to step in and reverse it. But on Wednesday, a federal appeals court ordered the government not to enforce it \u201cuntil further notice\u201d while the court considers Apple\u2019s appeal.\nYes. The company said on Wednesday that it would restart retail sales of the two new watches at some Apple stores that day, and in more stores by Saturday. Apple confirmed that the two watches were also made available for sale online on Thursday.\nThe case against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission focuses on technology that some Apple watches use to detect a wearer\u2019s pulse rate by measuring the percentage of oxygen in their blood.\nThe commissionruled in Octoberthat some models of Apple watches were infringing on patents held by two medical technology companies in California, Masimo and Cercacor Laboratories. It ordered Apple to stop selling the Apple Watch Series 9 and Watch Ultra 2 after Christmas.\nThe Biden administration had 60 days to decide whether to veto the commission\u2019s ruling. On Tuesday, it said it hadchosen not to, making the ruling final.\nBut on Wednesday, the federal appeals court granted a fresh request from Apple to pause enforcement of the ruling as the appeals process plays out. It gave the commission until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple\u2019s request for a further delay in enforcing the ban.\nNo, although the legal battle will ultimately determine whether sales, service and repairs of Apple\u2019s newest watches continue over the long term.\nThe battle may hinge partly on a proposed redesign of the two watches that Apple has submitted to the United States customs authorities for approval.\nThe ban that was temporarily paused on Wednesday applied to several other models that use the same pulse-monitoring technology, including the Apple Watch Series 6, 7 and 8, and all models of the Apple Watch Ultra. But those models are not currently sold at Apple stores or on the company\u2019s website. (The ban did not apply to the Apple Watch SE.)\nThe ruling only affected sales in the United States.\nJohnny Diazcontributed reporting."

        "title": "Google\u2019s Antitrust Setback Could Remake the App Economy, and More",
        "fulltext": "Epic Games on Monday finally achieved one of its longstanding goals: weakening one of the two major companies behind the modern mobile app ecosystem. A jury found thatGoogle violated antitrust lawsby maintaining tight control of its app store, harming the Fortnite maker and other developers.\nGoogle said it would appeal. But the verdict could rewrite the economics of mobile apps \u2014 and is a blow against the power of Big Tech.\nThe back story:In 2020,Epic encouraged Fortnite players to buy in-game items directly from it to protest against Apple and Google taking cuts of all in-app payments made via their app store payment systems. The tech giants briefly banned the popular game from their stores, and Epic sued both.\nApple won its lawsuit in 2021, though that trial was decided by a judge, not a jury. Epic persisted with its case against Google, even after other plaintiffs like the dating app operator Match dropped out.\nThe jury took less than four hours to decide against the search giant.It found that the company broke antitrust laws with both its Play Store and an in-app billing system. It also found that Google had put unreasonable constraints on other app store operators\u2019 ability to compete \u2014 including via Project Hug, an initiative that paid developers big sums to keep their apps on the Play Store.\n\u201cFree Fortnite!\u201d Tim Sweeney, Epic\u2019s C.E.O., posted on the social media platform X after the verdict. (His company reckons that it could keep hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenue if it won.)\nEpic wants to open up Google\u2019s devices, not monetary damages.That includes forcing the company to allow other app stores on its Android phones and tablets. Developers may also have new ways of charging users without having to fork over a cut to Google.\nThat said, a judge will determine actual remedies next year. A Google spokesman said the company would \u201ccontinue to defend the Android business model.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear what the decision means for Apple, whose case over Epic may go to the Supreme Court.)\nIt\u2019s a blow to Google as it faces pressure from Washington and beyond.The app store, which accounted for about $12 billion in operating profit in 2021, makes up just a portion of the company\u2019s bottom line.\nBut Google is fighting to protect some of its biggest moneymakers. It\u2019s battling the Justice Department and dozens of statesover its dominance in search. And it is seeking todefend its advertising technology businessagainst E.U. regulators\u2019 efforts to break up the division.\nThe Donald Trump immunity question heads to the Supreme Court.Justices on Mondayagreed to examinewhether the former president is shielded from prosecution. Jack Smith, the special counsel prosecuting Trump on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election, made the request ahead of a potential appeals court decision that could delay or sidetrack his case.\nHasbro announces big layoffs two weeks before Christmas.The toymaker behind Monopoly and Magic: The Gathering said it wouldcut roughly 1,100 jobs, or nearly 17 percent of its work force, as toy sales continue to slide since coronavirus pandemic-driven highs. Separately, EY reportedly plans to lay offdozens of its U.S. partnersamid slowing business.\nChoice Hotels is said to plan a hostile bid for Wyndham.The hotel operator will begin an exchange offer for Wyndham shares and name a slate of directors for its rival\u2019s board,according to The Wall Street Journal. The action comes after Choice\u2019s previous takeover approach was rebuffed.\nMore twists in the saga of Shohei Ohtani\u2019s record-breaking contract.The M.L.B. star will deferall but $2 millionof the $70 million he\u2019s owed each year by the Los Angeles Dodgers until his 10-year contract ends, The Athletic reports. The move is meant to help the team navigate the league\u2019s luxury tax.\nThe latestConsumer Price Indexreport \u2014 due out at 8:30 a.m. Eastern \u2014 is expected to show little progress in the fight to bring down inflation, adding uncertainty to the Fed\u2019s long-term policy on interest rates.\nThe numbers to watch:Economists have forecast that overall C.P.I. rose 3.1 percent on an annual basis in November, a slight decrease from the October reading. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food, is expected to come in at 4 percent, showing no improvement from the previous month\u2019s report.\nWall Street has had to absorb mixed signals on inflation.Last month\u2019s C.P.I. report undercut analysts\u2019 estimates, setting off a rally in stocks and bonds that pushed the S&P 500 to a 20-month high, as investors became more optimistic that the Fed was done raising borrowing costs.\nBut Friday\u2019s jobs report showed strong hiring and wage gains in November. That could make Fed officialsmore cautiousabout their 2024 rates outlook.\nThe central bank is expected to leave its prime lending rate unchanged tomorrow, at its final meeting of the year. Butquestions aboundabout what comes next, making Tuesday\u2019s C.P.I. report an even more important gauge.\nOn Tuesday morning, traders were pricing in a roughly 80 percent chance of a rate cut by May. But cutting rates while inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2 percent inflation target could havedamaging effects on long-term growth.\nInvestors got some hopeful news on Monday. The New York Fed\u2019s monthlyinflation survey showedrespondents at their most optimistic about the path of consumer prices since April 2021, helped by lower gasoline prices and education costs.\nHarvard\u2019s president, Claudine Gay, is expected tosurvive efforts to push her outamid an uproar over her stance on combating antisemitism on campus. But new details are emerging of how one of her peers lost her job over the controversy.\nBig donors to the University of Pennsylvania waged anaggressive and sustained campaignagainst Liz Magill, the school\u2019s president, and Scott Bok, the chairman of its board of trustees. Magill stepped down on Saturday, and Bok resigned soon after.\nAn activist campaign was waged at Penn.Marc Rowan, the private equity billionaire who chairs the advisory board of Wharton, Penn\u2019s business school, spearheaded the effort in public and private. Rowan cut his donations and urged others to do the same \u2014 and emailed Penn\u2019s board daily.\nAs one trustee toldThe Wall Street Journal: \u201cIt\u2019s like running a proxy fight against your own company.\u201d\nThe campaign extended beyond Penn.Wall Street bankers threatened to avoid doing business with Bok, who was also the chair and C.E.O. of the boutique investment bank Greenhill. Apollo reportedly even tried tothwart the sale of Greenhill to Mizuho of Japanby suggesting that Bok\u2019s leadership at Penn was bad for Greenhill. (The $550 million deal still closed this month.)\nMagill\u2019s disastrous House testimony last week was a turning point.By Saturday, Magill and Bok had lost the support of Penn\u2019s board. Several trustees decided that their vice chair, Julie Platt, and William Lauder, the heir to a cosmetics fortune, should ask Magill and Bok to quit.\nMagill and Bok found out and announced their resignations before they were pushed out.\nBig questions remain, including:\nWhat does this mean for Bok?Will his peers welcome him back, and will Mizuho stand by him?\nIs Rowan done?As Magill\u2019s tenure neared its end, Rowan told some Wharton board members that he was wary of continuing to speak out publicly, claiming to be worried about the perception that he and other donors helped oust her. But will he get involved in other big decisions, like picking Penn\u2019s next president?\n\u2014David Mills, the Stanford University law professor who led the defense of the FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried as a favor to the crypto entrepreneur\u2019s parents.\nThe United Nations climate summit in Dubai was supposed to wrap up on Tuesday morning, but a fierce debate over whether to phase out fossil fuels has pushed negotiators to the brink of a no-deal.\nA draft proposal was labeled a\u201cdeath warrant.\u201dIt calls for cuts in the \u201cconsumption and production of fossil fuels\u201d by 2050. But thatdoesn\u2019t go far enoughfor some governments, including the European Union and a number of island nations vulnerable to rising sea levels. \u201cThe Republic of the Marshall Islands did not come here to sign our death warrant,\u201d said a minister from the Pacific country.\nThe proposed agreement confirmed the worst fears of climate activists, green investors and scientists,who were skepticalthat an event held in an oil-dependent country would achieve meaningful progress on cutting fossil fuel use. Al Gore, the former vice president,said on Mondaythat the draft agreement read \u201cas if OPEC dictated it word for word.\u201d It was \u201cOf the Petrostates, By the Petrostates and For the Petrostates,\u201d he said.\nThe \u201cphase-out\u201d camp wants nothing short of elimination of fossil fuel use,to limit global warming to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius. But Saudi Arabia and other oil-exporting nationsstrongly oppose such pronouncementsin any final agreement, and the draft text seemed more in line with their thinking. It referenced, for example, an \u201corderly\u201d or \u201cjust\u201d reduction of fossil fuels.\nThe host nation is trying to break the impasse. Sultan Al Jaber, the event\u2019s president who also runs Abu Dhabi\u2019s national oil company, delayed publication of the draft agreement while a compromise was sought. But that was looking unlikely on Tuesday.\nThe summit has made some progress.Calls to triple renewables as an energy source by 2030have been cheeredby countries and business leaders.

        "title": "Apple Explores A.I. Deals With News Publishers",
        "fulltext": "Apple has opened negotiations in recent weeks with major news and publishing organizations, seeking permission to use their material in the company\u2019s development of generative artificial intelligence systems, according to four people familiar with the discussions.\nThe technology giant has floated multiyear deals worth at least $50 million to license the archives of news articles, said the people with knowledge of talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations. The news organizations contacted by Apple include Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue and The New Yorker; NBC News; and IAC, which owns People, The Daily Beast and Better Homes and Gardens.\nThe negotiations mark one of the earliest examples of how Apple is trying to catch up to rivals in the race to develop generative A.I., which allows computers to create images and chat like a human. The technology, which artificial intelligence experts refer to as neural networks, is built byusing troves of photos or digital text to recognize patterns. By analyzing thousands of cat photos, for instance, a computer can learn to recognize a cat.\nMicrosoft, OpenAI, Google, Meta and other companies have released chatbots and other products built with the technology. The tools could change the way people work and generate billions of dollars in sales.\nBut Apple has been absent from the public discussion of A.I. Its virtual assistant,Siri, has remained largely stagnantin the decade since its release.\nA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment. During a call with analysts last month, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said Apple has work \u201cgoing on\u201d connected to A.I. but declined to elaborate.\nSome of the publishers contacted by Apple were lukewarm on the overture. After years of on-again-off-again commercial deals with tech companies like Meta, the owner of Facebook, publishershave grown waryof jumping into business with Silicon Valley.\nSeveral publishing executives were concerned that Apple\u2019s terms were too expansive, according to three people familiar with the negotiations. The initial pitch covered broad licensing of publishers\u2019 archives of published content, with publishers potentially on the hook for any legal liabilities that could stem from Apple\u2019s use of their content.\nApple was also vague about how it intended to apply generative A.I. to the news industry, the people said, a potential competitive risk given Apple\u2019s substantial audience for news on its devices.\nStill, some news executives were optimistic that Apple\u2019s approach might eventually lead to a meaningful partnership. Two people familiar with the discussions struck a positive note on the long-term prospects of a deal, contrasting Apple\u2019s approach of asking for permission with behavior from other artificial intelligence-enabled companies, which have been accused of seeking licensing deals with news organizations after they had already used their content to train generative models.\nIn recent years, Apple executives have been debating how to accumulate the data needed to build generative A.I. products, according to two people familiar with the work. Some of its rivals have been accused of taking written material from across the internet without the permission of the artists, writers and coders who created it,leading to several copyright lawsuits.\nApple has been reluctant to take information from the internet, partly because of its commitment to privacy. After it acquired the social analytics start-up Topsy in 2013, Apple\u2019s leadership asked that Topsy stop collecting information from Twitter, saying that doing so violated the company\u2019s policy against collecting data on Apple customers, who might also post on the social media site, these two people said.\nThe explosion of artificial intelligence has raised alarms among news executives, many of whom are concerned that generative A.I. products like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT could draw in readers who would otherwise consume their news on platforms for their own subscribers and advertisers.\nPrint news organizations, which decades ago saw their lucrative classifieds business demolished by online competitors, have been particularly wary about striking deals with A.I. organizations, engaging cautiously with an eye toward preserving their existing businesses.\nIn a statement, an OpenAI spokesman said that the company respects \u201cthe rights of content creators and owners and believes they should benefit from A.I. technology,\u201d citing its recent deals with the American Journalism Project and the German publisher Axel Springer.\n\u201cWe\u2019re optimistic we will continue to find mutually beneficial ways to work together in support of a rich news ecosystem,\u201d the OpenAI spokesman said."

        "title": "The 2023 Good Tech Awards",
        "fulltext": "In the tech industry, 2023 was a year of transformation.\nSpurred by the success of last year\u2019s breakout tech star, ChatGPT, Silicon Valley\u2019s giants rushed to turn themselves into artificial intelligence companies, jamming generative A.I. features into their products andracing to buildtheir own, more powerful A.I. models. They did so while navigating an uncertain tech economy, with layoffs and pivots galore, and while trying to keep their aging business models aloft.\nNot everything went smoothly. There weremisbehaving chatbots,crypto foiblesandbank failures. And then in November, ChatGPT\u2019s maker, OpenAI, melted down (and quickly reconstituted itself) over afailed boardroom coup, proving once and for all that there\u2019s no such thing in tech as resting on your laurels.\nEvery December in my Good Tech Awards column, I try to neutralize my own negativity bias by highlighting a few lesser-known tech projects that struck me as beneficial. This year, as you\u2019ll see, many of the awards involve artificial intelligence, but my goal was to sidestep the polarized debates about whether A.I. will destroy the world or save it and instead focus on the here and now. What is A.I. good for today? Whom is it helping? What kinds of important breakthroughs are already being made with A.I. as a catalyst?\nAs always, my award criteria are vague and subjective, and no actual trophies or prizes are involved. These are just small, personal blurbs of appreciation for a few tech projects I thought had real, obvious value to humanity in 2023.\nAccessibility \u2014 the term for making tech products more usable by people with disabilities \u2014 has been an underappreciated area of improvement this year. Several recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 such as multimodal A.I. models that can interpret images and turn text into speech \u2014 have made it possible for tech companies to build new features for disabled users. This is, I\u2019d argue, an unambiguously good use of A.I., and an area where people\u2019s lives are already improving in meaningful ways.\nI asked Steven Aquino, a freelance journalist who specializes in accessible tech, to recommend his top accessibility breakthroughs of 2023. He recommended Be My Eyes, a company that makes technology for people with impaired vision. In 2023, Be My Eyes announceda feature known as Be My AI, powered by OpenAI\u2019s technology, that allows blind and low-sighted people to aim their smartphone camera at an object and have that object described for them in natural language.\nMr. Aquino also pointed me to Apple\u2019s newPersonal Voice feature, which is built into iOS 17 and uses A.I. voice-cloning technology to create a synthetic version of a user\u2019s voice. The feature was designed for people who are at risk of losing their ability to speak, such as those with a recent diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or another degenerative disease, and gives them a way to preserve their speaking voice so that their friends, relatives and loved ones can hear from them long into the future.\nI\u2019ll throw in one more promising accessibility breakthrough: A research team at the University of Texas at Austinannouncedthis year that it had used A.I. to develop a \u201cnoninvasive language decoder\u201d that can translate thoughts into speech \u2014 read people\u2019s minds, essentially. This kind of technology, which uses an A.I. language model to decode brain activity from fMRI scans, sounds like science fiction. But it could make it easier for people with speech loss or paralysis to communicate. And it doesn\u2019t require putting an A.I. chip in your brain, which is an added bonus.\nWhen CRISPR, the Nobel Prize-winning gene editing tool, broke into public consciousness a decade ago, doomsayers predicted that it might lead to a dystopian world of gene-edited \u201cdesigner babies\u201d and nightmare eugenics experiments. Instead, the technology has been allowing scientists to make steady progress toward treating a number of harrowing diseases.\nIn December,the Food and Drug Administration approvedthe first gene-editing therapy for humans \u2014 a treatment for sickle cell disease, called Exa-cel, that was jointly developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals of Boston and CRISPR Therapeutics of Switzerland.\nExa-cel uses CRISPR to edit the gene responsible for sickle cell, a debilitating blood disease that affects roughly 100,000 Americans, most of whom are Black. While it\u2019s still wildly expensive and difficult to administer, the treatment offers new hope to sickle cell patients who have access to it.\nOne of the most funinterviews I did on my podcast this yearwas with Brent Seales, a professor at the University of Kentucky who has spent the past two decades trying to decipher a set of ancient papyrus manuscripts known as the Herculaneum Scrolls. The scrolls, which belonged to a library owned by Julius Caesar\u2019s father-in-law, were buried under a mountain of ash in 79 A.D. during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. They were so thoroughly carbonized that they couldn\u2019t be opened without ruining them.\nNow, A.I. has made it possible to read these scrolls without opening them. And this year, Dr. Seales teamed up with two tech investors, Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, to launch theVesuvius Challenge\u2014 offering prizes of up to $1 million to anyone who successfully deciphers the scrolls.\nThe grand prize has still not been won. But the competition sparked a frenzy of interest from amateur history buffs, and this year a 21-year-old computer science student, Luke Farritor,won a $40,000 intermediate prizefor deciphering a single word \u2014 \u201cpurple\u201d \u2014 from one of the scrolls. I love the idea of using A.I. to unlock wisdom from the ancient past, and I love the public-minded spirit of this competition.\nI spent a lot of time in 2023 being shuttled around San Francisco in self-driving cars. Robot taxis are a controversial technology \u2014 and there are still plenty of kinks to be worked out \u2014 but for the most part I buy the idea that self-driving cars will ultimately make our roads safer by replacing fallible, distracted human drivers with always-alert A.I. chauffeurs.\nCruise, one of the two companies that were giving robot taxi rides in San Francisco, hasimploded in recent days, after one of its vehicles struck and dragged a woman who had been hit by another car. California regulators said the company had misled them about the incident; Cruise pulled its cars from the streets, and its chief executive, Kyle Vogt, stepped down.\nBut not all self-driving cars are created equal, and this year I was grateful for the comparatively slow, methodical approach taken by Cruise\u2019s competitor, Waymo.\nWaymo, which was spun out of Google in 2016, has been logging miles on public roads for more than a decade, and it shows. The half-dozen rides I took in Waymo cars this year felt safer and smoother than the Cruise rides I took. And Waymo\u2019s safety data is compelling: According toa study the company conductedwith Swiss Re, an insurance firm, in 3.8 million self-driving miles Waymo\u2019s cars were significantly less likely to cause property damage than human-driven cars, and led to no bodily injury claims whatsoever.\nI\u2019ll put my cards on the table: I like self-driving cars, and I think society will be better off once they\u2019re widespread. But they have to be safe, and Waymo\u2019s slow-and-steady approach seems better suited to the task.\nOne of the more surprising \u2014 and, to my mind, heartening \u2014 tech trends of 2023 was seeing governments around the world get involved in trying to understand and regulate A.I.\nBut all that involvement requires work \u2014 and in the United States, a lot of that work has fallen to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a small federal agency that was previously better known for things like making sure clocks and scales were properly calibrated.\nThe Biden administration\u2019s executive order on artificial intelligence, released in October, designated NIST as one of the primary federal agencies responsible for keeping tabs on A.I. progress and mitigating its risks. The orderdirects the agencyto develop ways of testing A.I. systems for safety, come up with exercises to help A.I. companies identify potentially harmful uses of their products, and produce research and guidelines for watermarking A.I.-generated content, among other things.\nNIST, which employs about 3,400 people and has an annual budget of $1.24 billion, is tiny compared with other federal agencies doing critical safety work. (For scale: The Department of Homeland Security has an annual budget of nearly $100 billion.) But it\u2019s important that the government build up its own A.I. capabilities to effectively regulate the advances being made by private-sector A.I. labs, and we\u2019ll need to invest more in the work being done by NIST and other agencies in order to give ourselves a fighting chance.\nAnd on that note: Happy holidays, and see you next year!"
