        "title": "The Rise of Big Tech May Just Be Starting",
        "fulltext": "The stock market has lately soured on the technology industry. Stock prices of many of the largest companies are down this year, some slightly \u2014 shares of Apple and Google have fallen more than 6 percent \u2014 and some stupendously: Facebook's parent company, Meta, and Netflix have lost about a third of their value since the New Year. Because surging tech stocks drovea big part of the stock market\u2019s rise in 2021, theirdeclinehascontributed much to the market\u2019s fall. The S & P 500 is down by about 7 percent in 2022.\nIt\u2019s obvious why investors are spooked. Omicron, inflation, likely interest rate hikes, a possible war in Europe, Canadians acting veryun-Canadianly\u2014 unpredictable forces have taken hold of the global economy, so it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect trouble ahead for some of the largest companies in the world.\nBut in the last few weeks, as corporations announced their financial performance for the final months of 2021, I\u2019ve found it hard to focus on what might now go wrong for the tech industry.\nAmazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft \u2014the four American companiesnow worth more than a trillion dollars each (actually, Microsoft is above $2 trillion, and Apple nearly $3 trillion) \u2014reported enviable growthin 2021. Even Facebook\u2019s disappointing earnings were relative: The company\u2019s profits grew by35 percent in 2021, down fromnearly 60 percent growthin 2020.\nSo the much bigger story is that after all that has gone right during the pandemic for the largest companies in tech, they now seem poised to expand their reach and influence over the rest of the economy, rather than relinquish it.\nPerhaps it\u2019s not very surprising that the largest tech companies did really well during a pandemic that had a lot of us spending lots more time with technology. Yet the scale of their growth is staggering.\nAs Chaim Gartenberg of The Vergepointed out, Apple\u2019s revenue grew by more than $90 billion in 2021, about a third more than its revenue in 2020 \u2014 and this despite a global shortage of computer chips. Amazon\u2019s sales in 2021 were 67 percent larger than in 2019, the year before the pandemic; Google\u2019s 2021 revenue was nearly 60 percent greater than in 2019.\nI\u2019ve worn down my thesaurus looking for superlatives to underline how gobsmacking these numbers are. These were already among the largest corporations ever to have existed; in 2018, Apple became the first American company to reach a trillion-dollar market valuation. Companies of that size are just not supposed to grow as quickly as they have. For years,punditshave beenpredictingthat tech giants would eventually run up against the so-called \u201claw of large numbers.\u201d Yet Big Tech keeps breaking the law.\nWhat\u2019s driving tech giants\u2019 stupefying growth? It\u2019s not just that the pandemic drove a lot more usage of tech. A bigger deal, I think, is that the pandemic illustrated how much room there still is in our lives for adding even more tech \u2014 for our screens to become the primary portal through which a handful of companies capture a slice of everything we do.\nConsider, for instance, Apple\u2019s\u201cservices\u201d business\u2014 a division that includes, among other things, its App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and its music and TV subscription plans. Traditionally Apple has made a huge amount of money from selling hardware. But iPhonesaleshavegone up and down over the past half decade, which makes sense; eventually everyone who wants an iPhone will have an iPhone, and with each new iPhone only slightly better than the last, people will have fewer reasons to upgrade. Indeed, iPhone sales in Apple\u2019s holiday quarter in 2021grew by9 percent over 2020\u2014 solid, but nothing like thegrowth Apple once saw with the iPhone.\nAnd so Apple has increasingly turned to subscriptions and other online services for growth \u2014 essentially a way to grow not just by selling more iPhones, but by getting more money from each iPhone user. The plan is working spectacularly well. Apple reported that during 2020 its App Store billing and sales revenuegrew by 24 percentover the previous year. Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s finance chief, told investors last month that the company now has785 million paying subscribersto its various offerings \u2014 a number thatgrew by 165 million in the past year. For some perspective: Netflix hasabout 222 millionsubscribers in total.\nYou see a similar trend across the industry \u2014 Big Tech\u2019s not just getting more customers for its traditional businesses, but is expanding its ancillary businesses in ways that seem impossible. Amazon, for example, is not just an indomitable retailer and the largest cloud services provider (its Amazon Web Services cloud business nowhas a $71 billion annual revenuerun rate). The company alsodisclosed that its advertising business generated $31 billionin revenue in 2021, while Microsoft said its ad revenue exceeded $10 billion. Remember that ads are, in the scheme of things, a small part of the business for both companies \u2014 Amazon\u2019s $31 billion ad business is not even 10 percent of its annual revenue. And yet it dwarfs companies whose entire business is mainly ads \u2014 Snap, for example, which had $4 billion in revenue in 2021, or Pinterest, which sold less than $2.6 billion in ads.\nDan Ives and John Katsingris, analysts at the investment firm Wedbush Securities, wrote in a recent report that what we are seeing now is only the beginning of a long-term explosion in tech earnings. They estimated that companies would spend a trillion dollars on cloud services over the coming years, meaning that there is a lot more room for tech companies to keep growing and growing and growing. Apple\u2019s services business alonecould be worth $1.5 trillion, Ives has estimated. He and other pundits have called the coming investment boom in tech the\u201cFourth Industrial Revolution.\u201d\nThat sounds grandiose. And yet it\u2019s hard to see what stands in Big Tech\u2019s way. Lawmakers and regulators have expressed alarm over tech behemoths\u2019 market power, but with the midterm election looming and Republicans and Democrats still at odds over what exactly to do to curb tech giants\u2019 power, thewindow for new antimonopoly policymight be shrinking.\nI wonder if a few years from now we\u2019ll say that when it came to anticipating the future for Big Tech, we weren\u2019t thinking big enough.\nFarhad wants tochat with readers on the phone.

        "title": "Stocks climb as investors weigh a surprising jobs report and Amazon earnings.",
        "fulltext": "Data delayed at least 15 minutes\nSource: FactSet\nBy: Ella Koeze\nStocks on Wall Street rose on Friday, as an unexpectedly strong jobs report scrambled investors\u2019 expectations for coming interest rate increases and as the latest round of earnings reports offset some fears about declining corporate profits.\nThe S&P 500 climbed half a percent, a day after its steepest one-day drop in nearly a year. The index ended the week with a gain of 1.6 percent. The Nasdaq composite rose 1.6 percent on Friday.\nMarkets were initially unsteady after the government reported that U.S. employers added 467,000 jobs in January, well over expectations for an increase of about 125,000 jobs. The Labor Department also revised hiring numbers for the previous two months sharply higher.\nEconomists had cautioned against reading too much into Friday\u2019s report \u2014 noting that the data was collected in the first weeks of the year, when coronavirus cases reached 800,000 a day, and that quirks in the data might skew the results.\nBut investors took the strong showing as a reason for the Federal Reserve to move quickly as it starts to raise interest rates this year. The Fed has already cited the strong job market as a reason for it to shift its focus to fighting inflation and made clear that its path would be determined by the economic data.\nStocks have had a volatile start to the year as traders prepare for those rate increases. As inflation climbs quickly, investors are questioning how fast and how high rates will rise. The first increase could come as soon as next month, policymakers signaled in late January.\n\u201cThe report underscores an incredibly strong economy,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, the chief U.S. economist at S&P Global. \u201cThe Fed now is on solid ground, and we think they will raise rates six times in 2022. This is just one more reason for the Fed to continue to tighten policy this year.\u201d\nThe reaction was most evident in the bond market, where yields on government bonds jumped after the report. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.93 percent from 1.82 percent, while those on two-year notes jumped to 1.31 percent, the highest since February 2020.\nShares of Amazon jumped 13.5 percent after the company said on Thursday that its revenue rose to a record $137.4 billion in the final three months of last year. Amazon also announced that it would raise the annual price of its Prime shipping club for the first time since 2018 to $139, from $119.\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, fell about 0.3 percent on Friday, a day after it plunged more than 26 percent. Meta dropped on Thursday after it said that Facebook had lost users and that a privacy change by Apple last year would cost it advertising dollars this year.\nOther social media stocks fared better on Friday, rebounding from a drop the day before. Snap jumped 58.8 percent, rebounding from a more than 23 percent loss on Thursday, after the company reported its first quarter of profits, earning $22.5 million in the last three months of 2021. Twitter, which reports its earnings next week, climbed 7.2 percent.\nShares of large banks also edged higher after the jobs report gave investors more certainty about the prospects of interest rate increases. Lenders stand to reap higher profits as interest rates on loans rise, and Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup were all higher.\nOil markets rallied on Friday as awinter stormdisruptedproduction in Texas. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, settled above $92 a barrel. Shares of energy companies climbed as well. Occidental Petroleum and Exxon Mobil each rose about 2 percent.\nInvestors will be laser-focused next week on fresh inflation data. On Thursday, the Labor Department will publish its gauge of consumer prices for January. The Consumer Price Index rose at the fastest rate since 1982 in December.\nMore major companies, including Disney and Coca-Cola, will report their financial performance for the last three months of 2021. So far, just over half the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their quarterly earnings reports, with 76 percent of those beating estimates, according to data compiled by FactSet.\n"

        "title": "Grindr is pulled from Apple\u2019s App Store in China.",
        "fulltext": "Executives with Grindr, the world\u2019s most popular gay dating app, have pulled it from Apple\u2019s App Store in China over concerns about data regulations, the latest in a series of foreign departures from the Chinese market following new rules.\nGrindr\u2019s services continue to function in China, although in the past China\u2019s government has taken steps to block services that do not follow its rules. In this case, the rules include a new personal information protection law that requires Chinese government permission for customer data to be transmitted outside the country\u2019s borders.\nWith headquarters in West Hollywood, Calif., the app pioneered location-based dating. Grindr has occasionally gotten into hot water over its handling of personal data. In 2018 the social network, which is aimed at gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people, faced widespread criticism for sharing users\u2019 H.I.V. status, sexual tastes and other intimate details with outside software vendors.\nThe Chinese internet is one of the most difficult operating environments for foreign companies in the world, with state-dictated censorship and disclosure rules that can force companies to hand over consumer data.\nRecent laws in China designed to protect consumer data have made things even more difficult for foreign firms, which must seek state permission to transmit data outside the country. State policing of the internet has also increased in recent weeks, as Beijing prepares for the Winter Olympics, which start on Friday.\nGrindr moved to pull the app last week because of difficulties complying with the new regulations, said a company official who declined to be named. Over the past year, many of the few foreign internet firms still operating in China have taken similar steps. In October, LinkedIn said it wouldclose its China site, citing a challenging operating environment. Shortly after, Yahoo followed suit.\nLike many major internet services, Grindr has found itself caught between the United States and China. The American government forced Grindr\u2019s previous Chinese owner to sell the company in 2020 over national security concerns about sensitive data the company possessed."

        "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Glitchy, Snaggy Social Media Rollout",
        "fulltext": "Donald Trump\u2019s out with his new app, Truth Social, and, to describe it in a few words, it\u2019s more of an antisocial network.\nAt least that\u2019s the story so far about the former president\u2019s foray into tech via a sketchy investment vehicle, created by sketchy techies (who hide their names), run by executives whose supposed expertise in running such complex organizations is, you guessed it, sketchy.\nWell, I guess it\u2019s par for the course for any number of entrepreneurial efforts by golf-enthusiast Trump \u2014 from steaks to universities to bottled water \u2014 many of which have flamed out after much-touted rollouts. What\u2019s special here is that the flameout has been the rollout.\nThe myriad glitches in Truth Social\u2019s sign-up process when it said it was open for business on Monday \u2014 not coincidentally Presidents\u2019 Day \u2014 are well documented. And to be fair, much of what happened is not altogether unusual for a new app with a lot of hype around it. But with Truth Social, it managed to be that and much, much more. Every step of the process, at least for me (and seemingly everyone on that other social media site), was a series of error messages, from the download to the sign-in, to the ability to recover a password, as I was running it through its paces.\nThat\u2019s the reason I used my backup burner phone for the process, since it\u2019s not connected with my personal digital life and works only on Wi-Fi. It\u2019s the same process I used to download TikTok, due to its Chinese ownership, which Iwrote about in 2020. My concerns for each are the same: 1. Possible security issues; 2. Possible privacy issues; 3. Likely invasive marketing schemes; and 4. Anything this cloaked in secrecy just gives me the willies. Truth Social inspires the same feeling I have about Facebook and, to a lesser extent, Google: I simply don\u2019t trust it as a business that will protect its own consumers.\nThewait listaspect \u2014 it seems most people can\u2019t even use the service \u2014 was particularly odd. First, I was informed that though they \u201cloved\u201d me, I was number 249,495 in line. Then, I mysteriously rose to 169,495 before, poof!, I was back at 249,495. Whether it was actually a marketing gambit to give the appearance of popularity or was simply technological incompetence, it was a flashing red signal of the kind of high jinks I feared would come from Trump\u2019s people. While one might assume the Apple folks gave it a good once over before allowing it to be in the App Store \u2014 where it is now the No. 1 free download in the US, ahead of big names like TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook \u2014 I remain in \u201cbuyer beware\u201d mode. Better safe than sorry with the data hungry, which is why I usedslightlyinaccurate personal information.\nTruth Social execs said it will all be fixed by the end of March, but we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any truth in that advertising.\nAlso weird: Someone had already taken @karaswisher, which is an uncommon name. Why? Who knows! Perhaps Truth Social is setting it aside for me \u2014 as the competing conservative social media app Gettr did \u2014 or perhaps Laura Ingraham is cosplaying me.\nAll kidding aside, the real test will be when the service has been running for a bit, apparently in April, when users can kick the tires. The sign-up process is one thing, but keeping users consistently engaged and posting quality content is another thing entirely. Photos I\u2019ve seen suggest Truth Social is effectively a Twitter clone with, in some ways, even stricter moderation rules (so much for free speech!). There don\u2019t seem to be any special innovations beyond a marketing slogan of being \u201cAmerica\u2019s \u2018Big Tent\u2019 social media platform that encourages an open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology.\u201d\nLofty. But like anything else, only fresh features and the buzz they create can make it a successful platform, since the excitement of round-the-clock trolling by the former president is sure to wear off. I\u2019ve seen it before, to be a winner in tech requires more than providing a stage for bloviating, endless scream fests and stunt posting. You\u2019ve got to get busy being either useful, entertaining or unique \u2014 and being all three is the golden goal.\nTruth Social is already playing catch-up in the right-leaning social media behind Gettr, Rumble, Parler, MeWe and others. So it had better get better, fast. That\u2019s hardly a given here, even with Trump\u2019s backing, since they are all fighting for a relatively small pool of consumers. (I mean, there is only so muchDinesh D\u2019Souza nonsenseto go around.)\nWall Street, however, didn\u2019t seem to mind the mess. Digital World Acquisition, the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, that Trump Media is set to merge with, saw its shares up 14 percent after the Truth Social debut. This, despite an ongoing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission that could stop the SPAC transaction and deny Trump Media access to some $1.3 billion in cash.\nBut let\u2019s face it, Trump clearly still pines for Twitter, his greatest digital love, a relationship that is now unrequited. While he has been tweet-banished, I would lay good money down on a bet that he would run right back to his old stomping ground \u2014 emphasis on stomp \u2014 if he were given the opportunity, leaving Truth Social without a backward glance.\nThis week I caught up with Liza Donnelly, whose new book \u201cVery Funny Ladies,\u201d about women cartoonists for The New Yorker, will be published next month. But rather than my tried-and-true question and answer format, I asked Donnelly, herself a cartoonist, to lean into her sketching talents and answer my queries with her drafting pen. No editing needed this week.\nYour book is titled \u201cVery Funny Ladies,\u201d which they are. But I would love to know why we need to differentiate women and men when it comes to cartooning, since it does not, say, require a feat of physical strength to pick up a pen or pencil. In other words, what are the unique challenges women face in cartooning?\nIt feels like a much less funny world now, but maybe that\u2019s just me. What has changed in cartooning for you and how you conceive of your work?\nI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask how the shift to digital has impacted your craft, not only in how you make what you make. Is it easier for people to break through? Is there a creator community as there is on TikTok and Instagram?\nWhat do you imagine cartooning will be like in the metaverse, since everyone kind of looks like a cartoon version of themselves? Is there anything you have seen that strikes you as good? Bad?\nLovely: Apple\u2019s TV division deserves kudos for the new series from Ben Stiller\u2019s production company called \u201cSeverance.\u201d Its plot is all sci-fi and dystopian tech, in which corporate employees have their brains \u201csevered,\u201d bifurcating work and personal lives so their knowledge and memories of their workplace are unavailable to them after they clock out. There is so much going on in this show \u2014 including its stellar cast \u2014 which is visually sterile and hints at a real-life metaverse in which workers are imprisoned by choice, in part to avoid thinking about the consequences of some very dastardly work they are doing and to forget their various turmoils at home for eight ignorant hours. It\u2019s also full of video surveillance nightmares that cast tech in a less than flattering light. As we rethink our post-pandemic relationship to work and try to figure out how to be less isolated as we grow more separated, this is a must watch. Don\u2019t miss the indignity of the melon buffet.\nLoathsome:If you don\u2019t think there is a bright line between the increasingly hateful rhetoric by the right wing against the trans and L.G.B.T.Q. communities, and, led by Trump, the strident and bizarre-even-for-them support of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin \u2014 then you aren\u2019t paying attention online. There, this perpetually aggrieved gang have attempted to link at-home hot-button issues like cancel culture and gender concerns with the fact that Putin himself has not done these things. That\u2019s right, he did not takeyourparking space, so lay off! It\u2019s a specious and mystifying, but, ultimately, effective technique now on continuous loop on the usual digital platforms. A particularly loathsome version wason displayin a recent exchange between uber-conservative operatives Steve Bannon and Erik Prince on Bannon\u2019s \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast available on Apple and other platforms, after being pulled from some, such as YouTube. Like the Omicron variant, these fetid messages spread with virulence among the mentally unvaccinated to gin up base rage. These people never went away the last time they tried to spew such hatred, but now they have better tech weapons and a lot more power to reach people. Stopping such rhetoric is not the point \u2014 it\u2019s far too late for that. But it is essential that we understand how such antipathy grows and latches on to other memes online, like anti-vaccine campaigns and election fraud lies. That\u2019s especially true if you are one of the main distributors of the content and, for instance, a gay C.E.O. of the most valuable and powerful tech company in the world like, say, Tim Cook."
