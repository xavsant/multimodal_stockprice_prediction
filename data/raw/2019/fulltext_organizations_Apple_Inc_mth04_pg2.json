        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Fire your agents.\nThat was the instruction the Writers Guild of America gave to its 13,000 members on Friday, after talks between theHollywoodwriters and their agents broke down hours before a midnight deadline.\nThe sudden end to negotiations upended a way of doing business that had been in place for more than four decades.\nThe fight had been brewing for a year. The Writers Guild of America\u2019s Los Angeles and New York branches accused the agents of enriching themselves at their clients\u2019 expense and demanded that they agree to anew code of conduct.\nIf the agents believed that the movie and television writers\u2019threat to break the bond between themwas a mere negotiating ploy, they learned it was a genuine stance when the talks fizzled out late Friday afternoon. The Association of Talent Agents, the group representing the major agencies, offered concessions in recent days, but their efforts were not enough to keep the two sides at the table.\nIn an email blast sent to its members at the end of the failed talks, the Writers Guild of America said, \u201cThere is no settlement.\u201d\n\u201cWe know that, together, we are about to enter uncharted waters,\u201d the board of the two affiliated unions wrote. \u201cLife that deviates from the current system might be various degrees of disorienting. But it has become clear that a big change is necessary.\u201d\n[Writers and agents were once so close.TV\u2019s new golden age has changed that.]\nThe unions instructed members to sign a form letter that will allow them to fire their agents individually. \u201cThe Guild will forward all letters en masse to the appropriate agencies in a few days,\u201d the unions said.\nThe Association of Talent Agents said in a statement released at the end of talks that the planned mass firing \u201cwill hurt all artists, delivering an especially painful blow to midlevel and emerging writers.\u201d\nThe statement continued: \u201cThe W.G.A. leadership today declared a pathway for compromise doesn\u2019t exist. Agencies have been committed to reaching an agreement with the W.G.A., but, despite our best efforts, today\u2019s outcome was driven by the Guild\u2019s predetermined course for chaos.\u201d\nThe TV writers and agents had been operating under a franchise agreement that took effect in 1976. That agreement was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, when the Writers Guild of America would technically break ties with every agency that had not signed the new code of conduct.\nThe four major agencies \u2014 William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners \u2014 had been steadfast in shunning the writers\u2019 attempt to make serious changes to the structure that has long been in place.\nThe fight made for an unusual labor battle. The writers\u2019 unions, whichwent on strike in 2007andnearly did so again two years ago, have traditionally had disputes with their bosses at the big studios. This time, they have directed their fury with the people who have served as their advocates and friends.\nDuring a programming boom often referred to as Peak TV \u2014 495 shows were available in the United States last year, thanks in part to the rise of streaming \u2014 television writers have claimed that their pay is stagnant or going down. The writers blame what they perceive as insufficient compensation on the agencies, accusing them of corrupt business practices.\nTwo specific practices have gnawed at television writers. One is the agents\u2019 decades-old habit of packaging a roster of talent from their pool of clients for a given project. In return, the agencies waive the usual 10 percent commission fee paid to them by individual clients and collect large sums, called packaging fees, from the studios. The writers claim that these deals allow the agents to effectively pocket money that should be theirs.\nThe writers\u2019 second complaint concerns how three of the major agencies \u2014 William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists and the United Talent \u2014 have ventured into the production business with the creation of affiliated companies that produce and own content. This development, the writers say, can mean that agents sit across the table from executives who are essentially their colleagues in what the unions call a conflict of interest.\nThe agencies have called the writers\u2019 claims preposterous, arguing that their services are needed more than ever in a changing media environment in which Netflix, Amazon and Apple are on the rise.\nThe writers have been adamant that the agencies must end the practices they find objectionable, which the code of conduct would accomplish. Last month, 7,882 members of the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East voted in favor of the new code of conduct, with just 392 members voting nay.\nThe rupture between the writers and their agents will introduce disorder to Hollywood. The industry is approaching the so-called staffing season, when the broadcast networks assemble their fall lineups and hire writers to bang out telescripts for sitcoms and police procedurals. Agents are the usual go-betweens for the writers and studios, taking a strong hand in matching writers rooms with the appropriate writers.\nUnion bosses have in recent days told writers that they would be able to apply for jobs through a web portal set up by the Writers Guild of America, or by empowering their managers or lawyers to make deals on their behalf.\nThe agents have warned the writers against allowing managers or lawyers to do that kind of work.\nOn Friday morning, Latham & Watkins, a law firm representing the talent agents, sent a letter to the union, saying it was \u201cunlawful\u201d in California and New York for managers and lawyers to take on the role of agents. The note also suggested that litigation could soon be filed in both directions.\nThere were hints of the coming impasse on Thursday evening after the Association of Talent Agents went public with its counterproposals to the writers. Some people in Hollywood interpreted the association\u2019s unusual step of revealing what had been happening during closed-door negotiations as a sign that the two sides were nowhere near a deal.\nWith their counterproposals on Thursday, the agencies suggested that they wanted to continue with packaging and running their own affiliated production programs, but they were willing to make their practices more transparent.\nFor shows with packaging arrangements, the agencies said they would share \u201ca percentage\u201d of their back-end profits with writers. More specifically, the agents said 80 percent of that share would be funneled toward writers who did not participate in profits on the series. The remaining 20 percent would go toward initiatives meant to improve diversity in writers\u2019 rooms.\nOn the production affiliate programs, the agents vowed to be more transparent and to meet with writers four times a year to discuss whether a show made with agencies\u2019 sibling companies was \u201cbenefiting writers.\u201d After two years, according to the counterproposal, if the unions continued to believe that writers were not doing well under the arrangement, they would have the right to reopen negotiations on the matter.\nThe writers unions found both offers unsatisfactory. David Goodman, the president of the West branch,said that the revisedpackaging offer was \u201cnot a serious proposal\u201d and that the production affiliate offer was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nMany bystanders \u2014 studio executives and producers \u2014 have likened the writers\u2019 strategy to Brexit: unyielding, but where will it lead?\n\u201cWe will not only stand together, we will stand up for each other, lean on each other,\u201d the unions said on Friday. \u201cWe can do this.\u201d"
