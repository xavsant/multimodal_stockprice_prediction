Blame Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” (2011), as the authors do, for the public perception that Mr. Jobs never outgrew the managerial style of the scheming, screaming, cheating, smelly hothead he may — may — have been in his early years. Instead, Mr. Schlender and Mr. Tetzeli say in their new book, Mr. Jobs developed a wise, mature, deliberate executive style for which he is seldom given credit, one that helped lead Apple to glorious heights.   \n",

Blame Walter Isaacson’s “Steve Jobs” (2011), as the authors do, for the public perception that Mr. Jobs never outgrew the managerial style of the scheming, screaming, cheating, smelly hothead he may — may — have been in his early years. Instead, Mr. Schlender and Mr. Tetzeli say in their new book, Mr. Jobs developed a wise, mature, deliberate executive style for which he is seldom given credit, one that helped lead Apple to glorious heights.\n",
