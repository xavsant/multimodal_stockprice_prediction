        "title": "Volkswagen, Hit by Emissions Scandal, Posts Its First Loss in Years",
        "fulltext": "FRANKFURT \u2014 A remarkable period of growth ended atVolkswagenon Wednesday when the carmaker reported its first quarterly loss in at least 15 years and began the costly process of absorbing the expense of fixing millions of cars designed to cheat on emissions tests.\nThe day also was the end of a defining era of Volkswagen ambition. Matthias M\u00fcller, the new chief executive, signaled that the company would no longer be focused on becoming the world\u2019s largest carmaker.\nHe said on Wednesday that sales would cease to be an overriding measure of success. In another shift, he also said that top executives at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany, who had been criticized for micromanaging, would no longer get involved in details of product design.\nMr. M\u00fcller\u2019s statement represents a clear break from his predecessor, Martin Winterkorn, who resigned in late September after the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States disclosed that Volkswagen diesel cars were equipped with software that could detect when a car was being tested and crank up pollution controls.\nAfter he became chief executive in 2007, Mr. Winterkorn declared his determination to make Volkswagen the world\u2019s largest carmaker, overtaking Toyota. He was known for his intense attention to the technical fine points of the vehicles the company produced.\n\u201cA lot of things were subordinated to the desire to be faster, higher, larger,\u201d Mr. M\u00fcller said in a conference call with analysts and reporters on Wednesday. He also said, \u201cI have no intention of intervening in the details of product design.\u201d\nMr. Winterkorn\u2019s management style, coupled with a relentless drive for growth, is cited by some critics of the company as a contributing factor to the scandal by impeding open communication and perhaps causing subordinates to cheat rather than admit failure.\nThe earnings report on Wednesday provided a first taste of the financial cost to Volkswagen of its past behavior. The company said it had a net loss of $1.84 billion in the third quarter as it set aside a huge sum to help cover the expected damage from the company\u2019s emissions-cheating scandal.\nIt was the first quarterly loss in as long as anyone could remember. A company spokesman said that internal records went back only to 2001. Previously, Volkswagen did not report quarterly earnings. The loss, totaling 1.67 billion euros, was in contrast to a profit of \u20ac2.97 billion in the third quarter of 2014.\nVolkswagen subtracted \u20ac6.7 billion from profit to cover the expense of recalling and repairing about nine million cars in Europe and the United Statesequipped with the illegal software.\nThat sum does not cover the cost of fines Volkswagen is likely to have to pay to the E.P.A. and to other authorities around the world. Volkswagen also faces hundreds of lawsuits from customers who say the company sold them cars based on a false promise.\n\u201cIt is still far too early to calculate the cost of legal measures,\u201d Frank Witter, the chief financial officer, said in the conference call on Wednesday.\nThe company said it expected profit for full-year 2015 \u201cto be down significantly\u201d from 2014. Volkswagen shares rose on Wednesday, but the stock is down more than 20 percent since the emissions cheating became known on Sept. 18.\nDuring tests, the Volkswagen diesel engines with illegal software make full use of pollution controls and can pass emissions tests. But during regular operation, the engines emit many times the allowed amount of nitrogen oxide.\nBecause the deception became known less than two weeks before the end of the most recent reporting period, the third-quarter results provide only a glimpse of the fallout. Volkswagen executives said on Wednesday that they had not seen any signs that the damage to the company\u2019s reputation from the scandal had kept buyers away from showrooms. But they added they were closely watching for possible negative effects in the months to come.\nVolkswagen said it had an operating loss of \u20ac3.5 billion in the quarter, compared with an operating profit of \u20ac3.2 billion a year earlier. The loss was partly offset by \u20ac1.5 billion in profit the company received for selling its nearly 20 percent stake in the Japanese vehicle maker Suzuki in September.\nSales in the quarter rose 5.3 percent to \u20ac51.5 billion, Volkswagen said, largely because of gains by its Audi, Bentley and Porsche divisions and favorable currency movements. However, the number of vehicles sold slipped to 2.35 million in the quarter from 2.44 million a year earlier.\nVolkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.\nThe recent sales data showed that Volkswagen was vulnerable even before the scandal. Sales have been slumping in China, the company\u2019s largest market, and other important markets like Brazil, which is in a severe recession.\nShortly after the conference call Wednesday, Mr. M\u00fcller joined Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on a trip to China. He was expected to brief her on Volkswagen\u2019s response to the scandal.\nVolkswagen this year briefly surpassed Toyota in the number of cars produced, but has since slipped back to No. 2. Mr. M\u00fcller said that while size was important \u2014 it allowed car companies to spread costs of development over more vehicles \u2014 Volkswagen would put more emphasis on factors like customer satisfaction and profitability.\n\u201cThe point is not whether we sell 100,000 more or less than a major competitor,\u201d he said.\nMr. M\u00fcller said that Volkswagen was conducting its own investigation of how the emissions cheating occurred, but provided no new details on the progress of the inquiry. \u201cWe need to find out the truth and learn from it,\u201d he said.\nVolkswagen had advertised that its \u201cclean diesel\u201d motors were environmentally responsible while delivering excellent fuel economy and performance. But the deceptive software made that economy and performance possible only by allowing the engines to emit up to 40 times the allowable limit of nitrogen oxide, an air pollutant that can be harmful to lungs.\nThe German government has ordered Volkswagen to recall 8.5 million vehicles in Europe with the software, and the company has said it will repair an additional 500,000 in the United States at no cost to customers. But it remains unclear how the company can make the cars compliant with air quality regulations without also hurting performance and fuel economy.\nAny fix that hurts the cars\u2019 resale value will provide ammunition to disgruntled customers and their lawyers.\nMr. M\u00fcller has raised the possibility of job cuts because of the cost of the scandal and has said Volkswagen will cut spending on new projects. The company employs 614,000 people worldwide.\nAnalysts say that Volkswagen, which said on Wednesday it had \u20ac28 billion in cash on hand, can probably absorb the financial blow of the scandal. But spending on crucial new technologies like self-driving cars could suffer at a time when the industry faces potential new competition from Google andApple. Both companies have been working on car-related projects.\n\u201cThe financial burden from the diesel crisis is enormous but manageable,\u201d Mr. Witter, the chief financial officer, said."

        "fulltext": "FRANK BRUNI:As Op-Ed columnists venturing boldly \u2014 or maybe I should say indulgently \u2014 into the world of movies, Ross, you and I sometimes labor to draw connections between politics and\n                                        Hollywood.\nThis time around, no such huffing and puffing are necessary, because the fall is upon us, and that\u2019s when the most ambitious and topical fare comes out, in preparation for awards season. One of the new releases\n                                        this past weekend, \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d focuses on nothing less somber than child soldiers in war-torn African\n                                        countries.\nWe\u2019re a long way from the dippy rom-coms of summer.\nLet\u2019s begin on Mars, where Matt Damon is creating his own private Idaho and tilling spuds to stave off starvation. I\u2019m describing the first stretch of \u201cThe Martian,\u201d\n                                        a movie that I experienced not just as thrilling entertainment but as a sort of corrective for the presidential campaign and our sour national mood.\nIf I didn\u2019t know how long it takes a movie to gestate, I\u2019d think that \u201cThe Martian,\u201d directed by Ridley Scott, had been ordered up in response tothe pessimismespoused by Republican candidates in particular.\nDonald Trump keeps telling us what losers we\u2019ve become. His rivals are less blunt but equally gloomy.\nROSS DOUTHAT:Hey, wait \u2014 isn\u2019t the whole point of Trump\u2019s campaign that wecanmake America great again, that we can start doing the big things that we once\n                                        took for granted (winning wars, launching manned space missions, building white-elephant casinos in Atlantic City \u2026 well, O.K., maybe just the first two) if we have only the wisdom and courage to elect the\n                                        Donald as our leader? Obviously \u201cThe Martian\u201d is set near the end of President Trump\u2019s second (or maybe third?) term, after all earthbound enemies (the Islamic State, the Chinese, the Mexican\n                                        government) have been vanquished, and we\u2019re ready to look heavenward again.\nBRUNI:Did I hear that right:Two terms of Trump?!?I don\u2019t think I \u2014 or the country \u2014 could survive that, and a movie set in such circumstances would look more like\n                                        \u201cI Am Legend\u201d or \u201cThe Road,\u201d by which I mean post-apocalyptic. In any case, my point is that the dire voices of Trump and his Republican rivals reflect an electorate in which parents\n                                        don\u2019t foresee a better life for their children and a significant majority of people think that America is onthe wrong track.\n\u201cThe Martian,\u201d in contrast, is a paean to American ingenuity, resilience and speed. In real life, we can\u2019t manage to repair bridges or upgrade our infrastructure despite decades of justifiable angst\n                                        about it. In Scott\u2019s fantasy, we assemble sophisticated rockets in what seems like one sleepless, industrious week.\nDOUTHAT:Wasn\u2019t it George W. Bush who last proposed a Mars mission?\nBRUNI:That was before Republicans became as fond of pooh-poohing science as they are now. In Scott\u2019s fantasy, science saves the day. Bitter international rivalries crumble. And there\u2019s\n                                        a seamless integration of races and sexes. The brainy whiz kid with the eureka solution is black. The leader of a crew of astronauts is a woman.\nDOUTHAT:All political kidding aside, I think I\u2019m in the minority in being slightly disappointed with Ridley Scott\u2019s Mars movie. I loved the first third, when it\u2019s all Matt Damon\n                                        manifesting all-American ingenuity on Mars, and I liked the second third well enough, when the action moves to the multiracial band of NASA engineers and whiz kids. But then the movie started to actively bore me\n                                        just when it should have been moving to its climax: The crew that turned back to rescue Damon\u2019s astronaut was basically a human-interest-free zone (notwithstanding the fine actors playing them), and everything\n                                        that happened along the way to the rescue felt predictable and even a little bit mailed-in.\nI appreciated that the movie didn\u2019t weigh Damon\u2019s character down with tearjerking personal baggage when it was just him mucking about cheerfully on Mars. But once we were supposed to become deeply invested\n                                        in his rescue, I found myself pining for the primal emotional manipulations of \u201cApollo 13\u201d\u00a0or \u201cGravity\u201d \u2014 or maybe I just wanted him to stay on Mars, to see exactly how long\n                                        he could actually hold out.\nBRUNI:You can have your \u201cprimal emotional manipulations.\u201d Give me vintage disco music! \u201cThe Martian\u201d blares Gloria Gaynor across the galaxy, presenting\u00a0science fiction\n                                        you can dance to. Take comfort, Ross.Wewillsurvive.\nDOUTHAT:With all that said, I vastly preferred the way \u201cThe Martian\u201d approached American creativity than the approach Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle took with their vision of Apple\u2019s\n                                        presiding genius in \u201cSteve Jobs.\u201d What did you think of Sorkin\u2019s latest interpretation\n                                        of our Silicon Valley overlords?\nBRUNI:It left me somewhat cold. I mean, I like the snap-crackle-pop of Sorkin dialogue as much as the next guy, and \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is lousy with great actors, even if several of them (I\u2019m\n                                        thinking of Kate Winslet in particular) have been assigned notions rather than characters.\nDOUTHAT:Notions, in Winslet\u2019s case, whose Polish accent slips in and out from scene to scene and time period to time period: She seemed to get more Polish between 1984 and 1998.\nBRUNI:I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen a movie thatwasn\u2019tbased on a play yet gives the impression of being an adaptation of one.\nDOUTHAT:I agree: Sorkin basically wrote a three-act play, and maybe the movie\u2019s artifice would work better in the more artificial setting of a theater.\nBRUNI:\u201cSteve Jobs\u201d is claustrophobic, schematic, mannered, forced. I know its peculiar structure and scope are meant to feel daring, but that structure and scope are ultimately pressed\n                                        into something a bit predictable and hokey: Jobs the visionary can\u2019t savor his greatest triumph until Jobs the reluctant father reconnects with his soul, and vice versa.\nDOUTHAT:In a film that at least pretends to realism, the sheer absurdity of the premise \u2014 that 30 minutes before a major project launch Steve Jobs would let himself be assailed and harangued\n                                        by friends, exes, bosses, children, and that the exact same group would show up to harangue him at two subsequent launches, years and decades later \u2014\u00a0wore me down, and quickly. (The fact that the characters\n                                        had to keep acknowledging how absurd it was didn\u2019t really help.)\nThe irony is that the movie is probably technically truer to the real Jobs (even if Michael Fassbender never quite channeled his hippie/Zen side effectively) than \u201cThe Social Network\u201d was to Mark Zuckerberg:\n                                        The Facebook honcho isn\u2019t really the status-obsessed, sexually frustrated monster of the meritocracy that Sorkin\u2019s script made him out to be, whereas Jobs was really was an impossible perfectionist\n                                        who treated the people around him terribly.\nBut the fake Zuckerberg worked as a character; he had an internal logic, a set of motivations all-too-recognizable to anyone who\u2019s survived the Ivy League. Whereas the real Jobs, in this movie, is trapped in\n                                        airless set pieces and saddled with a totally unconvincing character arc.Only by becoming a better dad, a better man, could he become the man who gave us the iPhone \u2026It\u2019s a moral that feels\n                                        as fake as the movie\u2019s entire three-act conceit.\nBRUNI:That said, there\u2019s an aspect of \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d beyond the fleet, nimble dialogue and energetic performances that interests me, and that\u00a0is its clear, vivid reminder that\n                                        Jobs wasn\u2019t an inventor, with blazing scientific epiphanies, so much as a marketer, with a maniacal focus on packaging, messaging, timing, style. Is America\u2019s greatest talent the same as his great\n                                        talent? And, in that sense, is he as iconic and definitive an American character as any other?\nDOUTHAT:I always saw Jobs\u00a0primarily as an aesthete, elevating an entire industry with his perfectionism, andselling the futureby making it seem beautiful again. But of course you\u2019re right that the \u201cselling\u201d was as crucial as the tastemaking: His genius wasn\u2019t just in seeing that aesthetics mattered in computing;\n                                        it was persuading everyone else to pay, and pay a premium, for the privilege of enjoying them.\nAnd speaking of interesting aesthetics, what did you think of \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d a movie that takes us about as far from a Silicon Valley product launch as it\u2019s possible to go? (Without going\n                                        to Mars, that is.)\nBRUNI:There\u2019s a scene in \u201cBeasts\u201d as gripping and devastating as any that has appeared or will appear in any movie this year, and it chills me even now, as I remember it. An African\n                                        boy who has been separated from his family, utterly abandoned and swept up into a roving militia that\u2019s his only hope for survival is instructed to show his fidelity and kill. He\u2019s given a machete.\n                                        He\u2019s told how best to lower it, hard and swift, on the head of a man kneeling before him. The man trembles, weeps, begs. And in the interminable seconds \u2014 which feel like hours \u2014 before we,\n                                        in the audience, see what happens, there\u2019s the possibility that innocence can withstand corruption, that evil can be kept at bay.\nBut here\u2019s the thing about those seconds: You know they\u2019re coming. You can telegraph the entirety of \u201cBeasts\u201d from its beginning. It has shocks but no real surprises, and the insights it\n                                        provides into how violence begets violence, how tribalism blinds people to their common humanity, how thoroughly power intoxicates and how completely someone can objectify his or her enemies aren\u2019t really\n                                        insights: They\u2019re what you already sense and expect.\nDOUTHAT:I wanted to love \u201cBeasts.\u201d It\u2019s (obviously) worthy subject matter. It\u2019s made byCary Fukunaga, whose absence from\n                                        the second season of \u201cTrue Detective\u201d revealed just how much his talents made the first. It\u2019s Netflix\u2019s first attempt at a feature film, and more companies making films \u2014 especially\n                                        non-superhero films! \u2014 is always good. It stars the great Stringer Bell \u2014 I mean, the greatIdris Elba. It starts out beautifully, in verdant domesticity\n                                        tinged with mortal dread.\nBut I agree: Past a certain point, its story just became a catalog of horrors, one nightmarish scene after another, crushing you with the human misery involved but never quite finding the thread of a compelling story.\nBRUNI:\u201cBeasts\u201d is a sometimes vivid illustration of the horrors that fill news stories, but it doesn\u2019t dig deep enough to give you a truly fresh understanding of them. And\n                                        there are long stretches in which it doesn\u2019t really move forward or gather any additional force. Your stomach unclenches and your attention flags.\nDOUTHAT:This is a hard critique to offer, in a way, because of course many human situationsarejust a crushing sequence of horrors, and story is something imposed retrospectively, sometimes\n                                        artificially, sometimes in ways that are quite untrue to the experience. But story is also a way in, a way for people outside the horrors to make the imaginative leap into what they\u2019re witnessing. And I suppose\n                                        I wanted Fukunaga to give me more of that assistance.\nBRUNI:Even Idris Elba\u2019s initially riveting performance as the commander starts to fade in impact.\u00a0You will not find a bigger Idris fan than I. I\u2019d like to see him asthe next James Bond.\n                                        I\u2019d like to see him in six movies a year. And if he winds up in the best supporting actor hunt for this movie, as is currently predicted, great. But that\u2019s as much testament to the grimness and topicality\n                                        of the subject matter of \u201cBeasts\u201d as to its artfulness.\nDOUTHAT:I thought his\u00a0performance had all the terrifying charisma you could ask for. But I felt \u2014 strange as it sounds \u2014 like the script needed to make him a little bit moreappealing, so that the spell that he casts on his boy soldiers could extend a little more, if only for a few scenes, to the audience as well. He\u2019s just a little too unambiguously monstrous, which again\n                                        I\u2019m sure is true to life (the sexual abuse in particular), but which weakens the story\u2019s pull on us: We\u2019re watching his control over his boys be cemented and then come apart, and in the cementing\n                                        process I wanted to have more moments when I almost, in spite of myself, liked him. Or failing that I wanted a clearer glimpse of his own tortured humanity, somewhere beneath the monstrous surface.\nWithout it, \u201cBeasts of No Nation\u201d felt like an exercise in bearing witness: A good thing in its own right, but not enough to call the film a great work of art.\nBRUNI:It\u2019s Oscar bait through and through."

        "fulltext": "Madison Avenue may be the center of the advertising industry, but Silicon Valley is home to the most valuable brands.\nFor the third consecutive year,AppleandGoogletop the annual Interbrand Best Global Brands report.\nThe report, which is to be released on Monday, estimates the value of the Apple brand at $170.3 billion, up 43 percent from last year. The Google brand, at $120.3 billion, increased in value by 12 percent. (The value ofFacebook\u2019s brand, ranked No. 23, increased 54 percent to $22 billion, the highest percentage increase from last year\u2019s report.)\nAs data and technology continue to reshape advertising, the creative side of the business has been trying to keep pace. Changes in how ads are bought and sold \u2014 along with the ability to target consumers based on their preferences, behavior and other online data \u2014 have forced the advertising industry to re-examine marketing fundamentals, including branding.\nDuring the 12th annual Advertising Week conference last week in New York, there was a focus on the power of brands. One event, \u201cDo Brands Still Matter?\u201d \u2014 which featured leaders from Coca-Cola, Facebook and the agency Ogilvy and Mather \u2014 seemed in particular to underscore the creative industry\u2019s insecurity.\nJez Frampton, the global chief executive of Interbrand, says brands still matter.\n\u201cNowadays, in order to succeed in any marketplace, you not only have to have a great business idea, you have to have a great brand,\u201d Mr. Frampton said in a recent interview.\nThe technology industry dominated the Interbrand list this year, representing more than one-third of the report\u2019s overall value. Including No. 1 Apple and No. 2 Google, technology brands filled four of the report\u2019s top 10 spots.Microsoftclimbed a notch to No. 4, bumping IBM to No. 5; Samsung remained at No. 7. Interbrand classifies IBM as a business services brand, and Amazon, at No. 10, as a retail brand.\n\u201cAll the brands in the top are there for a very good reason,\u201d Mr. Frampton said. \u201cThey\u2019ve either transformed or made better how we live our lives.\u201d\nRounding out the top 10 were Coca-Cola, at No. 3; Toyota, at No. 6; General Electric, at No. 8; and McDonald\u2019s, at No. 9.\nInterbrand determines the rankings and brand valuations using factors that include how much revenue a company earns from a branded product, how big a role a brand plays in influencing its consumers\u2019 decisions and brand loyalty.\nOther notable brands on this year\u2019s list include the German automaker Volkswagen, which dropped to No. 35 from No. 31 and lost 9 percent of its value. Volkswagen recently admitted that it sold 11 million cars equipped with devices programmed to cheat on emissions tests. Its ranking reflects sentiment after the scandal.\nLenovo squeaked into the report for the first time, at No. 100, becoming the second Chinese brand to make the list after Huawei, a phone maker, appeared last year.\nOther new entrants include Lego, PayPal, Mini and the Champagne brand Mo\u00ebt & Chandon.\nPizza Hut, Gap, Nokia, Nintendo and Duracell fell out of the top 100."

        "title": "Chinese Hackers Breached LoopPay, Whose Tech Is Central to Samsung Pay",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Months before its technology became the centerpiece of Samsung\u2019s new mobile payment system, LoopPay, a small Massachusetts subsidiary of the South Korean electronics giant, was the target of a sophisticated attack by a group of government-affiliated Chinese hackers.\nAs early as March, the hackers \u2014 alternatively known as the Codoso Group or Sunshock Group by those who track them \u2014 had breached the computer network of LoopPay, a start-up in Burlington, Mass., that was acquired by Samsung in February for more than $250 million, according to several people briefed on the still-unfolding investigation, as well as Samsung and LoopPay executives.\nLoopPay executives said the Codoso hackers appeared to have been after the company\u2019s technology, known as magnetic secure transmission, or MST, which is a key part of the Samsung Pay mobile payment wallet that made its public debut in the United States last week.\nLike similar mobile payment systems from Apple and Google, Samsung Pay allows consumers to pay for goods using their Samsung smartphones with so-called near-field communications technology, which uses a wireless signal to send payment information from a phone to newer cash registers. But LoopPay\u2019s MST technology has an advantage: It also works with older payment systems by emulating a commonly used magnetic stripe card.\nThe attackers are believed to have broken into LoopPay\u2019s corporate network, but not the production system that helps manage payments, said Will Graylin, LoopPay\u2019s chief executive and co-general manager of Samsung Pay. Mr. Graylin said that security experts were still looking through LoopPay\u2019s systems, but that there had been no indication that the hackers infiltrated Samsung\u2019s systems or that consumer data had been exposed.\nFind out which parts of your identity may have been stolen in major hacking attacks over the last several years.\nLoopPay did not learn of the breach until late August, when an organization came across LoopPay\u2019s data while tracking the Codoso Group in a separate investigation.\nBoth LoopPay and Samsung executives said they were confident that they had removed infected machines, and that customer payment information and personal devices were not affected. They added that there was no need to delay the introduction of Samsung Pay, which had its debut in the United States last week after executing more than $30 million worth of purchases in South Korea.\n\u201cSamsung Pay was not impacted and at no point was any personal payment information at risk,\u201d Darlene Cedres, Samsung\u2019s chief privacy officer, said in a statement. \u201cThis was an isolated incident that targeted the LoopPay corporate network, which is a physically separate network. The LoopPay corporate network issue was resolved immediately and had nothing to do with Samsung Pay.\u201d\nBut two people briefed on the investigation, as well as security experts who have been tracking the Codoso hackers as they have targeted hundreds of victims around the world, said it would be premature to say what the hackers did and did not accomplish since they were discovered in August.\nTo start, the hackers were inside LoopPay\u2019s network for five months before they were discovered. And the Codoso Group is known for maintaining a hidden foothold in its victims\u2019 systems. Security experts say the group\u2019s modus operandi is to plant hidden back doors across victims\u2019 systems so that they continue to infiltrate their networks long after the initial breach.\nIn a multistage Codoso attack of Forbes in February, for example, the group infected the website of Forbes.com with malicious code that infected the site\u2019s visitors. But that was just the start. From there, other members of the group used that foothold in visitors\u2019 machines to search for valuable targets in the defense sector.\nAfter a similar attack by another Chinese state-affiliated hacking group on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in 2011, the chamber believed it had rid hackers from its network only to discover months later that an office printer and even a thermometer in one of its corporate apartments were still sending information back to computers in China.\nSamsung introduced Samsung Pay in the United States just 38 days after LoopPay learned it had been breached. On average, it takes 46 days before an attack by hackers can be fully resolved, according to the Ponemon Institute, a nonprofit that tracks breaches. But the time to fix the damage is typically much longer in cases of sophisticated Chinese hackings like the one at LoopPay.\n\u201cOnce Codoso compromises their targets \u2014 which range from dissidents to C-level executives in the U.S. \u2014 they tend to stay there for quite a long time, building out their access points so they can easily get back in,\u201d said John Hultquist, the head of intelligence on cyberespionage at iSight Partners, a security firm. \u201cThey\u2019ll come back to a previous organization of interest again and again.\u201d\nLoopPay hired two private forensics teams to investigate the breach on Aug. 21, just a month before it was set to bring Samsung Pay to the United States, according to Mr. Graylin. Both are still working the case.\nBut the investigation has been unusual from the start. LoopPay told the teams to look at different portions of its network. One of the firms, Sotoria, which is based in Charleston, S.C., was given a backup of LoopPay\u2019s data and asked to leave the company\u2019s headquarters after just three days.\nMr. Graylin said that was because the team was looking at LoopPay systems that he said fell outside the scope of the initial contract, in what Mr. Graylin described as an attempt to extract more fees. Even so, he said, LoopPay was still working with the company to resolve the breach.\nSotoria executives said they could not comment on the investigation. Mr. Graylin would not name the second computer forensics firm looking into the attack.\nLoopPay has not notified law enforcement about the breach, Mr. Graylin said, because his firm believed no customer data or financial information had been stolen.\nHe also played down concerns that hackers might try to use the information they stole about his company\u2019s technology in order to infiltrate Samsung Pay or create a copycat product. He said if such a thing emerged, LoopPay could file a patent lawsuit. What\u2019s more, he said, it would be viable only if major banks, credit card companies and carriers were willing to team up with the copycat.\nNews of the breach at LoopPay comes at a particularly inopportune time for Samsung, which is locked in a bitter war for smartphone supremacy against Apple and its immensely popular iPhone, as well as a newer crop of less expensive devices from manufacturers like China\u2019s Xiaomi."

        "title": "Microsoft\u2019s Rule-Breaking Vision of a Future With Countless Devices",
        "fulltext": "Close your eyes and imagine it\u2019s five years from now. Now, check your pockets and your desk. Which devices are you using?\nIt\u2019s very likely you have a smartphone. But is your second device an iPad-like tablet or a more traditional PC? Or perhaps you have a laptop-tablet hybrid, like Microsoft\u2019s Surface? Or maybe you don\u2019t own a second device, because your phone is powerful enough. Or you might have everything, because that\u2019s how you roll in our hypothetical future.\nO.K., open your eyes and get back to the present. If you had any trouble choosing, you have a taste of the dilemmas facingApple,Googleand Microsoft, the three players waging an epic battle for the future of computing.\nTechnology now allows for lots of powerful, compelling computing devices in a wide range of sizes and shapes. Just about everyone in the industry believes the smartphone will remain the dominant computing device for the foreseeable future. But second place looks entirely up for grabs, and the giants are jockeying to make that one other device that we\u2019ll all use along with our phones.\nApple has the iPad and the Mac, while Google has Android tablets and its Chromebook line of web-centric laptops.\nBut the most interesting new addition to the game is Microsoft,suddenly re-energizedafter suffering a long decline in the personal computer business.\nUnder Satya Nadella, who became Microsoft\u2019s chief executive early last year, Microsoft is embracing a fragmented vision of the future, in which no single device, or even a single category of devices, reigns supreme. The plan is a bit crazy and rife with internal and external tensions. That doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t work. The future is unpredictable, so why not try a bunch of good stuff and see what sticks?\nAta recent news conferencethat electrified not just Twitter but even some people in the real world, Microsoft wowed its loyalists (yes,there are Microsoft fanatics) with a number of new products that exemplify this idea. I\u2019ve been using two of them \u2014 theSurface Pro 4, a tablet-PC hybrid that starts at about $1,030 if you include a keyboard cover, and theSurface Book, a $1,500 laptop with a screen that can be jettisoned to become a tablet \u2014 for the better part of a week.\nOn the whole, I found them to be very nice. But is either one good enough to be that one other thing that most of us will want in a smartphone-dominated future?\nWell, that\u2019s the twist. The more I used Microsoft\u2019s new machines, the more I thought that perhaps no single kind of device is destined to win the war for second place to the smartphone. Perhaps the very idea that there will be a second-place winner is a mistake.\nWhat if the future of computing is chaos? We\u2019ll have smartphones and then a dizzying array of desktops, laptops, tablets and hybrid devices \u2014 and different people, for different reasons, will choose different sets of each.\nMicrosoft\u2019s devices \u2014 and in a larger sense, Mr. Nadella\u2019s strategy \u2014 anticipate such chaos. For much of its history, Microsoft was mainly a software company. It made Windows, the operating system that became the lingua franca of the PC era, and it made Office, the software that made those Windows machines useful to businesses.\nMicrosoft\u2019s new plan is to still make Windows and software for Windows, which it licenses to other hardware makers for their machines \u2014 but now it also makes its own phones and Surface devices, and it makes applications for iOS, Apple\u2019s mobile operating system.\nNo other company in the industry operates quite this expansively. Apple makes hardware and software, but just about all of its products are integrated; Apple\u2019s software works on Apple\u2019s hardware, and in most cases nowhere else.\nGoogle makes the Android and Chrome OS operating systems that it gives away free to other companies, and it also makes a handful of Nexus phones and tablets. But because it doesn\u2019t sell its devices for a profit and barely markets them, Google\u2019s hardware partners don\u2019t seem to mind its device business.\nThe modern Microsoft breaks all these rules: Its Surface devices compete with PCs made by other Windows hardware makers. Itsnon-Windows applications, like the iOS version of Office, improve the Apple devices that compete with Microsoft and its Windows hardware makers.\nYou could say Mr. Nadella is fostering competition between all of Microsoft\u2019s divisions. You could also say he\u2019s setting up the company as a circular firing squad. (Sure, Microsoft has long made Office for the Mac, so you can argue that iOS apps aren\u2019t such a big change, but it has been a long while since the Mac threatened Windows\u2019 hegemony, while iOS is arguably an existential problem for large parts of Microsoft\u2019s business.)\nAnother, perhaps deeper problem is the mixed messages Microsoft is sending to customers. Jan Dawson, an industry analyst, pointed out that when Microsoft released the Surface Pro 3 last year, it sold the device as a \u201cno-compromise\u201d tablet that doubled as a skinny, MacBook Air-like laptop. But with the Surface Book, Microsoft is now releasing a more traditional-looking laptop alongside the Surface Pro.\n\u201cIf the Surface Pro was a tablet that could replace your laptop, why would you need this laptop?\u201d Mr. Dawson asked.\nIf there are costs to Microsoft\u2019s do-everything strategy, there are also some potentially huge benefits. Microsoft could emerge as a dominant hardware maker, and perhaps uncover market niches that we didn\u2019t know existed.\nNote that the Surface started out shakily for Microsoft when the first version was released in 2012. At that time, many in the industry believed stand-alone tablets like the iPad would see indefinite growth. Microsoft was betting on an unusual middle path.\nIt took some time for the Surface to gain traction. But Microsoft kept working at the device and its software, and the incremental fixes began to reveal the fundamental utility of a tablet that could be used like a PC.\nThese improvements came as the sales of the iPad hit a wall. Perhaps the ultimate endorsement of Microsoft\u2019s strategy came this summer, when Apple unveiled the iPad Pro \u2014 a large-screen tablet with a keyboard and a stylus,just like the Surface.\nThe Surface Book, Microsoft\u2019s new laptop, could prove similarly influential. For one thing, it should spur Windows PC makers to do something they\u2019ve long neglected \u2014 make good products for a change.\nFor years, most PC makers have chased low prices by forgetting about user experience; they\u2019velarded their machines with preinstalled adware, failed tests of basic functionality (Windows trackpads were difficult to use) and abandoned customer service. That\u2019s why Apple dominates the high end of the PC business, and whyMac sales have grownas the rest of the PC business has declined.\nThe Surface Book, by contrast, is a genuinely fantastic machine \u2014 a light, fast, solid laptop with a dazzling display that, on the whole, feels every bit as thoughtfully crafted as anything bearing the bitten-Apple logo. Its trackpad is a pleasure to use, not a trudge.\nAnd while I\u2019m not sure that I need a laptop that can double as a tablet, the fact this one can do so effortlessly is a bonus. It is, at the least, a demonstration of Microsoft\u2019s hardware engineering prowess.\nThis suggests the ultimate goal of Microsoft\u2019s new devices: They spark excitement for Microsoft more generally. My wife, who is mostly indifferent to tech but trusts the Apple brand blindly, picked up the Surface Book the other day and was amazed at how good it was \u2014 and I was amazed at her amazement.\nThe path from such excitement to dominance is hardly guaranteed. Microsoft still lacks a compelling presence on mobile devices, and the best it can hope for is a kind of halo effect \u2014 that excitement for devices like the Surface Book and Office on iOS gets people to take a second look at Windows Phone.\nToday, that sounds like a stretch. But, hey, the future is wide open. Microsoft is taking the first necessary step to tackle that future: Making really great devices."

        "title": "Putting Mobile Ad Blockers to the Test",
        "fulltext": "To block ads or not to block ads on your mobile device? That\u2019s thephilosophical dilemma facing consumerssinceAppleadded support for ad blockers to itsiPhone operating systema couple of weeks ago.\nTo help answer the question, we decided to put multiple ad blockers to the test. Over the course of four days, we used several ad-blocking apps on our iPhones and measured how much the programs cut down on web page data sizes and improved loading times, and also how much they increased the smartphone\u2019s battery life.\nWe will get to the results in a minute, after a quick primer on the ethical debate surrounding ad blocking. While such technology has existed for years \u2014 it has long been available on PC browsers \u2014 ad blockers are new for iPhones and iPads. Using the blockers is easy: You download one of the programs from the App Store and then set your Safari web browser to enable the blocking. Ads are choked off inside the browser when you load mobile websites, but the blockers do not stop ads from appearing in apps.\nThe advantages of ad blocking seem obvious. Not only can consumers eliminate the clutter of promotions, but eradicating data-intensive ads could help deliver faster web page load times and longer battery lives for devices. Dean Murphy, who developed the ad-blocking app Crystal, said blocking programs might also encourage publishers to create better ads that are less taxing on mobile gadgets.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just to improve websites in general and the advertising issues,\u201d Mr. Murphy said of ad blockers. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about performance.\u201d\nBut media companies and many other sites are supported by online ads. So if you get rid of the promotions,you maykill publishers\u2019 business modelsand lose access to diverse content.\n\u201cIf the economic engine is threatened, how do small indie publishers and small local news publishers sustain their online content?\u201d Scott Cunningham, a general manager of the Interactive Advertising Bureau Tech Lab, said in an interview.\nLost in the debate is whether ad blockers truly benefit consumers\u2019 mobile devices in the first place. So we ran two specific tests on iPhones using three ad blockers:PurifyandCrystal, which are among the most downloaded ad blockers, and1Blocker, a less popular app.\nIn the first test, we recorded the data sizes of the 50 most popular news websites with and without ad blockers enabled. We used those figures to calculate approximate page load times on a 4G mobile network.\nIn the second test, which was designed to measure battery life, we compiled a customiPhoneapp to cycle through dozens of popular websites in an endless loop. We then timed how long it took the battery to completely drain from our phone with and without ads.\nThe results: For a number of websites that contained mobile ads with a lot of data, web page data sizes decreased significantly and load times accelerated enormously with ad blockers turned on. The iPhone\u2019s battery life also improved \u2014 but more modestly \u2014 with ads removed.\nMost of the data on the mobile homepages of the top 50 news websites comes from advertising, demonstrating the appeal of ad blockers.\nThe benefits of ad blockers stood out the most when loading theBoston.comwebsite. With ads, that home page on average measured 19.4 megabytes; with ads removed using Crystal or Purify, it measured four megabytes, and with 1Blocker, it measured 4.5 megabytes. On a 4G network, this translated to the page taking 39 seconds to load with ads and eight seconds to load without ads.\nIn another example, the home page of The Los Angeles Times measured 5.7 megabytes with ads. After shedding ads, that dropped to 1.6 megabytes with Crystal and 1.9 megabytes with Purify and 1Blocker. On a 4G network, the page took 11 seconds to load with ads and four seconds to load without ads.\nLoading times for The New York Times were also faster with ad blocking software. The home page of NYTimes.com measured 3.7 megabytes when loaded with ads and took seven seconds to load; Purify shaved the size down to 2.1 megabytes and cut the loading time to four seconds.\nOther websites had slighter reductions in web page data sizes or load times, partly because they used lighter-weight ads that were less data-intensive. For example, BuzzFeed.com measured 3.8 megabytes and took eight seconds to load with no ad blocker; with Crystal enabled, it measured 2.9 megabytes and took six seconds to load. Similarly,MSN.commeasured two megabytes with ads, taking four seconds to load; with ads removed using Purify, it measured 1.8 megabytes and the loading time remained the same.\nBeyond loading times, web page sizes matter because most of thelatest smartphone planshave data limits. Some carriers, like AT&T andVerizon, charge fees if you surpass your data allotment. So the websites with bloated ads not only take longer to load, but they can pad data consumption and phone bills.\nThe battery life of the iPhones we put to the test also improved with ad blocking, though not as significantly as the load times and page sizes. Running our battery-test app on an iPhone 6s over a Wi-Fi network, it took four hours to completely drain a fully charged battery with Purify enabled, about 42 minutes longer than when the same test was run with ad blockers disabled. With Crystal on, it also took four hours to deplete the battery, while the 1Blocker app took 3 hours and 42 minutes.\nAd blockers can have some technical downsides, such as causing websites to load erratically. A recent analysis by Fortune found that the Crystal app caused websites for retailers like Sears, Walmart and Lululemon toload with pieces of content missingor with broken online shopping carts. Crystal has since fixed those sites to load properly, and Mr. Murphy said he included a tool for users to report other sites that were not loading correctly.\nSo is mobile ad blocking worth it? While a 21 percent battery life increase from using Purify or Crystal may seem attractive, keep in mind that this applies only to web browsing, which is just one of many tasks you do on a smartphone. In everyday use, the improvement to overall battery life will be subtle.\nBut consumers who use ad blockers will enjoy speedier access to web content, not to mention the slimmer data sizes of web pages. That may encourage some publishers to re-evaluate their choices in mobile advertising methods.\nIf anything, ad blockers increase transparency into the different paths that publishers take when integrating ads into their websites. Some publishers appear to carefully consider how ads affect the performance of your device, while others either do not care or lack the resources to do so.\nAs for me, the test results spurred me to keep Purify enabled on my iPhone. While I\u2019m browsing, the app lets me easily denote a website whose ads I want to allow to be shown, an action known as \u201cwhitelisting.\u201d\nThat means the websites I enjoy visiting that have slimmer ads \u2014 likeTheGuardian.com, and, ahem, NYTimes.com \u2014 will be whitelisted. But sites saddled with ads that belong in digital fat camp will remain blocked for the sake of my data plan."

        "title": "Obama Won\u2019t Seek Access to Encrypted User Data",
        "fulltext": "CUPERTINO, Calif. \u2014 The Obama administration has backed down in its bitter dispute with Silicon Valley over the encryption of data on iPhones and other digital devices, concluding that it is not possible to give American law enforcement and intelligence agencies access to that information without also creating an opening that China, Russia, cybercriminals and terrorists could exploit.\nWith its decision, which angered the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies, the administration essentially agreed with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a group of the nation\u2019s top cryptographers and computer scientists that millions of Americans would be vulnerable to hacking if technology firms and smartphone manufacturerswere requiredto provide the government with \u201cback doors,\u201d or access to their source code and encryption keys.\nThat would enable the government to see messages, photographs and other data now routinely encrypted on smartphones. Current technology puts the keys for access to the information in the hands of the individual user, not the companies.\nThe first indication of the retreat came on Thursday, when the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, told the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the administration would not seek legislation to compel the companies to create such a portal.\nBut the decision, made at the White House a week ago, goes considerably beyond that.\nWhile the administration said it would continue to try to persuade companies like Apple and Google to assist in criminal and national security investigations, it determined that the government should not force them to breach the security of their products. In essence, investigators will have to hope they find other ways to get what they need, from data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted over phone lines, which are covered by a law that affects telecommunications providers but not the technology giants.\nMr. Comey had expressed alarm a year ago after Apple introduced an operating system thatencrypted virtually everythingcontained in an iPhone. What frustrated him was that Apple had designed the system to ensure that the company never held on to the keys, putting them entirely in the hands of users through the codes or fingerprints they use to get into their phones. As a result, if Apple is handed a court order for data \u2014 until recently, it received hundreds every year \u2014 it could not open the coded information.\nMr. Comey compared that system to the creation of a door no law officers could enter, or a car trunk they could not unlock. His concern about what the F.B.I. calls the \u201cgoing dark\u201d problem received support from the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence officials.\nBut after a year of study and extensive White House debate, President Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to compel the companies to give the government access would fail, both politically and technologically.\n\u201cThis looks promising, but there\u2019s still going to be tremendous pressure from law enforcement,\u201d said Peter G. Neumann, one of the nation\u2019s leading computer scientists and a co-author ofa paperthat examined the government\u2019s proposal for special access. \u201cThe N.S.A. is capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.\u201d\nIn the paper,released in July, Mr. Neumann and other top cryptographers and computer scientists argued that there was no way for the government to have a back door into encrypted communications without creating an opening that would be exploited by Chinese and Russian intelligence agents, cybercriminals and terrorist groups.\nInside the White House, the Office of Science and Technology Policy came largely to the same conclusion. Those determinations surprised the F.B.I. and local law enforcement officials, who had believed just months ago that the White House would ultimately embrace their efforts.\nThe intelligence agencies were less vocal, which may reflect their greater capability to search for and gather information. The National Security Agency spends vast sums to get around digital encryption, and it has tools and resources that local law enforcement officials still do not have and most likely never will.\nDisclosures by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden showed the extent of the agency\u2019s focus on cracking and circumventing the encryption of digital communications, including those of Apple, Facebook, Google and Yahoo users.\nThere were other motivations for the administration\u2019s decision. Mr. Obama and his aides had come to fear that the United States could set a precedent that China and other nations would emulate, requiring Apple, Google and the rest of America\u2019s technology giants to provide them with the same access, officials said.\nTimothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, sat at the head table with Mr. Obama and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, ata state dinnerat the White House last month. According to government officials and industry executives, Mr. Cook told Mr. Obama that the Chinese were waiting for an opportunity to seize on administration action to insist that Apple devices, which are also encrypted in China, be open to Beijing\u2019s agents.\nIn January, three months after Mr. Comey began pressing companies for special government access, Chinese officials hadthreatenedto do just that: They considered submitting foreign companies to invasive audits and requiring them to build back doors into their hardware and software. Those rules have not been put into effect.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s position was also undercut by officials\u2019 inability to keep their own data safe from Chinese hackers, as shown by theextensive cyberattackat the Office of Personnel Management discovered this year. That breach, and its aftermath, called into question whether the government could keep the keys to the world\u2019s communications safe from its adversaries in cyberspace.\nWhite House officials said they would continue trying to persuade technology companies to help them in investigations, but they did not specify how.\n\u201cAs the president has said, the United States will work to ensure that malicious actors can be held to account, without weakening our commitment to strong encryption,\u201d said Mark Stroh, a spokesman for the National Security Council. \u201cAs part of those efforts, we are actively engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors\u2019 use of their encrypted products and services. However, the administration is not seeking legislation at this time.\u201d\nBut here in Silicon Valley, executives did not think the government\u2019s announcement went far enough.\nAccording to administration officials and technology executives, Mr. Cook of Apple has pressed the White House for a clear statement that it will never seek a back door in any form, legislative or technical \u2014 a statement he hoped to take to Beijing, Moscow and even London. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britainhas threatenedto ban encrypted devices and services, like the iPhone and Facebook\u2019s popular WhatsApp messaging service, but has done nothing so far to make good on that threat.\nTechnology executives are determined to reassure customers abroad that American intelligence agencies are not reading their digital communications. It is an effort driven by economics: 64 percent of Apple\u2019s revenue originates overseas.\nApple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft argue that people put not only their conversations but their entire digital lives \u2014 medical records, tax returns, bank accounts \u2014 into a device that slips into their pocket. While Mr. Obama has repeatedly said he is sympathetic to the concerns of law enforcement officials, he made clear during a visit to Silicon Valley in February that he was also aware of privacy concerns and that he sought to balance both interests.\nTechnologists responded that, with regard to encryption, no such balance existed. \u201cThe real problem is, I don\u2019t see any middle ground for dumbing down everything to make special access possible and having the secure systems we need for commerce, government and everything else,\u201d Mr. Neumann said."

        "fulltext": "Last week, the heads of two of America\u2019s biggest companies said almost the same thing about what personalized technology would mean to the future of business.\nFirst, Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said his consumer technology company was starting to address the business world, which people in tech call \u201cthe enterprise.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to make tools to help people change the world, and that means being in the enterprise,\u201d Mr. Cook said at a conference on Tuesday for Box, a company that makes online storage and collaboration tools. It is, he said, \u201ca huge opportunity for us.\u201d\nJeffrey Immelt, the chief executive of General Electric, endorsed that view later in the day. \u201cIndustrial companies have yet to feel the benefit of the Internet the way consumers have,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\nEach man takes his stand relative to where he sits. Mr. Cook talked about the prospects for the kind of mobile Internet services delivered on iPhones and iPads and developed on Macs. Mr. Immelt is building a system of sensors and so-called predictive data analysis that he hopes will deliver to G.E. $10 billion in revenue by 2020.\nThat same year, G.E. is forecasting, there will be one billion connected electric meters, 100 million connected light bulbs and 152 million connected cars globally.\nBut what does it mean for business technology to be like consumer tech? Looking at consumer tech today, the answer is personalization.\nGoogle looks at your searches, emails and other online behavior and sends you a likely ad. Facebook reads your social behavior to the same end. Online media uses tracking cookies. The iPhone logs your location and sends it to various places.\nIt doesn\u2019t end there. Tesla cars and Nest thermostats are designed to watch what you do with them and adjust themselves to better serve you.\nRemarkably, mass-produced goods increasingly personalize into something unique because of a lot of snooping on you. Few consumers turn personalizing features off, adjust use or boycott the products. In a conflict of personalization and privacy, personalization has triumphed.\nMr. Immelt foresaw much the same kind of thing happening with machines. \u201cWe can now track every jet engine separately throughout its life,\u201d he said, giving each one the machine equivalent of a Facebook page, which states where it is and how it is \u201cfeeling,\u201d making maintenance more efficient.\nChanging the behavior of devices will enable companies, he said, \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t allow any space between the customer and you.\u201d\nMr. Cook was less clear, but Apple\u2019s joint agreements with Cisco Systems and IBM aimed at business are almost certain to involve a lot of personal identification and location awareness, if only in the name of corporate security.\nThere are already office apps that interact with people depending on location and job status. Equipment and software like whiteboards or conference-call phones record who is in a meeting or tag what was said.\nMany people expect to see machines develop relationships with their operators. \u201cA camera on every machine will identify who you are,\u201d said William Ruh, the head of G.E.\u2019s digital business. \u201cIt will configure itself optimally for the person using it, or be looking at you and others and figuring out the best practices for its own operation.\u201d\nTaking orders from a lathe, he noted, \u201ccould feel threatening, but it\u2019s the opposite \u2014 it\u2019s effective on-the-job training.\u201d\nThat sounds like a high-tech version of Taylorism, the so-called scientific management pioneered by Frederick Winslow Taylor a hundred years ago. Taylor timed workers doing things like shoveling and lifting, broke their work into discrete steps and figured out the optimal speeds that work could be done.\nOptimal behavior became a quota, akin to the way packers in warehouses are timed today. A small problem: Taylor made up or fudged a lot of his \u201cscientific data,\u201d but the idea stuck.\nWe may see a big data version of the idea. \u201cIt will be based on billions of objective data points, not crude rules of thumb,\u201d said Erik Brynjolfsson, a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt will be personalized to individuals under different conditions and times of day, and it will be more flexible.\u201d\nMr. Brynjolfsson is one of the authors of \u201cThe Second Machine Age,\u201d a book on an industrial world enchanted by computing. He foresees other peculiarities.\n\u201cWith enough data, you can infer drug use or political persuasions,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are things that are racing ahead, and we haven\u2019t thought them through.\u201d\nThere will be benefits like buying a used car and knowing how it was driven and what is likely to go wrong with it. There may also be challenging effects from companies that collect and manipulate their data the best.\n\u201cThere is a huge opportunity for efficiency gains, but there will be side effects from taking out all the opacity around how things last and behave,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said. \u201cA product that is 30 percent, or even three-tenths of a percent better will get ordered more.\u201d\nA good place, in other words, to be Apple or General Electric. The rest of us may have to be on our toes. It is likely that a lot of others will be. If it turns out like the consumer Internet, we\u2019ll be delighted with the rewards of being spied on, even if we don\u2019t know what they are yet."
