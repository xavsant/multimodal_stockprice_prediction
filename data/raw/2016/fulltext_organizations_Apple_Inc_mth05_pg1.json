        "fulltext": "Silicon Valley is built on precise engineering, data-driven analysis and software as rational as the semiconductors on which it runs.\nIt is also one of the most emotional locations in American business.\nIn this case, we\u2019re not talking about the irrational exuberance in the management of a company likeZenefits, where greed for growth may have led to regulatory cheating, and greed for fun meant beer kegs at work.\nThere is also the irrationality of glitz and aura and living with fickle consumers, as Brian Chen discusses in hisstoryon Fitbit.\nFitbit makes a device that tracks things like steps and sleep from a wearer\u2019s wrist. Founded in 2007, the company has over 1,000 employees and last year sold 21.3 million devices, almost twice the number of a year earlier.\nSound good? It might be, but for the aura accorded to Apple products. For many tech product reviewers and fans, Apple\u2019s Watch, wrist-worn and capable of doing what Fitbit does, it the standard by which Fitbit falls short.\nThe Apple Watch does more things. The Apple Watch is an Apple product, and those sell well. Fitbit announces a new product and its stock drops, because it is not Apple.\nNever mind that Fitbits sell for much less, probably to a different audience, or that Apple\u2019s lastquartershowed declining sales. While Apple is quick to trumpet its sales triumphs, after a full year it still hasn\u2019t given numbers on Watch sales. (Estimates are that it sold 12 million, but with unknown profitability, partly because of the huge marketing put behind Apple Watch.)\nThe real problem the company seems to be struggling with is that it is not Apple, which basks in an aura of cool design excellence and unbeatable success.\nFitbit is a single-purpose device, unlike the multipurpose iPhone or Watch, but that\u2019s been true for years, and Fitbit keeps increasing sales. It may be that there is room in the world for both things.\nOn the other hand, that may be too rational a view for the tech world and its investors."

If so, they are not immediately obvious as in alternative iPhone apps likeCamera Plus.\nA.Apple\u2019s ownCamera appfor its iOS 9 software doesinclude a zoom functionamong other discrete controls that you can use to affect the look of your pictures as you snap them. When you have the Camera app open and a subject in frame, put two fingers on the screen and pinch them together or apart to make the app\u2019s zoom slider appear.\nOnce you see the zoom slider, you can move it with your finger to get in a little closer on your subject before you press the shutter button. In addition to tapping the shutter button on the screen, you can press either of the volume buttons on the side of the iPhone to take the picture.\nApple\u2019s Camera app has an equally subtle control for manually adjusting the exposure of the photo you are preparing to take, should you want to override the software\u2019s automatic exposure system. When you have your subject framed, tap the screen to focus the camera where you want it. Once you tap to focus and the yellow box on the screen confirms your focus area, put your finger on the small sun icon that appears next to that yellow box and slide it up or down to adjust the exposure.\nIf you are taking pictures of a moving object or have fluctuating lighting conditions, you can lock the exposure and focus for your shot. Just press your finger on the area of the image you want to use for exposure and focus until a small yellow banner that reads \u201cAE/AF LOCK\u201d appears on the screen. When you want to unlock the setting, tap the screen again."

        "fulltext": "Digital encryption, with its mind-numbing mathematics, is hard to do. It\u2019s almost as tough as the arguments on what to do with it.\nAsCecilia Kang writes, the United States government is facing off with the American technology industry over a bill that would require tech companies to comply with court orders seeking access to people\u2019s encrypted data. The two sides are engaged in heavy and vigorous behind-the-scenes lobbying.\nOn first pass, the government has a good point: In moments of grave danger, or to establish a chain of evidence, there are good reasons to think authorized warrants should not be limited by actions taken by companies.\nBut the companies have their own points: If they build software that can be cracked or opened, they are building flawed products that hackers know they can exploit.\nMoreover, these are multinational companies that might have to grant the same secrets-reading powers to totalitarian states where they also do business. Whether the companies are giving up people\u2019s privacy to foreign or American police, many of their top engineers might leave instead of abetting.\nTurning to the general public for guidance will not make this easier. Some people are for absolute personal privacy, no matter whether you are a piano teacher or an ISIS recruiter. Others think the government should be able to see your every move \u2014 after all, if you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong, what have you got to hide?\nThe great middle, however, doesn\u2019t like ISIS, or living in a world where a police officer reads our love letters (or notes on organizing an antigovernment protest).\nWhat seems to bother the government as much as the problems of cheap, plentiful and effective electronic secrecy is the new militancy companies are bringing to the issue.\nIt\u2019s not just that Apple and Google are lobbying against this bill. In April, Microsoftsuedthe Justice Department, challenging secrecy orders that keep Microsoft from telling people the lawmen have a warrant to see their email.\nMeantime, software development is moving faster than lawmaking. Last month, Viber, a free communications app owned by Japan\u2019s Rakuten,saidit had put full encryption on every message. The app, which is popular internationally, was previously considered to have weak security. WhatsApp, owned by Facebook and used by one billion people globally, did the same, andpublished a white paperon just how good it is.\nThat\u2019s another casualty of modern tech: It\u2019s hard to control information when it\u2019s hard to see national borders."

        "title": "Police and Tech Giants Wrangle Over Encryption on Capitol Hill",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the district attorney of Manhattan, visited Washington late last month to argue his case on a pressing issue: encryption.\nIn a string of meetings with members of Congress, Mr. Vancetold central lawmakersthat encryption needed to be diminished during criminal investigations. During a 45-minute session with Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mr. Vance said his office had 230 iPhones that might contain crucial information for cases but were useless because Apple refused to help the police break the encryption on the devices.\n\u201cI wanted to express a sense of urgency around resolution of this issue,\u201d Mr. Vance said in an interview about his Washington visit.\nA day afterMr. Vancewas on Capitol Hill, tech executives including Kent Walker, the general counsel of Google, and Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, also met with lawmakers \u2014 but with a very different message on encryption. Tech executives at the meetings said they were concerned about any laws that would force companies to weaken the security of their technology, according to news officials representing these companies.\nThis kind of behind-the-scenes lobbying has become de rigueur in Washington as the battle over encryption shifts to Capitol Hill. It is the next phase ofa bitter dividethat spilled into public view this year when Apple refused to comply with a court order to help bypass security functions on an encrypted iPhone used by an attacker in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting last year. Doing so would have let the F.B.I. gain access to the phone. That case ended after the F.B.I. foundan alternative wayinto the device.\nYet thestandoffbetween the United States government and Silicon Valley tech companies continues \u2014 and the flurry of activity around the issue is broadening. Last month, a Senatedraft encryption bill, written by Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, rallied the attention of both sides. The bill would require tech companies to give access to encrypted data with court orders.\nLaw enforcement officials immediately announced their support of the bill and began to push lawmakers to back it. Trade groups representing tech companies like Apple and Facebook have flooded into congressional offices, sent letters expressing concerns that the bill weakens consumer privacy and security, and delivered scorching speeches about the proposals.\n\u201cThis is an escalating fight,\u201d said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a research firm based in Washington that is funded by tech companies including Google and Microsoft. \u201cIt\u2019s become the focus now in Washington, with hearings and legislative activity.\u201d\nLaw enforcement officials blame tech companies for creating the impasse.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question our relationship with the tech industry has gotten worse, and now it seems like the tech industry is taking every opportunity they have to put up obstacles in our way, including trying to derail legislative efforts that would give law enforcement what they need to keep people safe,\u201d said Terrence Cunningham, president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.\nFacebook, Google and Microsoft declined to comment on their lobbying activity. An Apple spokesman said the company has met regularly with members of Congress on encryption and other issues.\nThe amount of lobbying on the encryption bill is unusual at this early stage of a bill\u2019s life, showing the stakes involved. Tech companiesare reluctantto give access to encrypted information from their users, for privacy reasons and because it may affect their businesses. Law enforcement officials say their efforts to prevent and solve crime are hampered if they cannot see digital data on phones, messaging services and other technology services.\n\u201cToday, terrorists and criminals are increasingly using encryption to foil law enforcement efforts, even in the face of a court order,\u201d Senator Feinstein said in a statement about the draft bill. \u201cWe need strong encryption to protect personal data, but we also need to know when terrorists are plotting to kill Americans.\u201d\nThe rhetoric in Washington around encryption has grown increasingly sharp. Last month, when the contents of the draft encryption bill were leaked, the president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon among its 4,000 members, spoke to an audience filled with government officials at a lunch hosted by the Media Institute.\nThe bill is \u201cdangerously overreaching and technically unsophisticated,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president of the association. \u201cThis bill would essentially make effective cybersecurity illegal in the United States, pushing companies that take cybersecurity seriously offshore.\u201d\nOther tech trade groups, including Reform Government Surveillance and the Business Software Alliance, have also waded into the fray, sending critical letters and meeting with senators to warn of the dangers of the bill. And Silicon Valley executives have, in increasing numbers, made the trek to Washington to make their cases directly.\nBob Lord, chief information security officer at Yahoo, visited several members of Congress in late April to talk about the technology behind encryption and to warn of the \u201cunintended consequences\u201d of legislation that could weaken security. While he did not specifically mention the Burr-Feinstein bill, he emphasized how consumers and human rights activists worldwide depend on encrypted technology for their safety and privacy.\n\u201cThe notion that we would weaken encryption or provide back doors, those suggestions will have unintended consequences,\u201d Mr. Lord said.\nLaw enforcement officials, in turn, have frequently met with the same lawmakers in the Senate and House intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees who are being targeted by the tech companies, according to congressional staff members. Chief Cunningham and other members of the police chiefs\u2019 group have talked with Mr. Burr and Ms. Feinstein, given opinions during the drafting of the legislation and hosted panels on encryption for House and Senate lawmakers.\nTech companies have turned to certain politicians to champion their cause, such as Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. On the day the draft encryption bill was introduced, Mr. Wyden, who voted against the 2012 copyright bills known as the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, which were also opposed by the tech industry, said he had been flooded with calls from tech companies wanting to know what he would do.\nMr. Wyden said he intended to filibuster the proposal. He has since met with Intelligence Committee members to persuade them to kill the bill.\n\u201cI have not filibustered many issues, but I think the stakes are enormous,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in an interview. \u201cThe bill as written is a lose-lose, because it will create less security, American families will be less safe, and your liberty and privacy will be damaged.\u201d\nFor all the lobbying, few lawmakers have expressed their views on the encryption bill.\n\u201cI\u2019m reserving judgment,\u201d said Senator King, who met with Mr. Vance last month. \u201cThe issues are so complex, it\u2019s like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\u201d"

In a letter it planned to send to users on Friday, which The New York Times reviewed, Swift warned that the two attacks\n                                                    bore similarities and were likely part of a\u201cwider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks.\u201d\nBanking experts said the attacks might be impossible to solve or trace. Swift said the thieves got their hands on legitimate network credentials, initiated the fraudulent transfers and installed malware\n                                                    on bank computers to disguise their movements.\n\u201cThe attackers clearly exhibit a deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operation controls within the targeted banks\u2014 knowledge that may have been gained from malicious insiders\n                                                    or cyberattacks, or a combination of both,\u201dSwift said. It also warned that the gang of thieves may have been able to recruit bank employees to hand over credentials.\nSecurity experts who have studied the attacks said the thieves were probably lurking inside the bank systems for months before they were detected and are likely to strike again.\nSwift\u2019s core messaging system was not breached, but the criminals attacked the banks\u2019 connections to its network. Banks are responsible for maintaining the security of their own connections\n                                                    to Swift and digital criminals have found ways to exploit loopholes in bank security to obtain login credentials and dispatch fraudulent Swift messages.\nThis second attack suggests a highly sophisticated threat that did not depend on weak digital defenses.\n\nAPPLE INVESTS IN UBER\u2019S RIVAL IN CHINA|Apple has put$1 billion into Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s biggest ride-hailing\n                                                    service, in one of its largest ever strategic investments,Mike Isaac and Vindu Goel report in The New York Times.\nThe move into on-demand transportation is unusual for Apple, which hasgenerally been quiet about its deals. It has purchased technology start-ups here and there, and bought Beats for $3 billion in\n                                                    2014.\nApple\u2019s has also invested in the Chinese company as iPhone sales have flagged in China, and its iBooks and iTunes mobile stores were shut in the country.\n\u201cDidi exemplifies the innovation taking place in the iOS developer community in China,\u201dTim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said in a statement.\nApple has been working on its own secret car projectand certainly has the money to spare. As of March 26, the company said it had nearly $233 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nDidi Chuxing, is a major competitor to Uber, which is spending millions to make inroads in the Chinese market. Didi serves close to 300 million users, according to the company.\n\nMINNESOTA LAW SCHOOL CUTS ADMISSIONS|The University of Minnesota has decided to shrink enrollment topreserve its national standing as a top law schooleven as some are arguing for broader inclusion of students who would fall outside the school\u2019s admissions parameters,\nElizabeth Olson reports in DealBook.\nApplications to law schools have plummeted nationwideand the Great Lakes region has been hit particularly hard, an effect amplified by the number of accredited law schools in the area. The region\u2019s\n                                                    rapidly aging population and the loss of its traditional manufacturing activity have eroded an economic base that could support a \u201cstrongly upwardly mobile middle class of the kind that sustains\n                                                    high-level educational activity,\u201d David Barnhizer, a professor emeritus at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, wrote in a research paper.\nMinnesota has had one of the largest declines in applicants among the top 20 law schools, but no one knows why.\nDavid Wippman, the dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, has already overseen a shrinking first-year class, offsetting the loss in tuition income with more public subsidies. He said the school\n                                                    was trying to determine why applications for the course were dropping and was trying to identify students more precisely, while publicizing more broadly.\nMr. Wippman had to decide whether to admit students with lower scores, but a surplus of graduates who do not find jobs can eviscerate a law school\u2019s reputation. Raising tuition was not an option with\n                                                    so many students wary of taking on high debt. The school was also facing competition from others in its hometown.\nSo the school opted for fewer students. It can at least tap into taxpayer funding, and almost three-quarters of its first-year students are from out of state and pay higher tuition fees. It has also shed\n                                                    staff and left openings unfilled.\nThe execution of Mr. Wippman\u2019s strategies fall to his successor, Garry W. Jenkins, a law professor from Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. Mr. Jenkins has experience as a former chief\n                                                    operating officer and general counsel of the Goldman Sachs Foundation.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Data onretail sales during Aprilwill be published at 8:30 a.m. TheUniversity of Michigan consumer surveyfor May will be published at 10 a.m.John C.

Trump,Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.\nMr. Mnuchin sat with Scott Brown, the former Republican senator from Massachusetts, as he shook hands with prospective Trump donors. He also a attended a dinner that included the billionaire hedge\n                                                    fund manager Kenneth C. Griffin, David H. Petraeus, the former C.I.A. director and John A. Boehner, the former House speaker.\nPresidential politics was the main topic in the speeches delivered onstage, at the closed-door meetings and at the Champagne-filled after-hours events.But for many on Wall Street, it would beawkward to publicly support Mr. Trump,\n                                                    in light of his broadsides against the hedge fund industry. Many in the financial world said they would never support a Democratic candidate but have also publicly objected to Mr. Trump. Even Anthony\n                                                    Scaramucci, who runs the investment firm SkyBridge Capital and who last week publicly endorsed Mr. Trump, has been one of Mr. Trump\u2019s loudest critics.\nButMr. Scaramucci took a different tone at SALT, saying that Mr. Trump was \u201csaying cuckoo-la-la things to insult the intelligentsia because what he\u2019s discovered is that the average\n                                                    American, the red-meat eating Middle American, loves the swipes at the know-it-alls and I think Donald Trump is enjoying doing that.\u201d\nThe oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens said that he expected most Republicans to fall in line and back Mr. Trump eventually. He told an audience of money managers on Wednesday that heagreed with Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims unless they were vetted.\nIn private and public, hedge fund managers at the conference in Las Vegas have expressed concern that the possibility of Mr. Trump as president could pose arisk to the economy and markets.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nA Bayer-Monsanto Tie-Up Could Be a Bitter Pill|Bayer would be buying a company at the center of the fight against genetically\n                                                    modified crops in Europe, Olaf Storbeck and Kevin Allison write in Breakingviews.Breakingviews \u00bb\n\nCalifornia Approves Deal Between Charter and Time Warner Cable|Charter Communications said its proposal to buy Time Warner Cable\n                                                    was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, overcoming the last hurdle to completing the deal.REUTERS\n\nR.B.S.

        "title": "Fitbit Strives to Escape the Shadow of Apple",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Earlier this year, Fitbit invited guests to a Las Vegas hotel to witness something that it promised would \u201cignite the world of health and fitness.\u201d\nThe event, held during the International CES in January, was intended to make a splash for the wearable tech company\u2019s new product, the Blaze, a $200 smartwatch that measures a wearer\u2019s steps, heart rate and sleep.\nThe watch got a lot of attention that day \u2014 but not all for the better. The term \u201cFitbit Blaze\u201d became one of the most talked-about topics on Facebook and Twitter, but some people were comparing the device,unfavorably, to the Apple Watch. Manyreviews of the gadgetlater made the same Apple comparison. Fitbit\u2019s stock tumbled more than 12 percent that day.\n\u201cI was going in thinking, \u2018This is going to be awesome,\u2019\u201d James Park, Fitbit\u2019s chief executive, said of the Blaze introduction in an interview last month. \u201cI was definitely pretty surprised when I looked at some of the aftermath of it.\u201d\nThe reaction to the Blaze encapsulates the predicament facing Fitbit, the young company that has been a leader in wearable technology: In many people\u2019s eyes, it lives in the shadow of Apple, the Silicon Valley behemoth whose touch-screen smartwatch could potentially stomp its smaller rival out of existence.\nThis even though Fitbit has been trying to do everything right \u2014 and has largely succeeded.\nFitbit, which went public last year, has been increasing revenue at a rate of more than 90 percent as sales of its fitness trackers soar. Last year, Fitbit sold 21.3 million devices, almost double the 10.9 million it sold in 2014. Fitbit, scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, is also the world\u2019s largest maker of wearable devices by market share, according to theresearch firm IDC.\nYet the fact that Fitbit\u2019s products focus on one thing \u2014 tracking your fitness \u2014 is not helping the company\u2019s image in this era of Swiss Army knife devices, where products like the iPhone and Apple Watch can do multiple things. History has been unkind to single-purpose gadgets, many of which have flopped, like Cisco\u2019s Flip camcorder, or have struggled, like the action camera from GoPro.\nCompeting with Apple, whose cash hoard exceeds the size of many countries\u2019 gross domestic product, is also not easy. Although Apple last weekreported its firstsales declineever in iPhones, Apple Watch sales appear to be growing. Apple does not break out sales of the watch, but analysts estimate it has sold 12 million of them since the product\u2019s April 2015 debut.\nAs a result, Fitbit\u2019s stock has fallen about 10 percent since it went public last June. \u201cThere were concerns around competition, particularly from Apple,\u201d Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said of investor skepticism around Fitbit.\nMr. Park said \u201cit actually does not bother me at all\u201d when people frequently compare his company to Apple. He said the Apple Watch serves a different market than Fitbit\u2019s $60 to $250 accessories that focus on health monitoring.\nFitbit purposely took the opposite approach from Apple Watch, he added. The strategy was to begin with simple devices, to make wearables more approachable, and carefully layer on more features over time. In contrast, theApple Watch started out doing a bit of everything: showing notifications, tracking fitness statistics and making phone calls.\n\u201cWe look at it from a consumer point of view,\u201d Mr. Park said. Apple Watch \u201cis a computing platform, but that\u2019s really the wrong way to approach this category from the very beginning.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.\nIndisputably, Fitbit is growing, both in staff and sales. At the company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, a timeline on the wall in the fifth-floor hallway illustrates the firm\u2019s history. In 2007, when Mr. Park, a Harvard dropout who had worked on photo-sharing software, founded Fitbit with his business partner Eric N. Friedman, who is now Fitbit\u2019s chief of technology, the start-up had just two employees. By 2015, it had 1,101.\nInside the offices, furnished in midcentury modern style, employees are constantly shuffling in and out of conference rooms for meetings. On a recent visit, a group of new hires was touring the headquarters.\nStill, a concern among investors is whether Fitbit can extract more money from existing customers. Most of its sales are from people who buy Fitbit devices for the first time, not those who upgrade.\nIn addition, many people may end up leaving their Fitbit devices in a drawer. Of those who bought a Fitbit device in 2015, 28 percent stopped using it by the end of the year, according to the company.\n\u201cThat means that many people who buy Fitbits don\u2019t use them for long, and presumably aren\u2019t going to buy another Fitbit device,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. \u201cThey have to constantly find new people to sell Fitbits to, whereas most consumer electronics companies can rely on a good amount of repeat business.\u201d\nAddressing some of these concerns falls partly to Woody Scal, Fitbit\u2019s chief business officer, who oversees sales and marketing for the company. Last year, Fitbit acquired FitStar, which makes apps offering video instructions on workouts. The apps charge a monthly subscription fee for access to exercise programs, an example of how Fitbit could eventually collect money from software services.\nBut it may be a while before FitStar has an impact on Fitbit\u2019s results; earlier last month, the FitStar app wasranked 157thin the health and fitness category of Apple\u2019s App Store, according to App Annie, a research firm. Fitbit said FitStar had accumulated 3.5 million downloads and has a loyal user base.\nThe big picture for Fitbit, Mr. Scal said, is its evolution into a digital monitoring platform to discover and prevent health problems. Fitbit has teamed up with corporations that offer wellness programs for employees. BP, for example, offers Fitbits to more than 23,000 employees, partly to ensure they are getting enough sleep before they work on oil rigs. Mr. Scal said the data from sleep monitoring, a feature built in to all Fitbit devices, could lead to new health revelations.\n\u201cI believe we\u2019ve tracked more nights of sleep than have ever been tracked in the history of man,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can actually now compare it to normative data that we have and we can identify irregularities.\u201d\nAs for Apple, though Mr. Park said he was not bothered by the rival company, it has long been in his sights. When Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced the iPhone 4S in 2011, for example, Mr. Park had a realization.\nAt the time, the new iPhone added a capability to synchronize with wireless accessories using the standard called Bluetooth. Fitbit trackers back then lacked Bluetooth connectivity, but Mr. Park wanted them to be able to synchronize data immediately with the iPhone.\n\u201cIt could enable a lot of possibilities in terms of real-time feedback,\u201d he said.\nSo Mr. Park gathered a few top employees into a conference room. They decided to re-engineer the Fitbit products to support the new feature. The decision set product releases back about six months, but the revised devices became best sellers.\nMr. Park said Fitbit was poised to innovate products to stay competitive. Sensors are getting more sophisticated, so he imagined a situation where high-end Fitbit devices could eventually support mobile payments or control smart home products like Internet-connected light bulbs.\nYet the products will stop short of resembling the Apple Watch.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be very careful with how we include these things over time,\u201d Mr. Park said. \u201cI think one of the general knocks against smartwatches is that people still don\u2019t know what they\u2019re good for, so they\u2019ve crammed everything in.\u201d"

        "title": "China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews",
        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security.\nApple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people.\nThe reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country\u2019s military and security agencies.\nWhile other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public.\nThe Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy.\nUltimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit.\nFurther, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.\nChina and the United States have been embroiled in a quarrel about tech and security that has strained their relationship. The reviews could be a fresh sticking point, raising questions about the security of American technology and the degree to which American companies will acquiesce to Beijing\u2019s demands for fear of being punished in a huge market still partly controlled by the state.\nChinese officials have not formally disclosed that they are conducting the reviews, and their existence has not been previously confirmed outside of rare, brief mentions in local news media.\nIt is not clear specifically what Chinese authorities are demanding as part of the process. There is no indication that foreign companies have provided access to highly guarded material such as source code \u2014 the digital underpinnings of software \u2014 or other commercial secrets.\nOne Chinese media reportimplied that the tech security reviews began early last year. Over the last nine months, a number of companies have been called in, the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity said.\nThe lack of disclosure by China\u2019s government has made it hard for the United States government to voice its objections, and has fed concerns that China is quietly carrying out further policies to target American technology companies.\nChina\u2019s Internet regulators suggested the possibility of reviews three years ago, after revelations by Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor, concerning surveillance escalated tensions between China and the United States over computer security.\nSince then, China has quietly begun carrying out the reviews. That represents a shift in the way China manages foreign technology. Its previous efforts came through proposed new rules and other public measures that let foreign companies and governments resist.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China said in a faxed response to questions that many countries carried out security reviews and that the inspections did not target any particular country or product.\nChina relies on American technology products, even as it has made clear that it is concerned about the security of those products. A majority of Chinese government offices, state-owned enterprises and other institutions that handle potentially secret information, like universities and research institutes, use Microsoft Windows. Most smartphones in China run software made by either Apple or Google. And the high-end computing that supports China\u2019s banks, energy companies and military uses, in part, American-designed chips and servers.\nIn a congressional hearing last month, Apple\u2019s general counsel, Bruce Sewell,said the Chinese governmenthad asked the company to share source code in the last two years but that Apple had refused.\nApple has seen new pressure in China as regulators have shut down its iBooks and iTunes Movies stores there. Last week, Apple disclosed that it was investing $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, a move that some technology experts saidappeared aimed at currying favorwith Beijing.\nChinese restrictions against American companies have been a highly charged diplomatic issue. Last year, the Obama administration raised concerns about Chinese rules that trade groups said were written towean the country\u2019s banking industryoff foreign technology. The United States also objected to an antiterrorism law that called for foreign companies tohand over encryption keysin China. In both cases China relented, temporarily scrapping the banking laws and tempering the language in the antiterrorism law.\nChina\u2019s tougher tone is part of a broader challenge that governments around the world are posing to the technology industry over issues like privacy and encryption. In the United States, federal law enforcement officials have pressed Apple to help them gain access to encrypted iPhones even as the Obama administration has resisted Chinese policies that would require similar access.\nUnder President Xi Jinping, China has taken steps to keep tabs on technology from American companies and reduce the nation\u2019s dependence on it.\nIn aspeechlast month, Mr. Xi outlined what he described as the two prevalent viewpoints on tech policy in China. Under one, the country would continue with an industrial policy intended to absorb technology from foreign companies and ensure products are \u201csecure and controllable.\u201d That phrase, companies and industry groups said, could include such measures as giving the Chinese government access to systems, providing encryption keys or handing over source code.\nFor foreign companies, the other option could be worse.\n\u201cOne viewpoint holds that we must close ourselves off, make a fresh start, thoroughly shake off our reliance on foreign technology and rely on indigenous innovation to pursue development,\u201d Mr. Xi said, according to a transcript of the speech. \u201cOtherwise, we would always follow in the footsteps of others, and would never be able to catch up.\u201d\nMr. Xi ultimately said China must find a middle ground and determine \u201cwhich things can be imported but have to be secure and controllable; which things may be imported, digested and absorbed for re-innovation; which things can be developed in collaboration with others; and for which things we must rely on our own strength and indigenous innovation.\u201d\nWhile details on the tech reviews are scant, commentary from the state-run China Daily in 2014 suggested that companies affected could include Cisco Systems and Microsoft. Other state news media has said the reviews will prevent product suppliers from \u201cillegally controlling, interfering in or interrupting user systems, or illegally collecting, storing, handling or exploiting information about users.\u201d\nCisco and Microsoft declined to comment on the Chinese media statements. Apple also declined to comment.\nAslide showfrom the China Electronics Standardization Institute, a group that carries out research on behalf of the government, makes the motivation for reviews clear. It links the reviews to concerns about China\u2019s digital security vulnerabilities and what it characterizes as a technology gap between China and countries like the United States, Russia, Israel, Britain and Germany.\n\u201cAs the world connects to the Internet, various forms of attacks and new defensive technologies are ever multiplying, bringing challenges to China\u2019s development of a new digital industry,\u201d the group said."

        "fulltext": "If European regulators get their way, Netflix may soon have to do more than just offer \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d with French subtitles.\nEuropean officials proposed on Wednesday anew set of rulesthat could force Netflix and other video streaming services to carry a minimum amount of local content in individual countries, as well as to help pay for its development. The plan is intended to help level the playing field with national broadcasters, which are already required to fund television shows and other programming in their home countries.\nIt is part of a broader effort to regulate how the 500 million people in the region canbuy, get access to and consumeonline services like video streaming and messaging applications.\nThe changes form the building blocks for Europe\u2019s broad plan for asingle digital market, a strategy that officials say they hope will help bolster the region\u2019s sluggish economy. American technology giants are likely to be the most affected at first, since players like Apple, Facebook and Netflix still dominate much of the online world for Europeans.\nFor Netflix and other streaming services, the proposals, which could go into effect next year at the earliest, mightcomplicate their international expansionplans. Netflix, in particular, has outlined ambitious growth proposals for Europe and beyond, as theAmerican market becomes saturated. The company said last year that it wanted tooperate in 200 countriesby the end of 2016, though it has faced challenges in signing up users in some markets.\nNetflix\u2019s objections to the latest European plan are as much about profit as principle. The company already produces content in Europe, such as \u201cMarseille,\u201d a show about French politics that is similar to \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d and the series \u201cSuburra,\u201d about organized crime in Italy. The company sees such shows, filmed in the local language, as a fundamental way to attract international viewers.\nBut Netflix and others do not want Europe to set specific quotas for the amount of content, arguing that doing so would harm consumer choice as many Europeans want to watch American, not local, programming.\n\u201cWe appreciate the commission\u2019s objective to have European production flourish, however, the proposed measures won\u2019t actually achieve that,\u201d Joris Evers, a Netflix spokesman in Amsterdam, said in a statement.\nNetflix and other American technology companies have found themselves at the center of the changing regulatory environment in Europe.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\nThe company, among others, had previously benefited from a European move tochange copyright rulesto allow customers to temporarily view movies and television shows that they have bought on a digital service, no matter where they are in the 28-nation European Union. Previously, content makers, including Hollywood studios, had staggered movie openings across the region, and film and television licensing rights were typically sold separately in each country.\nEurope\u2019s latest rule changes are more challenging for Netflix.\nEuropean officials on Wednesday said they would give individual countries the power, if they so chose, to force video streaming services to help pay for the production of local content, like movies and television programs.\n\u201cThe way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don\u2019t,\u201d G\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, the European commissioner in charge of the digital economy, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWith these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism.\u201d\nSuch rules already exist for traditional broadcasters, like the BBC in Britain and the TF1 Group in France. On average, they pay the equivalent of millions of dollars each year, or roughly 20 percent of their annual revenue in the countries where they operate, to support local content.\nEuropean policy makers said that online streaming rivals currently invested only around 1 percent of their annual revenue in local content. Netflix has been able to sidestep existing funding rules, most notably in France, because the company\u2019s European headquarters are in the Netherlands.\nStreaming services will also be required to ensure that at least 20 percent of their online content is from Europe, and that those movies and television programs are given prominence in their digital catalogs. A report funded by the European Commission recently found that both Netflix and Apple already met this requirement.\nThe commission\u2019s digital plans are subject to the approval of the European Parliament and individual member states, a lengthy process that could lead to significant changes.\nEurope\u2019s proposals on digital services are only the beginning.\nThe European Commission said on Wednesday that it would also propose new copyright rules in the fall that could force companies like Google to pay online publishers when using their content, including in its news aggregation service Google News.\nOfficials also said that they were still reviewing potential new rules to control how so-called online platforms like Facebook and Amazon operate in the 28-member bloc.\nEuropean officials said they were looking into making it easier for people to move their digital information between online platforms by the end of the year, giving them greater control over data that companies collected on their daily digital lives.\n\u201cI want online platforms and the audiovisual and creative sectors to be powerhouses in the digital economy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, the European Commission vice president in charge of the region\u2019s digital single market proposals. \u201cThey need the certainty of a modern and fair legal environment: That is what we are providing today.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "A planned technology museum in Maine grew out of the curiosity of a 10-year-old.\nIn 2010, Alex Jason traded a minibike and an electric snowblower for an iMac G5 computer, in what turned out to be the start of a giant collection of vintage computer equipment, including 200 Apple machines. It is one of only a few dozen collections of its size and kind in the country.\nAlex, now 15, along with his father, Bill Jason, are planning to display the collection, known asAlex\u2019s Apple Orchard, in a converted library in Fairfield, Me., soon to be theMaine Technology Museum.\nAmong Alex\u2019s pieces is a rareApple I from 1976that still works and has the original chips.Fewer than 70of these models are believed to remain, with oneselling for more than $900,000at an auction in 2014.\nOther prized artifacts include anApple Lisa 2/5, named for the daughter of Apple co-founderSteve P. Jobs; the Cursor III, believed to be an early prototype of a mouse or a joystick for Apple products; and a Powerbook 100, which is considered to be the first modern laptop. Alex said he has not put an assessed value on his entire collection. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s priceless,\u201d he said.\nThe modest beginnings of Alex\u2019s project recall the humble start of Apple itself, which was founded by Mr. Jobs and his high school friendStephen Wozniakin a suburban California garage in 1976.\ntranscript\nNA\nAlex said his first breakthrough was buying a collection of 50 Apple computers \u2014 enough to fill a 26-foot-long U-Haul \u2014 with $2,000 he hadsaved from mowing lawns.\nHe has since acquired computers from other collectors and from eBay and carefully displayed some of them in the basement of the family\u2019s home in a town about 20 miles north of Augusta, Me. Apple memorabilia, such as a giant rainbow-colored logo and schematics of a motherboard, decorate the walls.\nBill Jason is spearheading the effort to convert the Carnegie Library on the campus of Good Will-Hinckley, a charitable organization, into a museum that would open in January 2017. Aside from housing Alex\u2019s collection, theMaine Technology Museumwould be dedicated to interactive exhibits about renewable energy, engineering, computers, space exploration and virtual reality, Mr. Jason said.\nAlex described himself as a longtime tinkerer who studied how tractors worked at the John Deere dealership, explored the innards of computers and once rigged a plastic pipe to a garbage bin to get rid of crumpled papers and crumbs from his desk.\nHe was inspired to pursue Apple computers after he upgraded the hard drive and RAM on his first computer, the iMac G5, on his own.\nAdam Rosen, who maintains theVintage Mac Museumfrom his home in Boston, estimated that there are several dozen large private collections of Apple computers in the country. The planned museum in Maine would be one of the few public exhibits of Apple computers, along with others inGeorgia,CaliforniaandWashington, he said.\nMr. Rosen said Apple has not opened a museum of its own and he knew of only two museums \u2014 inPragueandSavona, Italy\u2014 that are solely dedicated to its computers. Stanford University Library, located in the heart in Silicon Valley, has alarge collection of the company\u2019s records, which Apple donated in 1998.\nApple did not respond to an email seeking comment for this article.\nAlex said he has been drawn to the design, durability and efficiency of Apple products. On Saturday he was looking for so-called Easter eggs, or surprises hidden by software programmers, on Macintosh SE models that reveal a slide show of the company\u2019s development team.\nPerhaps surprisingly, Alex said he does not use an Apple, relying instead on a custom-built computer to play games and edit videos. Still, he said, \u201cin my heart, Mac will always be better.\u201d"
