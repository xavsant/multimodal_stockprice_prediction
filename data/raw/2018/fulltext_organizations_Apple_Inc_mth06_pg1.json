        "title": "A Year After Trump\u2019s Paris Pullout, U.S. Companies Are Driving a Renewables Boom",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump announced on June 1 last year that the United States would exit the Paris climate deal, many of America\u2019s largest corporationssaid they would honor the agreement anyway, vowing to pursue cleaner energy and cut emissions on their own.\nA year later,there\u2019s one area where that pledge is highly visible: renewable energy. Dozens of Fortune 500 companies, from tech giants like Apple and Google to Walmart and General Motors, are voluntarily investing billions of dollars in new wind and solar projects to power their operations or offset their conventional energy use, becoming a major driver of renewable electricity growth in the United States.\n\u201cYou\u2019re definitely not seeing corporations slow down their appetite for renewables under Trump \u2014 if anything, demand continues to grow,\u201d said Malcolm Woolf, senior vice president for policyat Advanced Energy Economy, a clean energy business group. \u201cAnd it means that many utilities increasingly have to evolve to satisfy this demand.\u201d\nOne big question, however, is whether these corporate renewable deals will remain a relatively niche market, adding some wind and solar at the margins but not really making a sizable dent in overall emissions, or whether these companies can use their clout to transform America\u2019s grid and help usher in a new era of low-carbon power.\nLast year in the United States, 19 large corporations announced deals with energy providersto build 2.78 gigawatts worth of wind and solargenerating capacity, equal to one-sixth of all of the renewable capacity added nationwide in 2017, according to the Rocky Mountain Institute\u2019s Business Renewable Center. (Power companies themselves added much of the rest,often in response to state mandates.)\nThat trend appears to be accelerating. Corporations have already announced deals for another 2.48 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half of 2018, as companies like AT&T and Nestl\u00e9 join the search for cleaner power to fulfill their sustainability goals and take advantage of the rapidly declining cost of renewables.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t intend to do this as a statement about Paris, though it has become a statement that we\u2019re definitely still in,\u201d said Brian Janous, general manager of energy at Microsoft, which has so far bought enough wind and solarpowerto match 50 percent of the demand from its global data centers.\n\u201cBut with how fast wind and solar prices have fallen, we see this as something that makes financial sense,\u201d he said.\nAt least 22 companies in the Fortune 500have committed to buying enough renewable power to match 100 percent of their electricity use in the years ahead. And some analysts say these goals could help spur electric utilities to continue reducing their own emissions even as the Trump administration rolls back Obama-era policieslikethe Clean Power Plan, a regulation focused on reducing carbon emissions from power plants.\n\u201cWe think this is a major trend,\u201d said Lisa Wood, vice president of customer solutions at the Edison Electric Institute, a major utility trade group. \u201cCustomers are becoming the driver.\u201d\nIt can often be difficult for a company that isn\u2019t a utility to procure large quantities of renewable electricity on its own. Walmart has installedon-site solar panels on the roofs and parking lots of at least 350 stores, but not every company has that much real estate in play.\nAnother approach: In deregulated electricity markets,like California or Texas, companies can sign long-term power purchase agreements with energy providers to build new solar or wind facilities. The electricity from these projects typically feeds into the local grid, mixing with electricity from other sources such as coal or natural gas, but the company can legally claim the wind or solar power as its own by buying the renewable energy certificates generated by the project.\nThese agreements have gotten increasingly sophisticated: Companies can even arrange to pay for a new wind farm in a different state, such as Oklahoma, and obtain credits from the project even if the electricity is going to someone else. (Basically, the buyer is creating new wind power without using it directly.)\nBut these large individual deals can be costly and complicated. Apple, for instance, arranged in 2015 to pay $848 million over 25 years for most of the electricity from a large solar farm in California built byFirst Solar, while selling the excess back to the grid.\nWhileApple has said it expects to save millions of dollarsover the long term, there is still risk involved in any such deal. And the company had to create its own energy subsidiary and receive federal approval to trade its excess power, which wouldn\u2019t be practical for most smaller businesses.\nOther large corporations are wielding their influence to persuade utilities themselves to add more renewables and offer more options for their customers. In Michigan, G.M. and Switch, a telecommunications firm, madea deal with their local utilityto pay a fixed price for electricity from a new wind farm.\nPrograms like this, known as \u201cgreen tariffs,\u201d have recently popped up in more than a dozen states, though they are still often limited to larger companies. But some analysts hope that if green tariffs become more popular, utilities will start offering them to everyone else, too. In Washington State, Puget Sound Energyis piloting a programthat would allow smaller customers to buy shares of renewable projects.\n\u201cIf we can show utilities that the demand is there, that could convince regulators to expand these programs and allow access for smaller companies,\u201d said Rob Threlkeld, global manager for renewable energy at G.M., which has set the goal to buy 100 percent renewable power by 2050.\nEven that\u2019s only the first step. Industry groups like theRenewable Energy Buyers Allianceare currently trying to explore other ways that small businesses might be able to band together and voluntarily purchase green power.\nMr. Janous of Microsoft, who is engaged in these discussions, says that this aggregation has so far proven to be incredibly challenging. \u201cBut if it\u2019s just Microsoft or just the Fortune 500 companies buying renewable power, that\u2019s not going to be transformative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go beyond that.\u201d\nA few companies, most notably Google, are now wrestling with an even harder question: What if simply buying up large quantities of wind and solar power isn\u2019t enough?\nAt the end of 2017, Googleannouncedthat it had purchased an amount of renewable electricity equivalent to all the power used by its data centers and facilities worldwide. Apple achieved a similar benchmark in April, and other companies are hoping to follow suit.\nBut, as Google itself readily acknowledges, this doesn\u2019t mean that the company is truly powered by 100 percent renewable energy. In many cases, its wind and solar farms operate in different regions (or different countries) than the company\u2019s data centers do. What\u2019s more, the wind and solar farms it has procured don\u2019t provide steady power 24 hours a day, whereas Google\u2019s data centers run around the clock. That means the company is essentially still reliant on fossil fuels to keep the broader grid running.\nFor its next phase, Google wants to locate all of its clean-energy projects in the same grid regions as its data centers, even though that will mean prodding policymakers in places like Taiwan to overhaul electricity markets and allow companies to make direct purchases. Google is also trying to figure out how to assemble a suite of zero-carbon energy sources that can run 24 hours a day, which may require additional technologies like battery storage, demand response programs or even nuclear power.\nBut achieving that goal will take years, and is likely to be far more complicated than simply signing renewable energy contracts.\n\u201cReaching 100 percent renewable energy is an important milestone, but it\u2019s just the beginning,\u201d said Michael Terrell, head of energy market strategy at Google. \u201cWe have to keep our eyes on the ultimate prize, which is to enable carbon free power in every hour of every day.\u201d"

        "title": "Microsoft Employees Protest Work With ICE, as Tech Industry Mobilizes Over Immigration",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 In an open letter posted to Microsoft\u2019s internal message board on Tuesday, more than 100 employees protested the software maker\u2019s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked the company to stop working with the agency, which has been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico.\n\u201cWe believe that Microsoft must take an ethical stand, and put children and families above profits,\u201d said the letter, which was addressed to the chief executive, Satya Nadella. The letter pointed to a $19.4 millioncontract that Microsoft has with ICEfor processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities.\nCalling the separation of families \u201cinhumane,\u201d the employees added: \u201cAs the people who build the technologies that Microsoft profits from, we refuse to be complicit. We are part of a growing movement, comprised of many across the industry who recognize the grave responsibility that those creating powerful technology have to ensure what they build is used for good, and not for harm.\u201d\nThe letter is part of a wave of tech workers mobilizing this week against the Trump administration\u2019snew \u201czero tolerance\u201d policythat refers for criminal prosecution all immigrants apprehended crossing the border without authorization. The policy has resulted in about 2,000 children being separated from their migrant parents, raising a bipartisan outcry.\nAt Silicon Valley companies including Google, Apple and Facebook, employees have in recent days circulated internal emails asking for donations to nonprofit groups that support immigrants. Many have shared information about protests in San Francisco and Washington. And some of the workers have spoken to their managers about the issue or called on internal message boards for their chief executives to respond.\nThe activity has had an effect. Late on Tuesday, after Microsoft\u2019s employee letter went up, the company releaseda memo from Mr. Nadellain which he called the immigration policy \u201ccruel and abusive\u201d and said Microsoft was not working with the federal government on any projects to separate families. Microsoft\u2019s president, Brad Smith, also publisheda blog posttitled, \u201cThe Country Needs to Get Immigration Right.\u201d\nTheir comments came after other tech chief executives spoke up on Tuesday. Apple\u2019s chief, Timothy D. Cook, inan interviewwith The Irish Times, called the immigration policy \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, tweeted that he was a \u201ctop donor\u201d to the American Civil Liberties Union and said that \u201cif there is some way for me to help these kids I will do so.\u201d Sundar Pichai of Google, Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber and Chuck Robbins of Cisco alsotweetedtheir opposition to the policy.\nOn Facebook, two former employees of the social network starteda fund-raiseron Saturday to collect $1,500 for migrants who needed legal assistance because of the new policy. By Tuesday afternoon, the effort had garnered more than $5 million from donors who included numerous tech workers, according to a spokeswoman for the fund-raising drive.\nAmong the donors were Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a Facebook spokesman said. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg called for more donations and said the policy of splitting up immigrant children from their families needed to be stopped. Ms. Sandberg, inher own Facebook post,called the cries of the children taken from their parents \u201cunbearable\u201d and added that the practice \u201cneeds to end now.\u201d\nThe activity by tech workers is reminiscent ofprotests in January 2017when many Silicon Valley employees were up in arms over an executive order from President Trump that suspended immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries. At the time, Google employees held rallies to object; Amazon and Expedia were among the companies that filed in court to stop the order. (Many tech companies comprise workers who are first-generation immigrants or who grew up in immigrant families.)\nSince then, tech workers have watched their companies increasingly come under scrutiny for their moral and ethical behavior. Many tech employees have begun organizing against actions by their own companies \u2014 in April, for example,thousands of Google employees signed a letterprotesting the company\u2019s involvement in a Pentagon program that uses artificial intelligence in weaponry.\ntranscript\nThis image has become a powerful representation of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration: a 2-year old girl sobbing, as U.S. border patrol agents searched her mother. \u201cIf you cross the border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. If you are smuggling a child, then we will prosecute you. And that child may be separated from you as required by law.\u201d The Trump White House\u2019s tactic of systematically separating migrant families is a dramatic shift. There have been cases of families being separated under the previous two administrations. But it\u2019s always been the exception, not the rule. That said, Trump\u2019s crackdowns are happening against the backdrop of more than a decade of stepped-up enforcement at the Southern border. In 2005, President George W. Bush launched \u201cOperation Streamline\u201d along the Texas border. He was responding to a spike in apprehensions there. The program called for criminally prosecuting all migrants. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get control of our borders. We\u2019re making this country safer for all our citizens.\u201d The idea of zero tolerance took root under Bush, and it\u2019s what Trump has used to model his policy after. The Bush-era program meant that migrants who were caught in certain border states were put through the criminal system, not civil immigration courts. It made exceptions for adults traveling with children, but others were ushered through mass trials aimed at deporting them quickly. It\u2019s a practice that\u2019s still around today. \u201cOne of the things we committed to do was end \u2018catch and release\u2019 by the end of fiscal year 2006.\u201d Under this policy, migrants were held until their deportation hearing. And that meant an increase in beds at private detention centers. In 2014, President Barack Obama declared a crisis at the Southwest border after a surge of unaccompanied minors, mostly from Central America. \u201cWe now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.\u201d During that child migrant crisis, the Obama administration also focused on deporting people quickly and put some through criminal proceedings. But it chose to hold families together in administrative, not criminal detention. The Obama administration also set up makeshift overflow facilities. And we saw similar images back then, of adults and children behind chain-link fences draped in thermal blankets. Now, Trump is reportedly taking it a step further and considering makeshift tent cities to detain minors caught at the border. The Trump administration says it\u2019s now merely enforcing the letter of the law. But images of children in detention have made it hard to sell it in political terms, and humanitarian ones, too.\nOn Monday,the A.C.L.U. also demandedthat Amazon stop selling a facial recognition software tool,called Rekognition, to police and other government entities because it feared it could be used to unfairly target immigrants. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft, based in Redmond, Wash., publicly promoted its work with ICE in January in a blog post, citing it as an example of the success of its technology.\nAt the same time, Microsoft has been positioning itself as tech\u2019smoral leader. Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith have publicly said they want to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.\n\u201cWe need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,\u201d Mr. Nadella said at Microsoft\u2019s developer conference last month.\nSome Microsoft executives earlier objected to the Trump administration\u2019s new immigration policy. On Sunday, Mr. Smithpenned a LinkedIn post, saying the news of migrant children being taken from their families was \u201cespecially poignant.\u201d\nYet criticism of Microsoft\u2019s work with ICE began to grow. One Microsoft engineer, Larry Osterman, tweeted on Monday to ask how working with ICE matched with the company\u2019s \u201cethical stances.\u201d\nMat Marquis, an independent developer who works with Microsoft, also said ina tweeton Monday that he no longer planned to work with the company because of its ICE contract. When he receives his last payment from Microsoft, he said, he plans to donate the money to a group providing support to families that had been separated at the border.\nLate Monday, Microsoft issueda statementsaying that it was not working with federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border and that it was not aware of its services or products being used for that purpose. It also said it was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the immigration policy and urged that it be changed.\nBut for many Microsoft employees, that was not satisfactory. A group of about a dozen employees began working together to draft the protest letter, in which they said the company\u2019s statement \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201d\nThe employees continued, \u201cWe are providing the technical undergirding in support of an agency that is actively enforcing this inhumane policy.\u201d\nThe letter added that Microsoft should not only cancel its contract with ICE but be open to a review of its contracts with government agencies domestically and internationally, and that it should create a policy stating it would not work with those \u201cwho violate international human rights law.\u201d\nMicrosoft declined to comment on the employee letter, which was posted internally on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, it had received more than 100 signatures.\nIt was only later that the messages from Mr. Nadella and Mr. Smith decrying the immigration policy were released. \u201cWe will always stand for immigration policies that preserve every person\u2019s dignity and human rights,\u201d Mr. Nadella said."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Thesmartphone patent warsare finally over.\nApple and Samsung settled a seven-year legal fight on Wednesday, ending the most prominent case ina series of lawsuitsover smartphone patents over the last decade.\nThe companies did not disclose the settlement amount. A jury in May ordered Samsung topay Apple $539 millionfor infringing on its patents.\nApple firstsued Samsung in 2011for copying the design of the iPhone, kicking off a winding trail of countersuits, trials and appeals, including astop at the Supreme Courtin 2016.\nApple initially sought to block Samsung phones from the market, but the technology at dispute has long been outdated, and the fight has since largely been about money. Apple at one point sought more than $2 billion, while Samsung had argued it owed just $28 million.\nWith two of global industry\u2019s biggest players fighting over one of history\u2019s most successful products, the case was one of the most closely watched legal fights in modern business.\n\u201cAnd if I had to characterize it, it didn\u2019t really accomplish anything,\u201d said Brian J. Love, a Santa Clara University law professor who tracked the case. \u201cClose to a decade of litigation, hundreds of millions of dollars spent on lawyers, and at the end of the day, no products went off the market.\u201d\nApple won on paper, but it failed in its goal to gain a competitive advantage over Samsung and other phone makers in its series of lawsuits against them, said Mr. Love and Michael A. Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School who studies patent law.\nAfter years of legal fees and countless hours of its executives\u2019 time, Apple walked away with negligible profits on the cases, particularly in the context of its $267 billion cash pile. Apple still earns most of the smartphone industry\u2019s profits, but Samsung and other handset makers have kept up the pressure with strong market share and innovative products.\n\u201cApple can find better ways of earning hundreds of millions of dollars than fighting a decade-long lawsuit,\u201d Mr. Love said.\nFor other companies, the case is likely to serve as a lesson that \u201cthe courtroom is not always the place to try to get ahead,\u201d Mr. Carrier said. \u201cThere\u2019s always the trade-off between litigation and innovation, and in the time these companies spent in the courtroom, they weren\u2019t innovating.\u201d\nHe said the case set the legal precedent that even if a company is shown to infringe on some patents, the courts might not block the product if the patents at issue play a small role in the device.\nAn Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, referred to a previous company statement that said the \u201ccase has always been about more than money.\u201d\n\u201cApple ignited the smartphone revolution with iPhone and it is a fact that Samsung blatantly copied our design,\u201d Apple said in the statement. \u201cIt is important that we continue to protect the hard work and innovation of so many people at Apple.\u201d\nA Samsung spokeswoman, Danielle Meister, declined to comment."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s slate of original programming will now have something for the kids.\nIn its first foray into children\u2019s programming, Apple announced on Wednesday that it has ordered two shows \u2014 one live-action, the other animated \u2014 from Sesame Workshop, the maker of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d In addition, Apple has put a Sesame Workshop series centered on puppets into development.\nThe announcement brought the number of series publicly confirmed by Apple to 15. The company has said it will start streaming its offerings next year, when it will begin competing in earnest against Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.\nNext Monday will be a landmark day for those entertainment ambitions. That is when the crime drama \u201cAre You Sleeping\u201d is scheduled to go into production. The series \u2014 starring Octavia Spencer, a project of Reese Witherspoon\u2019sHello Sunshineproduction company \u2014 will be the first show from Apple\u2019s new slate to start filming.\nOther Apple series have experienced hiccups. Two of them \u2014 a revival of the 1980s Steven Spielberg anthology series \u201cAmazing Stories\u201d and a drama with a morning-show setting that stars Ms. Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston \u2014 have seen changesin the executiveproducer ranks.\nAnother show that Apple purchased from Ms. Witherspoon, based on a collection of short stories by Curtis Sittenfeld, lost its star this week. Kristen Wiigis departing the seriesafter citing a scheduling conflict with filming on the \u201cWonder Woman\u201d sequel, in which she will play the villain, Cheetah.\nThose fits and starts have hardly kept Apple from making announcements. In recent days, the company has announceda content deal with Oprah Winfrey; ordered a show called \u201cLittle Voice\u201d from the producer J.J. Abrams, with songs written by Sara Bareilles; struck a deal with the playwright and television writer Alena Smith for a comedy starring Hailee Steinfeld as the great American poet Emily Dickinson. It has also given the green light to \u201cLittle America,\u201d an anthology series from Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, the husband-and-wife screenwriting duo behind \u201cThe Big Sick,\u201d and Lee Eisenberg, an executive producer of \u201cThe Office.\u201d\nWhen Apple began courting producers last year, it said it had abudget of about $1 billion to work with. Now it is becoming clear that the company will blow well past that figure. In charge of Apple\u2019s lineup are two veteran television executives, Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlich, who previously ran Sony Pictures Television, the studio behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\nApple has been saying for months that its offerings would include children\u2019s programming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have all been aggressive in that arena,believing that such content is a big attractionfor parents to subscribe to their services.\nAlthough it is a nonprofit educational organization, Sesame Workshop has no intention of being left behind in the midst of the deal-making craze that has accompanied the rise of the streaming industry.\nWith the Apple deal, it is making a concerted effort to expand beyond \u201cSesame Street,\u201d the series that began on PBS in 1969 and now counts HBO as the home for its first-run episodes. Sesame Workshop has its biggest programming slate in 15 years, with a new animated series, \u201cEsme and Roy,\u201d expected to premiere on HBO in August."

        "fulltext": "Each week, Kevin Roose, technology columnist at The New York Times, discussesdevelopments in the tech industry, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two. This week, Farhad Manjoo, also a technology columnist, makes a return to the roundup as well. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nFarhad:Hello, Kevin! I\u2019ve been off for three months to write a book. What\u2019d I miss?\nKevin:Tons! Let\u2019s see. There was the G.D.P.R. rollout, the continued Facebook privacy freakout and thecivil war at Google over using A.I. to target drone strikes.\nOh, and speaking of A.I., this is a little awkward but \u2026 our bosses spent the past three months training a neural network to replace you as the author of this newsletter. DeepFarhad isn\u2019t quite ready yet, but our engineers are confident that it will attain Farhad-level insights fairly soon.\nBut while you\u2019re still here in human form, let\u2019s talk about the year\u2019s biggest overarching tech narrative: the \u201ctechlash\u201d against companies like Facebook and Google over issues like privacy, data protection and antitrust concerns. As someone who has been mercifully spared from every twist and turn of the techlash, does it feel like a lot has changed since you left?\nFarhad:You know what\u2019s weird? Though there was a lot of drama when I was gone \u2014 a tech C.E.O. on Capitol Hill! \u2014 I\u2019m struck by how little has changed, really.\nWhen I left, Facebook was under the gun, Amazon was getting hit by President Trump, and Apple and Google were trying to stand clear of the fallout. Three months later, Facebook is still under the gun, the president still regards Amazon as a pariah, and Apple and Google still would very much like to be excluded from these narratives.\nI\u2019m not saying I was expecting wholesale structural change among entrenched businesses over the course of a season. But, still: For all the fireworks in Washington, there\u2019s been little movement on regulation or legislation to curb some of the excesses in tech. I don\u2019t see much of an advance toward stricter antitrust scrutiny of the large tech firms. And their most recent earnings reports show they\u2019re all going gangbusters; Americans may harbor growing worries about the power of tech companies, but not enough to make us quit them.\nWhich isn\u2019t to say the techlash isn\u2019t real, just that change will come slowly. We\u2019re all living in a world where most communication and commerce is ruled by a handful of nearly unregulated oligopolies. That sort of thing doesn\u2019t change quickly, I guess.\nKevin:Yeah, it\u2019s definitely been a slow roll. And all of the scrutiny seems to be affecting companies\u2019 public images more than their business models. I was curious, so I looked at the movement in the stock prices of Facebook, Google/Alphabet, Amazon and Twitter since you left on March 1. Facebook is up 8.5 percent, Alphabet is up 7 percent, and Amazon is up 13.6 percent. Twitter is up a whopping 24 percent. [Editor\u2019s note: Maybe because Farhad tweeted less?]\nTechlash indeed!\nFarhad:Let\u2019s turn to this week. On Monday morning I went to WWDC, Apple\u2019s annual developer conference, which usually brings a slew of previews of the stuff Apple is working on. This year\u2019s keynote was a muted affair. There were no announcements about Apple\u2019s hardware \u2014 though this is usually a show about software, Apple often uses it to preview some new devices, too \u2014 and even the changes to Apple\u2019s apps and operating systems weren\u2019t that flashy.\nThis was on purpose, for good reason. Every few years, Apple takes a break from releasing a bunch of new features and instead focuses on fixing up what\u2019s under the hood of its software. This year, it is promising substantial speed improvements in its next version of iOS. It\u2019s also outlining a plan tolet developers port their iOS apps to the Mac, which could either be awesome or totally useless \u2014 we\u2019ll see.\nAnd then there was the bit about how we\u2019re all staring at our phones too much. The tech industry has been consumed recently by new worries over \u201ctech addiction,\u201d and both Facebook and Google recently announced plans to tackle digital \u201cwell-being.\u201d Now Apple\u2019s jumping in, too. In the next version of iOS, your phone will give you detailed stats about how often you use your phone and what you do on it, and it will even let you block yourself and your children from using certain apps.\nThe features looked great to me. I can\u2019t wait to use them. But I do wonder how effective they will be; asI wrote this week, Apple\u2019s stop-using-your-phone announcements were awkwardly surrounded by announcements (like its new augmented reality system) that will only make your phone more irresistible. I\u2019m not sure we can resist.\nKevin:Me, either. The irresistibility of smartphones is the reason that, despite being eligible for an upgrade for years, I have stuck with my horrible iPhone 7, which has a cracked screen and hilariously short battery life. The awfulness of my phone is the only thing that prevents me from staring at it 24/7.\nI\u2019m also curious about whether Apple will continue to escalate itsfeud with Facebook. I was stunned that during the demos at Apple\u2019s developer conference, they showed a new privacy feature in Safari that blocked ad trackers from Facebook.com. It\u2019s a subtle, passive-aggressive tweak, but by Silicon Valley standards, it seemed like a huge insult.\nIt seems slightly opportunistic to kick a social network while it\u2019s down, but Apple\u2019s aggressive criticism also highlights the real and growing philosophical differences between the two companies. Facebook is an advertising-supported communications conglomerate aimed at the masses, and dead set on remaining free so that all seven billion humans on Earth can eventually be connected (and monetized) through its platform. Apple is predominantly a high-end hardware business that caters to an increasingly privacy-conscious consumer base, and thinks that security will be a differentiating factor when people choose which smartphones, tablets and laptops to buy.\nMaybe it was inevitable that these two giants would clash, but to a tech writer who lives for drama, it\u2019s still interesting to watch.\nFarhad:Did any other tech news catch your eye this week? I suspect you\u2019ve got a lot to say about Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of GitHub, right?\nKevin:I do! As a journalist, I use GitHub \u2026 [checks browser history] \u2026 never. But I lovedPaul Ford\u2019s essay in Businessweekabout what it represents within the world of software engineering. He writes that \u201cGitHub made the social dynamics of software development easier to manage and track,\u201d and that for Microsoft, the GitHub acquisition could be a turning point in its historically fraught relationship with open-source developers. It\u2019s also a sign that Microsoft \u2014 the boring, drama-free tech giant that often seems to be forgotten about these days \u2014 is still very much in the game.\nFarhad:Oh, it is. In fact, speaking of stock prices: While I was gone, Microsoft\u2019s market value beat that of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.Microsoft is now the third most valuable company in America, behind Apple and Amazon. Who\u2019d have guessed?\nAnyway, that\u2019s all for now. Here\u2019s hoping that DeepFarhad is ready for next week\u2019s newsletter.\nKevin:Bye!\nKevin Roose writes a column calledThe Shiftand is a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine.

        "fulltext": "\u25a0 Apple is adding tools to help get your information addiction under control.\n\u25a0 The company revealed new software for the Apple Watch.\n\u25a0 A new feature in Apple\u2019s web browser will make it harder for sites to track you.\n\u25a0 The company previewed iOS 12, the new version of the iPhone and iPad operating system, including improved speed, bug fixes and other improvements.\n\u25a0 Apple revealed Siri and photo updates that catches up to competitors.\nThe most notable new feature in iOS 12 is called Screen Time, a tool to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices.\nThe feature shows you a dashboard of apps you regularly use and the amount of time you tend to spend with them. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps: For example, you can give yourself an hour a day to spend inside Instagram, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app. Parents will also be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.\nApple\u2019s software chief, Craig Federighi, said Apple felt it was time to address smartphones\u2019 oversize impact on everyday life. \u201cFor some of us, it\u2019s become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we\u2019ve become,\u201d he said.\nThe announcement was a bizarre one: A company using one of its biggest events of the year to showcase new tools that help customers use its products less.\nBut the move is most likely shrewd. Apple depends on customers buying its devices, not spending lots of time on them. Apple is pitching the tools as evidence that it is putting its customers\u2019 interests first \u2014 and that if people are worried they are addicted to their smartphone, the iPhone is the device that will help them.\nThe new tools are also a shot across the bow to Silicon Valley\u2019s other big tech companies, like Google, Twitter and particularly Facebook, that depend on users spending more time with their services.\nApple\u2019s move is also not happening in a vacuum. Silicon Valley has faced early signs of a reckoning over tech addiction, including an open letter to Apple from investment firm Jana Partners and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System. The letter urged Apple to research the health effects of its products, particularly on children.\nWill this be enough to help people curb their addiction? Presumably, if you set a limit for yourself you will be able to easily remove the restriction and continue using an app like Instagram when you run out of time.\nIf anything, the feature will certainly make people more mindful (and perhaps ashamed) of how often they use certain apps and encourage them to put their phones down.\n\u2014 Brian X. Chen and Jack Nicas\nApple took another swing at its rivals Google and Facebook with tools that sharply diminish their ability to track users as they surf across the web.\nApple said that by default its Safari browser would disable tracking software that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users\u2019 activity across the internet. The software is often embedded in tools to share, comment or \u201clike\u201d content on third-party sites.\nTo share an article directly to Facebook from a news site, for instance, users of Safari will need to manually allow the software to track them. Apple said it would also make it more difficult for companies that track users using a different technology, known as fingerprinting.\nAs the world wakes up to the sheer amount of user data tech companies have collected over the years, Apple is doubling down on its bid to be the privacy-focused tech firm. Unlike Google and Facebook, which rely on user data to sell ads, Apple\u2019s main business is selling devices to consumers, so its focus on privacy has become a central selling point.\nApple said it would also restrict third-party developers\u2019 access to more data on Mac computers, a nod to the scandal over how a Facebook developer enabled the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly harvest the data of millions of Facebook users.\n\u2014 Jack Nicas\nThe Apple Watch\u2019s latest operating system has a nifty throwback to an old technology: walkie-talkie. \u201cYou press to talk, and your friend can hear your voice \u2014 just like a walkie-talkie,\u201d said Kevin Lynch, Apple\u2019s head of Watch software.\nThe feature works only with users who opt in \u2014 I need your approval to send you a walkie-talkie message \u2014 but it\u2019s striking for the way it improves the Watch\u2019s best feature, letting users stay in touch without having to use a phone.\nThere were also a few new features for activity monitoring. The new software will automatically start tracking a workout even if you didn\u2019t let tell it you were working out. And it has a new way to let you compete with friends. For instance, you can set up a weeklong exercise-off between you and a friend.\nBut all this requires waiting. The new OS will be available for the Watch later this year, through a software update.\n\u2014 Farhad Manjoo\nApple\u2019s head of software, Craig Federighi, opened the event with the introduction of a new mobile operating system, iOS 12, an update that he said was focused on speed.\n\u201cFor iOS 12, we are doubling down on performance,\u201d he said. The update increases the speed for many important features of iOS, like the camera app and keyboard. In Apple\u2019s testing, apps launched two times faster in iOS 12 compared with the last system.\nBy highlighting speed, Apple is addressing acommon complaint among owners of iPhoneswho feel that their devices seem to slow down after every new upgrade. Keep in mind that last year, Apple came under scrutiny amid revelations that it slowed performance of older iPhones with aging batteries.\nThe new operating system will work with devices as far back as the iPhone 5S from 2013.\nHere\u2019s something Apple should fix at the event: its Wi-Fi. None of us are able to get on the internet. I\u2019m barely hanging on to a connection on my iPhone hot spot. Wireless has always been spotty at these events with so many devices in the audience fighting for a connection, but this is exceptionally bad.\n\u2014 Brian X. Chen\nIt\u2019s crystal clear that iOS 12 is focused on improving on existing features rather than bombarding users with brand-new features.\nIn addition to updating the Photos app and expanding Siri, Apple made minor updates to its Apple News, Stocks, Messages and FaceTime apps. The Apple News app now lets you discover articles through topics, and the Stocks app now loads Apple News stories that are related to stocks that you follow.\nThe Messages app was updated to let you create some custom emojis with the camera. And the FaceTime app lets you do a video call between multiple people, similar to Google Hangouts.\nAgain, Apple is responding to some negative feedback. Over the last few years, app developers and users have complained that iOS was getting increasingly bloated and confusing to use.\nThis is a good time for Apple to slow down on adding new features, especially after the introduction of the iPhone X, which fundamentally changes how the iPhone works by removing the home button.\n\u2014 Brian X. Chen\nThis software conference illuminates Apple\u2019s revised software strategy. In the past, Apple updated each new version of iOS on an annual basis with a long list of new features.\nBut recently, the company announced to employees that it would revise its strategy to a two-year cycle. In other words, next year, you can expect iOS 13 to have a barrage of new features. In the following year, iOS 14 will focus on improving those features. Rinse and repeat.\nHowever, Apple doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down the pace of upgrades for the Apple Watch, a much younger product. Each version of Watch OS has introduced significant changes to the way the watch works. Apple\u2019s allocation of resources to the watch shows that the company is treating the wearable computer as the post-smartphone device.\nIn a decade, will we all be wearing our phones?\n\u2014 Brian X. Chen"

        "fulltext": "Investors have returned to the safety and growth of the biggest technology stocks.\nFive big tech companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix and Nvidia \u2014 closed at historic highs on Tuesday. Alibaba and Facebook have done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26.\nThe rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.\n\u201cIn an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,\u201d Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.\nSuch economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.\n\u201cInvestors have been well served by the current global dominance of American tech companies, and yet there is plenty of chatter about changing this winning approach,\u201d Nicholas Colas,co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a recent note.\nIn March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook\u2019s handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.\nThe pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflix is up 6,500 percent. The S.&P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.\nHow long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.\n\u201cUnlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,\u201d Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote."

        "fulltext": "ByGABRIEL J.X. DANCE,NICHOLAS CONFESSOREandMICHAEL LAFORGIAJUNE 3, 2018\nThe company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.\nThe company formed data-sharing partnerships with Apple, Samsung and dozens of other device makers, raising new concerns about its privacy protections.\nByGABRIEL J.X. DANCE,NICHOLAS CONFESSOREandMICHAEL LaFORGIAJUNE 3, 2018\nAs Facebook sought to become the world\u2019s dominant social media service, it struck agreements allowing phone and other device makers access to vast amounts of its users\u2019 personal information.\nFacebook has reached data-sharing partnerships with at least 60 device makers \u2014 including Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry, Microsoft and Samsung \u2014 over the last decade, starting before Facebook apps were widely available on smartphones, company officials said. The deals allowed Facebook to expand its reach and let device makers offer customers popular features of the social network, such as messaging, \u201clike\u201d buttons and address books.\nBut the partnerships, whose scope has not previously been reported, raise concerns about the company\u2019s privacy protections and compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. Facebook allowed the device companies access to the data of users\u2019 friends without their explicit consent, even after declaring that it would no longer share such information with outsiders. Some device makers could retrieve personal information even from users\u2019 friends who believed they had barred any sharing, The New York Times found.\n[Here\u2019s what we know about Facebook\u2019s partnerships with device makers.]\nMost of the partnerships remain in effect, though Facebook began winding them down in April. The company came under intensifying scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators after news reports in March that a political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica,misused the private information of tens of millionsof Facebook users.\nIn the furor that followed, Facebook\u2019s leaders said that the kind of access exploited by Cambridge in 2014 was cut off by the next year, when Facebook prohibited developers from collecting information from users\u2019 friends. But the company officials did not disclose that Facebook had exempted the makers of cellphones, tablets and other hardware from such restrictions.\n\u201cYou might think that Facebook or the device manufacturer is trustworthy,\u201d said Serge Egelman, a privacy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, whostudies the security of mobile apps. \u201cBut the problem is that as more and more data is collected on the device \u2014 and if it can be accessed by apps on the device \u2014 it creates serious privacy and security risks.\u201d\nIn interviews, Facebook officials defended the data sharing as consistent with its privacy policies, the F.T.C. agreement and pledges to users. They said its partnerships were governed by contracts that strictly limited use of the data, including any stored on partners\u2019 servers. The officials added that they knew of no cases where the information had been misused.\nThe company views its device partners as extensions of Facebook, serving its more than two billion users, the officials said.\n\u201cThese partnerships work very differently from the way in which app developers use our platform,\u201d said Ime Archibong, a Facebook vice president. Unlike developers that provide games and services to Facebook users, the device partners can use Facebook data only to provide versions of \u201cthe Facebook experience,\u201d the officials said.\nSome device partners can retrieve Facebook users\u2019 relationship status, religion, political leaning and upcoming events, among other data. Tests by The Times showed that the partners requested and received data in the same way other third parties did.\nFacebook\u2019s view that the device makers are not outsiders lets the partners go even further, The Times found: They can obtain data about a user\u2019s Facebook friends, even those who have denied Facebook permission to share information with any third parties.\nIn interviews, several former Facebook software engineers and security experts said they were surprised at the ability to override sharing restrictions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having door locks installed, only to find out that the locksmith also gave keys to all of his friends so they can come in and rifle through your stuff without having to ask you for permission,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a research and privacy consultant who formerly served as the F.T.C.\u2019s chief technologist.\nBy Rich Harris and Gabriel J.X. Dance\n\nDetails of Facebook\u2019s partnerships have emerged amid a reckoning in Silicon Valley over the volume of personal information collected on the internet and monetized by the tech industry. The pervasive collection of data, while largely unregulated in the United States, has come under growing criticism from elected officials at home and overseas and provoked concern among consumers about how freely their information is shared.\nIn a tense appearance before Congress in March, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, emphasized what he said was a company priority for Facebook users.\u201cEvery piece of content that you share on Facebook you own,\u201d he testified. \u201dYou have complete control over who sees it and how you share it.\u201d\nBut the device partnerships provoked discussion even within Facebook as early as 2012, according to Sandy Parakilas, who at the time led third-party advertising and privacy compliance for Facebook\u2019s platform.\n\u201cThis was flagged internally as a privacy issue,\u201d said Mr. Parakilas, who left Facebook that year and has recently emerged as a harsh critic of the company. \u201cIt is shocking that this practice may still continue six years later, and it appears to contradict Facebook\u2019s testimony to Congress that all friend permissions were disabled.\u201d\nThe partnerships were briefly mentionedin documents submittedto German lawmakersinvestigatingthe social media giant\u2019s privacy practices and released by Facebook in mid-May. But Facebook provided the lawmakers with the name of only one partner \u2014 BlackBerry, maker of the once-ubiquitous mobile device \u2014 and little information about how the agreements worked.\nThe submission followed testimony by Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president for global public policy, during a closed-door German parliamentary hearing in April. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, one of the lawmakers who questioned Mr. Kaplan, said in an interview that she believed the data partnerships disclosed by Facebook violated users\u2019 privacy rights.\n\u201cWhat we have been trying to determine is whether Facebook has knowingly handed over user data elsewhere without explicit consent,\u201d Ms. Winkelmeier-Becker said. \u201cI would never have imagined that this might even be happening secretly via deals with device makers. BlackBerry users seem to have been turned into data dealers, unknowingly and unwillingly.\u201d\nIn interviews with The Times, Facebook identified other partners: Apple and Samsung, the world\u2019stwo biggest smartphone makers, and Amazon, which sells tablets.\nAn Apple spokesman said the company relied on private access to Facebook data for features that enabled users to post photos to the social network without opening the Facebook app, among other things. Apple said its phones no longer had such access to Facebook as of last September.\nSamsung declined to respond to questions about whether it had any data-sharing partnerships with Facebook. Amazon also declined to respond to questions.\nUsher Lieberman, a BlackBerry spokesman, said in a statement that the company used Facebook data only to give its own customers access to their Facebook networks and messages. Mr. Lieberman said that the company \u201cdid not collect or mine the Facebook data of our customers,\u201d adding that \u201cBlackBerry has always been in the business of protecting, not monetizing, customer data.\u201d\nMicrosoft entered a partnership with Facebook in 2008 that allowed Microsoft-powered devices to do things like add contacts and friends and receive notifications, according to a spokesman. He added that the data was stored locally on the phone and was not synced to Microsoft\u2019s servers.\nFacebook acknowledged that some partners did store users\u2019 data \u2014 including friends\u2019 data \u2014 on their own servers. A Facebook official said that regardless of where the data was kept, it was governed by strict agreements between the companies.\n\u201cI am dumbfounded by the attitude that anybody in Facebook\u2019s corporate office would think allowing third parties access to data would be a good idea,\u201d said Henning Schulzrinne, a computer science professor at Columbia University who specializes in network security and mobile systems.\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how loosely Facebook had policed the bustling ecosystem of developers building apps on its platform. They ranged from well-known players like Zynga, the maker of the FarmVille game, to smaller ones, like a Cambridge contractor who used a quiz taken by about 300,000 Facebook users to gain access to the profiles of as many as 87 million of their friends.\nThose developers relied on Facebook\u2019s public data channels, known as application programming interfaces, or APIs. But starting in 2007, the company also established private data channels for device manufacturers.\nAt the time, mobile phones were less powerful, and relatively few of them could run stand-alone Facebook apps like those now common on smartphones. The company continued to build new private APIs for device makers through 2014, spreading user data through tens of millions of mobile devices, game consoles, televisions and other systems outside Facebook\u2019s direct control.\nFacebook began moving to wind down the partnerships in April, after assessing its privacy and data practices in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Mr. Archibong said the company had concluded that the partnerships were no longer needed to serve Facebook users. About 22 of them have been shut down.\nThe broad access Facebook provided to device makers raises questions about its compliance with a 2011 consent decree with the F.T.C.\nThedecree barred Facebookfrom overriding users\u2019 privacy settings without first getting explicit consent. That agreement stemmed from an investigation that found Facebook had allowed app developers and other third parties to collect personal details about users\u2019 friends, even when those friends had asked that their information remain private.\nAfter the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the F.T.C. began an investigation into whether Facebook\u2019s continued sharing of data after 2011 violated the decree, potentially exposing the company to fines.\nFacebook officials said the private data channels did not violate the decree because the company viewed its hardware partners as \u201cservice providers,\u201d akin to a cloud computing service paid to store Facebook data or a company contracted to process credit card transactions. According to the consent decree, Facebook does not need to seek additional permission to share friend data with service providers.\n\u201cThese contracts and partnerships are entirely consistent with Facebook\u2019s F.T.C. consent decree,\u201d Mr. Archibong, the Facebook official, said.\nBut Jessica Rich, a former F.T.C. official who helped lead the commission\u2019s earlier Facebook investigation, disagreed with that assessment.\n\u201cUnder Facebook\u2019s interpretation, the exception swallows the rule,\u201d said Ms. Rich, now with the Consumers Union. \u201cThey could argue that any sharing of data with third parties is part of the Facebook experience. And this is not at all how the public interpreted their 2014 announcement that they would limit third-party app access to friend data.\u201d\nTo test one partner\u2019s access to Facebook\u2019s private data channels, The Times used a reporter\u2019s Facebook account \u2014 with about 550 friends \u2014 and a 2013 BlackBerry device, monitoring what data the device requested and received. (More recent BlackBerry devices, which run Google\u2019s Android operating system, do not use the same private channels, BlackBerry officials said.)\nImmediately after the reporter connected the device to his Facebook account, it requested some of his profile data, including user ID, name, picture, \u201cabout\u201d information, location, email and cellphone number. The device then retrieved the reporter\u2019s private messages and the responses to them, along with the name and user ID of each person with whom he was communicating.\nThe data flowed to a BlackBerry app known as the Hub, which was designed to let BlackBerry users view all of their messages and social media accounts in one place.\nThe Hub also requested \u2014 and received \u2014 data that Facebook\u2019s policy appears to prohibit. Since 2015, Facebook has said that apps can request only the names of friends using the same app. But the BlackBerry app had access to all of the reporter\u2019s Facebook friends and, for most of them, returned information such as user ID, birthday, work and education history and whether they were currently online.\nThe BlackBerry device was also able to retrieve identifying information for nearly 295,000 Facebook users. Most of them were second-degree Facebook friends of the reporter, or friends of friends.\nIn all, Facebook empowers BlackBerry devices to access more than 50 types of information about users and their friends, The Times found.\nKatrin Bennhold contributed reporting.\n\nJune 4, 2018\nApril 4, 2018\nMarch 20, 2018\nMarch 17, 2018\nKatrin Bennhold contributed reporting.\nAdvertisement"
