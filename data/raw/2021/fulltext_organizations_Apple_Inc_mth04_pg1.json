        "title": "How Big Tech Won the Pandemic",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nIn the early months of thepandemicin the United States, businesses were closing or were thrown into chaos. Millions of people shut their wallets as they were shut in. Iwrote in On Techat that time that it wasn\u2019t obvious that America\u2019s biggest technology companies would continue to thrive as they had for the last decade or so.\nThe Big Tech bosses sounded uneasy, too. After all, America\u2019s five tech titans didn\u2019t do so hot in the Great Recession nearly 15 years earlier. Maybe they\u2019d suffer this time around, too.\nHahahahaha. Yeah \u2026 They were fine. Really, really fine.\nIn the last year, the five tech superpowers \u2014 Amazon,Apple, Google,Microsoftand Facebook \u2014 hadcombined revenue of more than $1.2 trillion, as I wrote for The Times on Thursday. It was a strange and amazing year for Big Tech. I can\u2019t believe it, but some of the companies are growing fasterandare more profitable than they have been in years.\nThe pandemic has made the tech giants and their bosses unfathomably rich. (Even more unfathomably rich than they were before.) Apple has so much extra cash that it\u2019s spending an additional$90 billion to buy its own stock, nearly the equivalent of Kenya\u2019s gross domestic product. Of the 10richest people in the world, eight made their fortunes from tech companies. The man at the top, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, alone is worth more than one-and-a-half Goldman Sachs.\nI have seen a lot of bananas financial numbers, including from these five tech giants. But I promise you that Big Tech\u2019s numbers are now so wild that I am running out of non-curse words to explain them.\nHow did this happen? I\u2019ll give you two explanations. First, the pandemic created apeculiar economythat benefited some people and industries, including in technology, even as it battered others. In the last year of crisis, people and businesses had even greater demand for what the tech giants were selling.\nThat might seem obvious now, but it wasn\u2019t necessarily a year ago. Americans\u2019 love of home shopping became a safety necessity for some people. Families bought iPads and Macs as work and school went virtual. Any business that still had money to spend on marketingspent it on Google, Facebook or Amazon. Companies might have cut back in other areas, but they definitely bought software from Microsoft and Amazon.\nSecond, the tech giants used the pandemic as a moment to get stronger. In some cases, that meant cutting costs where it matters less, like on travel, entertainment and marketing. Google said it was savingmore than $1 billiona year on those types of expenses.\nOn the flip side, the tech giants spent big in areas that extend their advantage.Amazon spent $50 billionin the last year on big-ticket purchases like warehouses and cloud computing hubs. That\u2019s more than double what Exxon Mobil spends to dig oil and gas out of the ground each year. Again, bananas.\nAs the economiesin the United Statesand some other parts of the world come back to life in 2021, the tech giants are lean, mean and ready to make even more money. The questions that I have now: Are America\u2019s tech powers invincible? And are they winning at everyone else\u2019s expense?\nThe first is impossible to answer, but it sure feels that way. And I put that second question toThomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University, who studies the growing power of dominant companies.\nPhilippon told me that the pandemic and the digital adaptations it forced did help smaller businesses. Restaurants, for example, had toquickly adaptto sell web orders and do deliveries, and many of those investments will help them in the long run, too.\nBut he also believes that the pandemic probably widened the gap between the big and rich companies, including the tech giants, and everyone else. \u201cDefinitely there is a sense that it\u2019s a recession that happened to be good for companies that were already doing well,\u201d he said.\nBig Tech\u2019s success is awkward, though:The European Unionaccused Apple of breaking the lawby using control of its iPhone app store to stifle competition, my colleague Adam Satariano wrote. This is one of approximately four billion antitrust lawsuits or investigations involving the tech superpowers.\nIs this the office or \u201cThe Office\u201d?Google, the company that has set trends for office work and employee perks, is now trying to reimagine the post-pandemic workplace. Dai Wakabayashi and Cayce Clifford detail Google\u2019s plans, which includerobots that inflate temporary, cellophane balloon wallsand camp-themed outdoor work spaces.\nRead this to feel totally uncool:Invented out of the blue by people on TikTok, the term \u201ccheugy\u201d is a new and not-quite-definable shorthandfor things that are a bit generic, trying too hard or out of date. Instagram\u2019s once dominant aesthetic is peak cheugy. Lasagna is apparently cheugy, too? Just read Taylor Lorenz\u2019s explanation of all this.\nPrancer found a home! The Chihuahua that a pet adoption volunteer had described as a \u201crage machine\u201d and a \u201cvessel for a traumatized Victorian child\u201d now lives with a woman in Connecticut, Ariel Davis.\nThephotos of Prancer enjoying the flowersalmost make him seem huggable.

        "title": "Apple AirTag Review: A Humble Tracker With Next-Generation Tech",
        "fulltext": "On the outside,Apple\u2019s new AirTaglooks like a ho-hum product that we have all seen before. It\u2019s a disc-shaped tracking gadget that can be attached to items like house keys to help you find them.\nBut inside, the story gets far more interesting.\nThe AirTag, whichApple introduced last week, is one of the first consumer electronics to support a new wireless technology, ultrawideband, which lets you detect precise proximity between objects. Using ultrawideband, your iPhone can sense whether an AirTag is an inch or dozens of feet away from it. It\u2019s so accurate that its app will even show an arrow pointing you in the direction of the AirTag.\nThat\u2019s far better than other trackers that rely on Bluetooth, an older wireless technology that can only roughly guess an item\u2019s proximity. (More on how this all works later.)\nUsing ultrawideband to find lost items is just one early example of what the technology can do. Because of its pinpoint-precise ability to transfer data quickly between devices, ultrawideband could become the next wireless standard that succeeds Bluetooth. It could lead to better wireless earphones, keyboards, video game controllers \u2014 you name it.\n\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Frederic Nabki, chief technology officer ofSpark Microsystems, a Montreal firm that is developing ultrawideband technology, said of trackers like the AirTag. \u201cIt sends its data really, really fast.\u201d\nI tested Apple\u2019s $29 AirTag, which will be released on Friday, for about a week. I used the tracker to find house keys, locate my dogs and track a backpack. I also ran similar tests with Tile, a $25 tracker that relies on Bluetooth and that has been around for about eight years.\nLast week, Tile complained in an antitrust hearing that Apple had copied its product while putting smaller companies at a disadvantage. From my tests comparing AirTag and Tile, I found that ultrawideband was far superior to Bluetooth for finding items. What\u2019s more, the AirTag demonstrated that ultrawideband is next-generation tech that is worth getting excited about.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nUltrawideband has been in development formore than 15 years, but it was built into chips for iPhones and other smartphones only in the last two years.\nWhen you use ultrawideband to find a tracker, it works similarly to sonar, which detects objects underwater. You send a ping to the tag, and the tag bounces a ping back to your phone. The amount of time it takes for the ping to come back is used to calculate the distance between the two objects.\nBut when you use Bluetooth to find a tracker, your phone is pushing out a continuous signal in search of it. The farther you move away from the tracker, the weaker the signal gets, and the closer you move toward it, the stronger it becomes. This technique is used to tell you roughly how far away you are from the tracker.\nSo what do the two underlying wireless technologies mean in practice?\nTile works with both iPhones and Android phones using Bluetooth technology to find items. Open the Tile app, select an item and hit the \u201cfind\u201d button. The app will look for the Tile and send a signal to connect, after which it makes the tracker play a melody. If the signal connection is weak, it will tell you to move around until the signal gets stronger.\nIf your phone can\u2019t find a Tile because it is outside its range, you can put it in \u201clost mode.\u201d The tracker will search for other Tile owners who have granted the Tile app access to their location to help find other people\u2019s lost items. If a Tile-owning Samaritan is near your Tile, that person\u2019s device will share its location with the Tile network, which will show where the item was last spotted on a map.\nApple\u2019s AirTag works with iPhones both new and old. Newer devices (the iPhone 11 and 12 series) can take advantage of ultrawideband\u2019s precise locator abilities. To find an item, you open the Find My app, select an item and tap Find. From there, the app will form a connection with the AirTag. The app combines data gathered with the phone\u2019s camera, sensors and ultrawideband chip to direct you to the tag, using an arrow to point you to it. Older iPhones can track AirTags with Bluetooth using a method similar to Tile\u2019s.\nSimilar to Tile, when an AirTag is lost and outside the range of your phone, you can put it in lost mode and allow other Apple phones to find the AirTag to help you see where the item was last spotted on a map.\nThe benefits of ultrawideband could easily be seen in a few tests.\nFor one experiment, I asked my wife to hide several AirTags and Tiles throughout our home and then time how long it took me to find them.\nIn one test, she hid an AirTag attached to my motorcycle key somewhere in our bedroom. Apple\u2019s Find My app used an arrow to point me toward the mattress, and I pressed a button to make the tag play a sound. After rummaging through the covers and peeking under the bed, I found the AirTag crammed under the mattress. It took about 90 seconds.\nNext, I had to find a Tile attached to my house key. I opened the Tile app and hit the Find button. The app said the signal was weak and suggested I walk around to find a stronger connection. As I moved downstairs, I could hear the Tile\u2019s melody, and the app said the signal was getting stronger. I found the Tile hidden inside a bin in a garage locker. It took about a minute.\nThe toughest was an AirTag hidden inside a book. Apple\u2019s Find My app pointed toward the correct shelf, but it couldn\u2019t tell me precisely which book the tag was shoved inside. After removing four books from the shelf and flipping through pages, I found the AirTag inside a cookbook. This provided my wife with three minutes of entertainment.\nSeparately, to test how the trackers worked when they were too far from my phone, I attached a Tile and an AirTag to both of my dogs\u2019 collars and put the tags in lost mode when my wife took them for a walk. Nearby smartphones eventually helped me locate both trackers to show me where the dogs were in the neighborhood.\nEven though the AirTag is an impressive demonstration of ultrawideband technology, that doesn\u2019t make it the best tracker for everyone.\nBecause of the AirTag\u2019s compatibility with Apple products, I would give an AirTag to an iPhone owner. But I would give a Tile to a person with an Android phone.\nThe AirTag is also far from perfect. I wish they were louder \u2014 they are very quiet compared with Tiles \u2014 so playing sound wasn\u2019t very helpful for finding them. I also did not love that for most purposes, the AirTag requires buying a separate accessory, like a key ring, to hold the tracker.\nIn contrast, the Tile has a hole punched into its corner to attach to a key ring or zipper head. (The $29 price tag of the AirTag is eclipsed by Apple\u2019s $35 leather key ring.)\nStill, ultrawideband gives AirTag a major advantage \u2014 and even Tile thinks so. CJ Prober, Tile\u2019s chief executive, said last week that Apple had refused to give his company access to the iPhone\u2019s ultrawideband chip to make its own trackers that work with it.\n\u201cThey launched a competing product, and they\u2019re leveraging that technology that allows it to do things that our product can\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Prober said in an interview. \u201cWe really think competition should be fair. Fair competition leads to better outcomes for consumers.\u201d\nApple said in a statement that it had worked hard to protect the privacy of iPhone users\u2019 location data, adding that it embraced competition. This month, itannouncedthat it would soon release a plan for other companies to take advantage of the ultrawideband technology inside Apple devices.\nI\u2019m happy to wait for those products using this neat wireless technology.\nBecause of its greater efficiency at transmitting data, ultrawideband could make future wireless devices immensely better, Mr. Nabki said. As an example, he cited cord-free earphones that connect instantly, use very little battery and sound as good as wired ones.\nThat sounds much cooler than finding house keys."

        "title": "\u2018A Perfect Positive Storm\u2019: Bonkers Dollars for Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "In the Great Recession more than a decade ago,big tech companieshit a rough patch just like everyone else. Now they have become unquestioned winners of the pandemic economy.\nThe combined yearly revenue of Amazon,Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook is about $1.2 trillion, according to earnings reported this week, more than 25 percent higher than the figure just as the pandemic started to bite in 2020. In less than a week, those five giants make more in sales than McDonald\u2019s does in a year.\nThe U.S. economy is cranking back from 2020, when itcontractedfor the first time since the financial crisis. But for the tech giants, the pandemic hit was barely a blip. It\u2019s a fantastic time to be a titan of U.S. technology \u2014 as long as you ignore the screaming politicians, the daily headlines about killing free speech or dodging taxes, the gripes from competitors and workers, and the too-many-to-count legal investigations and lawsuits.\nAmerica\u2019s technology superpowers aren\u2019t making bonkers dollars in spite of the deadly coronavirus and its ripple effects through the global economy. They have grown even strongerbecauseof the pandemic. It\u2019s both logical and slightly nuts.\nThe wildly successful last year also raises uncomfortable questions for tech company bosses, the public and elected officials already peeved about the industry: Is what\u2019s good for Big Tech good for America? Or are the tech superstars winning while the rest of us are losing?\nAmericanshave more money in their pocketsthanks to government stimulus checks and pandemic savings, and the tech giants are getting a significant share. Their combined revenue is equivalent to roughly 5 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.\nBig Tech\u2019s pandemic big bucks have an understandable root cause: We needed its services.\nPeople gravitated to Facebook\u2019s apps to stay in touch and entertained, and businesses wanted to pay Facebook and Google, which Alphabet owns, to help them find customers who were stuck at home. People preferred to buy diapers and deck chairs from Amazon rather than risk their health shopping in stores. Companies loaded up on software from Microsoft as their businesses and work forces went virtual. Apple\u2019s laptops and iPads become lifelines for office workers and schoolchildren.\nBefore the pandemic, America\u2019s technology superpowers were already influential in how we communicated, worked, stayed entertained and shopped. Now they are practically unavoidable. Investors have scooped up Big Tech shares in a bet that these companies are nearly invincible.\n\u201cThey were already on the way up and had been for the best part of a decade, and the pandemic was unique,\u201d said Thomas Philippon, a professor of finance at New York University. \u201cFor them it was a perfect positive storm.\u201d\nTimes weren\u2019t so good for these companies in the last economic rough patch. In the downturn from 2007 to 2009, Microsoft\u2019s sales dropped slightly, and its stock price fell 60 percent from the fall of 2008 to March 2009, a low point for U.S. stocks. Google and Amazon each lost as much as two-thirds of their market value.\nOne sign of how this time is different: Amazon\u2019s revenue is growing much faster in 2021 than it did in 2009, when the company was one-fifteenth its current size.Sales in the first quarterrose 44 percent from a year earlier, and Amazon\u2019s profits before taxes \u2014 which have never been exactly robust \u2014 more than doubled to $8.9 billion. Businesses are addicted to Amazon\u2019s cloud computer services, where sales rose 32 percent, and shoppers can\u2019t live without Amazon\u2019s delivery. Investors love Amazon, too. The company\u2019s stock market value has nearly doubled since the beginning of 2020 to $1.8 trillion.\nFor the other tech giants, it\u2019s as if their brief pandemic nosedive never happened. Advertising sales typically rise and fall with the economy. But as other types of ad spending shrank when the U.S. economy contracted last year, ad sales rose for Google and Facebook. The growth was even better for them in the first three months of this year.\nA year ago, analysts worried that Apple would be crippled as the pandemic gripped China, which is the hub of the company\u2019s manufacturing operations and its most important consumer market. The fears didn\u2019t last long. In the first three months of 2021, Apple\u2019s revenue from selling iPhones increased at the fastest rate since 2012. Sales in mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong nearly doubled from a year earlier.\nThe tech giants are not the only companies rallying in dark times. America\u2019s big banks have alsobeen on a tear. So have some younger technology companies, such asSnapand Zoom, the maker of the pandemic-favorite videoconferencing app. The crisis forced all sorts of businesses to go digital fast in ways that could help them thrive. Restaurants invested in online sales and delivery, and doctors went full bore into telemedicine.\nBut the dictionary doesn\u2019t have enough superlatives to describe what\u2019s happening to the five biggest technology companies. It\u2019s all a bit awkward, really. It\u2019s rocket fuel for critics, including some regulators and lawmakers in Europe and the United States, who say the tech giants crowd out newcomers and leave everyone worse off.\nBig Tech companies say they face stiff competition that leads to better products and lower prices, but their bank statements might suggest otherwise. Facebook\u2019s profit margins are higher now than they were before the pandemic.\nSome of their success is explained by thepeculiarities of the pandemic economy. Some people and sectors are doing awesome, while other families are lining up at food banks and while companies like airlines are begging for cash. Unlike the stock market clobbering in the Great Recession, stock indexes in the United States have reached new highs.\nThe tech superstars have also capitalized on this moment. Alphabet and Facebook have used the pandemic to cut back in places that matter less, such as promotional costs and travel and entertainment budgets. And the tech giants have generally increased spending in areas that extend their advantages.\nAlphabet is now spending more on big-ticket projects, like building computer complexes, than Exxon Mobil spends to dig oil and gas out of the ground. Amazon\u2019s work force has expanded by more than 470,000 people since the end of 2019. That deepens the moat separating the tech superstars from everyone else.\nBig Tech is emerging from the pandemic lean, mean and ready for a U.S. economy expected toroar back to lifein 2021. Meanwhile, there are still long lines at food banks. Some American workers who lost their jobs last year may never get them back. Housing advocates are worried that millions of people will be evicted from their homes. And being Big Tech is an invitation for everyone to hate you \u2014 but you do have towering piles of money."

Many of those jobs will be in high-tech fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence.\nThe overall spending includes its operations at its Cupertino, Calif., headquarters and on data centers across the country, as well as the U.S. taxes it pays.

On Monday, it set a new target of an additional 20,000 jobs in the United States over the next five years. Those jobs include some people hired directly by Apple but also positions at Apple suppliers and data centers. Apple said those jobs now included dozens of TV productions across 20 states for its Apple TV+ video-streaming service.\nThe company said its overall spending would reach $430 billion in the United States over the next five years.\nIn 2018, the company said it wouldspend $350 billion in the countryover the following five years. That figure included a one-time $38 billion tax payment as it moved billions of dollars it was holding overseas under the new tax law signed by former President Donald J. Trump. Apple saved an estimated $43 billion under the law, more than any other company."

        "fulltext": "Years from now, what creature will digest the new iPads and AirTags thatAppleannounced on Tuesday? What soil will absorb their metals?\nThe shiny gadgets of today will be waste tomorrow. As you eye that upgraded tablet, consider that Apple shipped so many new iPads last year that if they were all laid flat and stacked, they would be about as tall as 862 Empire State Buildings. Then think about whatever old iPad of yours is languishing now in some unknown place.\nManufacturers don\u2019t talk much about this turnover when they announce the big new thing that will replace your mostly just as good old thing. This is all by design. There\u2019s a term for it: planned obsolescence, or designing a product with an intentionally limited life span. Ever try to get your TV repaired?\nApple, Samsung, Sony and other manufacturers of high-tech electronics release waves of new hardware every year even as the tide of screens and circuitry is engulfing us in discarded devices.\nNow there is a movement afoot to change that approach.\nThis year, the French government began requiring tech manufacturers to list an \u201cindice de r\u00e9parabilit\u00e9,\u201da repairability score, on product pages for items like the iPhone and MacBook. If a device can be repaired, then its life can be extended, saving consumers money and the planet the burden of so many trashed gadgets. None of Apple\u2019s iPhones or MacBooks earned above a 7, with 10 being the top score \u2014 making the company a \u201cC student at best,\u201d the websiteGristnoted. Other manufacturers like Microsoft and Samsung fared about the same. Equipped with this knowledge, consumers can make better choices about which products to buy. If unrepairable gadgets don\u2019t sell, manufacturers will change course.\nSome59 million tonsof old TVs, computer, screens, smartphones, washers and other electronics are discarded every year. This waste is dangerous. Batteries explode in recycling facilities. Toxic substances like mercury leach into soil and groundwater and disperse in the air. Manufacturing flat screensadds greenhouse gasesto the atmosphere. We need tech companies like Apple \u2014 so progressive in so many ways \u2014 to lead the charge to solve this problem. If they won\u2019t, governments must make them.\nFrance is not alone in stepping into this mess. The movement is in the United States as well. More than a dozen states are considering so-called right-to-repair legislation, arare bipartisanconcern centered on the idea that manufacturers should not restrict access to information and parts that would allow independent shops to fix busted gadgets.\nThe New York State Assemblymember Patricia Fahy will hold avirtual town hallon the topic May 5. Anyone can attend. And the Federal Trade Commission is expected to release a long-delayed report soon on repair restrictions in consumer technology that could set the stage for a bigger push from the Biden administration.\nRepairability is a surefire path toward longevity. Items become waste when they are no longer useful. Some of this is the simple march of progress. Other times, it is much harder to see the justification, such as when a Sonos speaker is cut off from software updates seemingly overnight.\nAlthough tech companies will often speak of sustainability, many lobby against repair legislation, fearful it will loosen their control and eat into their profits. This can lead to a sort of cognitive dissonance.\nApple\u2019s annualenvironmental report, published this month, asserts a commitment to device longevity and sustainability. It also speaks of the Apple Pencil stylus as though it contains secrets lost in some fragment of the Rosetta Stone. The company is \u201cdesigning, developing and testing additional disassembly tools \u2014 including new methods for recovering materials from Apple Pencil,\u201d it says, as though the methods could only be reverse-engineered, rather than integrated from the very first stage of design.\nThere\u2019s the issue in a nutshell: Sustainability matters, but marketable design appears to matter more to these companies. Consumers are urged to upgrade their devices annually. Well north of 1 billion smartphones were shipped in 2020 \u2014 and it was a sluggish year because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nManufacturers must do better. Their devices must be repairable by all and kept compatible with software updates for as long as possible, not artificially obsoleted. Consumers should support right-to-repair legislation. Buy what you please, be it a fancy fridge or a smartphone \u2014 no one is changing the world by holding on to an iPhone 7 for an extra year \u2014 but know to ask three simple questions when you\u2019re shopping: \u201cHow long will this last?,\u201d \u201cHow will I get it fixed when it breaks?\u201d and \u201cHow will I recycle this when I need a new device?\u201d Follow through and get the thing fixed or take it to a trustworthy recycler when it\u2019s time. (Apple\u2019s store employees can help with this step, for instance.)\nIn this world, damage is a certainty. But we cannot leave things broken: A problem of our creation is a problem that can be fixed.\nDamon Beres(@dlberes) is a journalist whose work focuses on the effects of technology on people and the planet.

        "fulltext": "Just about every day now in D.C., lawmakers seem eager to show their might against Big Tech. Yesterday gave them the opportunity to flex their muscles in two high-profile events at the Senate: the confirmation hearing for Lina Khan, a\u201cprogressive trustbuster\u201d who was nominated for a seat at the F.T.C., and ajudiciary committee hearingabout Apple and Google\u2019s control over their app stores. For good measure, a group of seven House Republicans yesterday announced a pledge tono longer take donationsfrom major tech companies.\nHere\u2019s what you may have missed on a busy, and bruising, day for Big Tech \u2014 and what it means.\nLina Khan said she\u2019d bring her tough-on-tech stance to the F.T.C.Ms. Khan referenced a \u201cwhole range of potential risks\u201d she sees in the tech giants, including how they could parlay their dominance in one market into adjacent spaces. She said that when it comes to online advertising, which is fueled by consumer data, \u201ccompanies may think it\u2019s worth the cost of doing business to risk violating privacy laws.\u201d The Democratic nominee received little pushback on her views during questioning.\nAt the other hearing, companies complained about Apple and Google. Spotify, which is suingApplein Europe, said the company blocked it from telling customers that they could find cheaper subscription prices outside its iPhone app. Match Grouptestifiedthat it now paid nearly $500 million a year to Apple and Google in app store fees, its single largest expense. Tile said Apple boxed out its products and then copied them,referencing the AirTag productApple unveiled Tuesday.\nGoogle made a questionable call.Match Group\u2019s chief legal officer, Jared Sine, said Google had called the company the night before, after its planned testimony became public, wondering why the comments appeared to be tougher than what Match had said on a recent earnings call. \u201cIt looks like a threat, it talks like a threat, it\u2019s a threat,\u201dSenator Richard Blumenthal said. Wilson White, a government affairs official at Google, told senators that Match was an important partner and that Google would never aim to intimidate the company.\nWhat happens next?The events were notable for the bipartisan distaste lawmakers showed for Big Tech. The parties have different reasons for being unhappy with social and search platforms, with Republicans focusing on claims of censorship and Democrats on misinformation, but their feelings appear more aligned on potential anti-competitive behavior by Big Tech gatekeepers in areas like app stores. Will this manifest itself into law? Senator Amy Klobuchar has already drafted asweeping antitrust bill, but a more targeted piece of legislation focusing on app store conduct could go through more easily.\nIn a trial next month, Apple is set to face off againstEpic Games, which is suing Apple over the payment terms for its iPhone app, potentially providing more fodder for the critics of Big Tech who are looking to rein it in.\nThe E.U. plans to clamp down on A.I.Draft rules wouldset tight limitson the use of the technology, including in self-driving cars, hiring decisions, bank lending, school enrollment and more. It\u2019s one of the most ambitious efforts to regulate A.I. before it becomes mainstream.\nIndia suffers a surge in Covid-19 cases.The countryrecorded 312,731 new infectionsin a 24-hour period, the highest one-day level since the onset of the pandemic, raising concerns about its ability to control the coronavirus. Separately, Pfizer said it had identifiedcounterfeit versionsof its vaccine in Mexico and Poland.\nCredit Suisse is raising nearly $2 billion after two trading scandals.The Swiss bank has been forced torebuild its balance sheetfollowing the collapse of Greensill Capital and the meltdown of Archegos. Meanwhile, it faces a new inquiry by Switzerland\u2019s financial regulator over potential risk-management faults in its handling of Archegos.\nJanet Yellen calls on corporate America to help the U.S. reach its climate goals.The Treasury secretary said the private sector wouldbear much of the burdenof greening the American economy, and said the Biden administration was devising a financial reporting framework to make it easier to invest in assets like green bonds.\nThe $100 million deli is delisted.Hometown International, which gained an astronomical market cap despite owning one New Jersey deli, wasbarred from the OTCQB over-the-counter marketfor failing to comply with listing rules. The investor David Einhorn had flagged the penny stock\u2019s puzzling market cap as a sign of a \u201cfractured\u201d market.\nAround 100 blank-check funds went public each month in the first quarter of the year. So far in April, you could count the number of those I.P.O.s on two hands. The sudden drop in debuts of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, has market watchers asking whether this is a pause for breath \u2014 or a more permanent plunge in popularity.\nSource: Dealogic, Goldman Sachs\nThe New York Times\nThe slowdown coincides with increased S.E.C. scrutiny.The securities regulator issueda statement at the end of last monthhighlighting \u201cthe key considerations related to the unique risks and challenges of a private company entering the public markets through a merger with a SPAC.\u201d Not long after,another noteoffered \u201cguidance\u201d on some of the trickier accounting issues related to blank-check funds. Neither statement suggested any rule changes, but withGary Gensler, the S.E.C.\u2019s new enforcement-minded chairman, taking over this week, SPAC sponsors have slowed their roll.\nSPACs\u2019 recent performance has also been lousy.Analysts at Goldman Sachs note that a stock price index of 200 SPACs (pre- and post-merger) has badly underperformed the market this year, down 17 percent versus a 10 percent gain in the S&P 500. SPACs have also lagged an index of unprofitable tech stocks, suggesting that investors have particular concerns about SPACs, since plenty of them have acquired other unprofitable tech companies.\nBut we haven\u2019t heard the last of SPACs.The amount of money these shell companies have raised to date could drive $900 billion in M.&A. activity over the next two years, according to the Goldman analysts. And more than 25 SPACs filed I.P.O. registration documents this month, per SPAC Research, adding to a pipeline of more than 200 others that have disclosed plans to go public but haven\u2019t yet sealed the deal, for whatever reason.\n\u2014 Jonathan Frostick, a program manager at HSBC, recalled his first thoughts upon having a heart attack. A LinkedIn post he wrote from his hospital bed aboutreassessing his approach to life and workhas been shared more than 200,000 times.\nThe Super League, the doomed effort to create an exclusive new tournament for Europe\u2019s top soccer clubs, was widely criticized \u2014 byplayers,coaches,fansandpoliticians\u2014 as an effort to import American-style competition and economics. Frank McCourt, the American owner of the storied French soccer team Olympique de Marseille, told DealBook that the league \u2014 which he publicly denounced \u2014 never made sense.\nThe Super League would have created a closed competitionwith guaranteed places for 15 clubs, and would have introduced revenue sharing and spending caps. Thatmore closely resembles U.S. leagueslike the N.F.L. than the more freewheeling system of European soccer.\nA key criticism raised by fans was that the Super League largely eliminated the possibility of underdog teams going on a run and becoming improbable tournament winners (like Porto in 2004).\n\u201cIt felt like imposing an American flavor on a different culture,\u201dsaid Mr. McCourt, who previously owned the L.A. Dodgers before buying control of Marseille (l\u2019OM to its fans) in 2016.JPMorgan Chase\u2019s rolein financing the Super League bolstered this notion, though its architect was Florentino P\u00e9rez, the Spanish president of Real Madrid.\nFor all their money and brand clout, the clubs didn\u2019t take into account what fans wanted,which became clear when public outcry prompted many founding membersto drop out. \u201cThere is no football without fans,\u201d Mr. McCourt said. \u201cWhat is their perspective?\u201d (Fan demands are something that he knows well: He met with several earlier this year after supportersstormed Marseille\u2019s training groundsto protest the club\u2019s performance.)\nMr. McCourt said he favors plans by UEFA, the European soccer overseer, toexpand its Champions Leaguetournament, a much-debated move that gained new urgency as the Super League became a threat. \u201cThere\u2019s a process that UEFA is going through with all of the stakeholders,\u201d he said, contrasting the approach with the more limited decision-making behind the Super League.\nAsRory Smith of The Timesput it: \u201cIt was all, in some way, unserious: There was a cobbled-together website, an uninspiring logo and an American banker, but no broadcaster, no suite of sponsors and, in the end, no commitment to see any of it through.\u201d\nDeals\nU.S. start-upsraised $69 billionin the first quarter, 40 percent more than the previous quarterly record; and private equity firms are more willing tofund mega-leveraged buyouts. (WSJ)\nShares in UiPath rose 23 percent in their trading debut, in one of the biggest public offerings by a software company on record. (Bloomberg)\nMaybe the day traderswereright: Hertz unveiled a bankruptcy reorganization plan that provides some value to pre-Chapter-11 stockholders. (MarketWatch)\nPolitics and policy\nThe White House is weighing options for overhauling opportunity zones, a Trump-era tax break meant to drive investment in poorer areas \u2014 but largely used for development in wealthier ones.

        "title": "To Understand Tech, Look Beyond the C.E.O.s",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nTo understand what\u2019s happening in the world, we need to understand the (mostly) men who rule over global technology superpowers. But I also wish those leaders were less consequential and took up far less of our brain space.\nWhat the 21st-century tech barons like Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Jack Ma believe and do matters. But when we focus on the chief executives, we sometimes neglect to recognize that regular people, not poobahs, make tech as we experience it. VolunteerWikipedia editors,online community moderators, Uber couriers and schoolteachers translate and shape what the tech bosses create into the lived reality for the rest of us.\nMy colleagues and I write a lot about the handful of technology companies that shape our communications with one another, shopping habits, relationship with our government, work and culture. Mammoth institutions like tech giants aren\u2019t one-man shows, but the people at the top are extremely influential.\nWhen we talk about the power of tech companies to change the world, what we really mean is the power ofBezos,Zuckerberg,Sundar Pichai,Tim CookandSatya Nadellato influence billions of people \u2014 whether we (and they) are aware of it or not.\nIt wasn\u2019t a spreadsheet that decided to pay Amazon employees at least $15 an hour,and influenced wages at other employers. Nothing that momentous happens at Amazon unless Bezos wants it. Zuckerberg designed Facebook with him as absolute ruler, and his beliefs are fused into Facebook\u2019s bones.\nIf Elon Musk hadn\u2019t pursued his mission todestroy fossil fuels, governments and major car companies probably would not now beplanning to kill conventional cars. Conflicting corporate agendas plus personal vendettasbetween the chief executives of Apple and Facebook, and Amazon and Tesla, are steering the future of the internet andspace exploration.\nIt\u2019s important to understand how these people tick and how their minds work because their decisions matter so much. And humans \u2014 even the humans running technology companies \u2014 are not robots. All our choices are shaped by who we are, our life experiences and our foibles.\nBut I also wish that the tech power brokers didn\u2019t matter so much, even at their own companies.\nThepeople who moderate Reddit forumsandweed out the worst abuses on Facebookprobably understand better than tech C.E.O.s how internet companies\u2019 designs and policies shape our behavior online. Couriers working for delivery apps like DoorDash have more reasons than anyone topoke at the flaws of the softwaresetting their wages. Teenagerscreating TikTok dancesinfluence what people do in their living rooms for fun.\nTechnology bossesdon\u2019t always foreseehow people will respond to what they create. It is the people in the technology trenches who live the benefits of tech services and their pitfalls, maybe more than the Silicon Valley generals. If they had more influence over the technologies that we use, how might things be different?\nIt\u2019s essential but insufficient to get into the minds of the tech bosses at the tippy top of the world. As technology worms its way into every moment of our lives, there are zillions of mostly unknown people who take the beliefs and preferences of the bosses and remake them in ways that collectively affect all of us.\nWe can try to make sense of the world around us by getting in the minds of the leaders. Or we can pay attention to what the foot soldiers of digital life are doing. We need both.\nWhere extremists can make big bucks:The livestreaming website Twitch has become a place for right-wing personalities to spread conspiracy theories about the election and coronavirus vaccines, my colleague Kellen Browningreported. In some cases, the streamers use the Amazon-owned site as a forum to promote their merchandise or solicit donations.\nLyft is quitting self-driving cars:The company issellingthe operation that was working on driverless vehicle technology to a division of Toyota. Uber alsohanded off its self-driving car projecta few months ago.\nHere\u2019s my newsletter from last year on why driverless car technologyis harder than almost everyone expected. (The start-up I wrote about then, Voyage, also recentlysolditself to a bigger company.)\nAre online thrift stores encouraging excess shopping?People who buy secondhand clothing for resale have become a big draw on TikTok, YouTube and the shopping app Depop, Voxreported. But some of the sellers worry that the trend is making used clothing more expensive for people who need it.\nWatch a dog \u201cwin\u201d a high school relay racein Utah. The human runner is Gracie Laney. The canine athlete is Holly, who broke free andcouldn\u2019t resist sprinting on the track.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "Facebook nearly doubles its profit and revenue rises 48 percent, as tech booms.",
        "fulltext": "Facebooksaid on Wednesdaythat revenue rose 48 percent to $26.2 billion in the first three months of the year, while profits nearly doubled to $9.5 billion, underlining how the social network has continued to benefit during the pandemic.\nAdvertising revenue, which makes up the bulk ofFacebook\u2019s income, rose 46 percent to $25.4 billion. Nearly 3.5 billion people now use one of Facebook\u2019s apps every month, up 15 percent from a year earlier.\nThe results followed a blockbuster financial performance in 2020, as the pandemic pushed people indoors toward their computers and other devices \u2014 and onto the social network and its associated apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 in ever-increasing numbers.Facebookrecorded highs in users and revenues and its services were in such demand that engineers at timesstruggled to \u201ckeep the lights on.\u201d\nYet Wall Street is now expected to scrutinize Facebook\u2019s advertising business closely. On Monday, Apple rolled out an update of its mobile software with a new feature that asks people if theywish to opt out of being tracked by advertisersoutside of apps like Facebook. If people choose not to be tracked, that could hurt Facebook\u2019s business, which relies on user data to target advertising.\nThe situation has putMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, and Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, in conflict with one another. On Tuesday, Mr. Cooktweetedthat Apple hadintroduced the privacy featurebecause \u201cwe\u2019ve always believed that you should be in control of your data.\u201d\nFacebook on Wednesday said it expected some challenges to its advertising this year \u201cfrom regulatory and platform changes, notably the recently-launched iOS 14.5 update, which we expect to begin having an impact in the second quarter.\u201d The company added that the change was baked into its financial guidance.\n\u201cWe had a strong quarter as we helped people stay connected and businesses grow,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to invest aggressively to deliver new and meaningful experiences for years to come, including in newer areas like augmented and virtual reality, commerce and the creator economy.\u201d\nIn recent months, Facebook has also faced continued criticism about the content that flows through its site, especially after former President Donald J. Trump used social media to urge his followers to overturn the results of the presidential election, inciting a mob to storm the Capitol building on Jan. 6.Facebook cut off Mr. Trumpfrom the platform after the riot, though a final decision about whether to keep him off the site indefinitely has not been made."
