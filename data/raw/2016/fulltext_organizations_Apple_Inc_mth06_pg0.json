        "title": "Why the World Is Drawing Battle Lines Against American Tech Giants",
        "fulltext": "Imagine you are a French lawmaker. For decades,you have protected your nation\u2019s cultural outputwith the diligence of a gardener tending a fragile patch against invasive killer weeds.\nYou haveimposed quotas on the French film industry, required radio stations toplay more French music than anyone seems to want to listen to, and you have worked methodically toexempt your actions from international free-trade rules.\nAnd now, out of nowhere, come a handful of American technology companies to wash away all your cultural defenses. Suddenly just about everything that a French citizen buys, reads, watches or listens to flows in some way or another through these behemoths.\nThere is Facebookco-opting your news media. Amazon is dominating book sales, while YouTube and Netflix are taking over television and movies. And the smartphone, arguably the most important platform for entertainment in this era, is controlled almost entirely by Apple and Google.\nThis backdrop of social anxiety explains why Europe is on the march against American tech giants. European governments have been at the forefront of an effort tolimit the reach of tech companies, most often through privacy regulations and antitrust investigations. Now the European Commission is considering rules that would require streaming companies like Netflix tocarry and even pay for local content in the markets they serve.\nThe European efforts are just a taste of a coming global freak-out over the power of the American tech industry. Over the next few years, we are bound to see increasing friction between the tiny group of tech companies that rule much of the industry and the governments that rule the lands those companies are trying to invade. What is happening in Europe is playing out in China, India and Brazil and across much of the rest of the globe, as well.\nThe result is fragmentation. Once, not too long ago, many in the tech industry thought that digital technology would bring about the dawn of a new global order.\nThe internet\u2019s structure was decentralized and nonhierarchical; it therefore seemed immune to control by any single government. Under this dream, the network would bridge vast distances and connect cultures, creating a new system of legal norms that were more uniform around the world.\nBut that is not how it has been playing out.\n\u201cMy assumption is that this is only the beginning,\u201d said Dongsheng Zang, director of the Asian Law Center at the University of Washington School of Law. \u201cWe\u2019ll be seeing more of these governments make their own demands, and the problem is a fragmentation of the global tech companies.\u201d He added, \u201cThis could be a problem for America in the 21st century.\u201d\nThis dynamic may not sound very new. Whether it comes to taxes, privacy, free speech or security, national governments have always sought to impose rules on transnational corporations.\nBut the battle with tech giants promises to be more spectacular. Over the last decade, we have witnessed the rise of what I like to callthe Frightful Five. These companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent \u2014 have created a set of inescapable tech platforms that govern much of the business world. The five have grown expansive in their business aims and invincible to just about any competition. Their collective powers are a source of pride and fear for Americans. These companies thoroughly dominate the news and entertainment industries, they rule advertising and retail sales, and they are pushing into health care, energy and automobiles.\nFor all the disruptions, good and bad, Americans may experience as a result of the rise of the Frightful Five, there is one saving grace: The companies are American. Not only were they founded by Americans and have their headquarters here (complicated global tax structures notwithstanding), but they all tend to espouse American values like free trade, free expression and a skepticism of regulation.\nUntil the surveillance revealed by the National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, many American tech companies were also more deferential to the American government, especially its requests for law enforcement help.\nIn the rest of the world, the Americanness of the Frightful Five is often seen as a reason for fear, not comfort. In part that is because of a worry about American hegemony. The bigger these companies get, the less room they leave for local competition \u2014 and the more room for possible spying by the United States government.\nBut even if that idea sounds hyperbolic (but it doesn\u2019t, right?), there is a deeper fear of usurpation through tech \u2014 a worry that these companies could grow so large and become so deeply entrenched in world economies that they could effectively make their own laws.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is the nation-state is losing its grip,\u201d said Jane K. Winn, also a professor at the University of Washington School of Law, who studies international business transactions. \u201cOne of the hallmarks of modernity is that you have a nation-state that claims they are the exclusive source of a universal legal system that addresses all legal issues. But now people in one jurisdiction are subject to rules that come from outside the government \u2014 and often it\u2019s companies that run these huge networks that are pushing their own rules.\u201d\nMs. Winn pointed to Amazon as an example. The e-commerce giant sells both its own goods and those from other merchants through its marketplace. In this way, it imposes a universal set of rules on many merchants in countries in which it operates. The larger Amazon gets, the more its rules \u2014 rather than any particular nation\u2019s \u2014 can come to be regarded as the most important regulations governing commerce. And because Amazon tends to focus on customer service rather than other values a country might want to prioritize \u2014 fraud protection or workers\u2019 rights, say \u2014 the company could end up becoming theworld\u2019s most powerful consumer protection agency, but one that is unaccountable to some governments.\nThe same dynamic would apply to other companies\u2019 platforms. Rules imposed by the Apple and Google app stores become a kind of law for developers around the world. YouTube\u2019s guidelines become a cultural arbiter anywhere it operates.\nAnd Facebook\u2019s news feed algorithm may matter more to journalists in some countries than any particular legal limit on their operations.\nHow will governments stop the tech companies from expanding their powers? By placing ever higher burdens on them to limit their reach, something we have seen happening more often.\nIn addition to all the moves in Europe, the Indian government juststopped Apple\u2019s plan to sell refurbished iPhones in the country. That came after its move to shut down Facebook\u2019s free internet plan, which had beenwidely criticizedthere as a kind of Trojan horse to take over India\u2019s digital infrastructure.\nIn China,Apple shut downthe iBooks and iTunes Movies stores, apparently after facing pressure from the government.\nApple also invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, China\u2019s homegrown version of Uber, a surprising move thatwas interpreted by China watchersas a way to curry favor with an increasingly aggressive government.\nNobody knows yet who will win these fights. The American tech giants are huge, but they need the blessing of national governments, and those blessings aren\u2019t coming easily.\n\u201cThey\u2019re facing an increasingly self-confident India, Brazil and China,\u201d Mr. Zang said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t back down, they probably have leverage to impose lots of different rules to limit how these companies reach into local markets.\u201d\nOr as the French newspaperLe Monde declaredon the eve of Netflix\u2019s debut in France, \u201cQue le carnage commence!\u201d Let the carnage commence!"

        "fulltext": "Q.With all the complaints about Windows 10 and OS X El Capitan out there, I\u2019m wondering if it is worth it to just skip big operating system upgrades. Is it?\nA.Every computer user should evaluate his or her situation in regard to upgrades, but there are some general pros and cons to consider.\nFrom a security standpoint, skipping an upgrade could make your computer more vulnerable when the older operating system is not updated with protections against the latest viruses, malicious software and human intruders lurking on the internet. Third-party antivirus and anti-malware tools can shield your computer to some degree, but inherent vulnerabilities in older software may leave parts of your system open to attacks.\nDepending on how many versions behind the current system you choose to stay, you may find some applications on your PC or Mac no longer receiving periodic updates from developers because the developers themselves have moved on to newer versions. Hardware manufacturers may also stop creating driver software that allows their peripherals to work on operating systems they deem too old.\nWhile newer features, better security and improved performance can come with a successful upgrade, upgrading to the latest version of Windows or OS X can be also a titanic aggravating hassle \u2014 and can lead to weeks of fussing with the computer to get it working as it once did. On the flip side of the compatibility conundrum, your older programs and devices may not function properly on the newer system unless their makers update their own software. You may have older programs that will never work on the newer system, which can be problematic if you depend on those applications in your daily computing life.\nIn addition to breaking your stuff, an operating system update can also move things around on you, based on the new user interface and the way it organizes your files. The new system might even run like a turtle if you have an older computer.\nThe learning curve becomes easier as you become more familiar with the new system. If you do not have any hardware or software incompatibilities in the mix, biting the bullet and upgrading should pay off with better overall security and a longer life cycle of program updates.\nIf you want to make an informed decision, make a list of all the hardware and software you rely upon and check with those companies about compatibility with the new operating systems. Microsoft and Apple have technical support pages with some useful information, but crowd-sourced databases like theRoaring Appssite let you look for the answers to a lot of compatibility questions at once. No matter what you decide, back up your computer regularly and keep its security software up-to-date."

        "title": "Apple to Offer App Developers Access to Siri and iMessage",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With sales sluggish and stiffening competition from rivals like Google and Facebook, Apple announced on Monday coming improvements to the software that runs its devices, including a revamped Music app, an easier login process and better information-sharing across devices.\nMore significantly, it also made it easier for app developers to tap the full power of Apple\u2019s technology \u2014 from its Siri voice assistant to instant messaging and Apple Pay \u2014 in their own apps.\n\u201cWe believe it is crucial that we provide the best tools so you can produce the best apps,\u201d Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, told a crowd of about 5,000 assembled here for the company\u2019s annual worldwide developer conference.\nThird-party developers write the apps that make an iPhone or a Mac more useful and personal. As the company struggles with flat sales of its products, Apple has beentrying to mendits sometimes troubled relationship with the people who have filled its App Store with two million apps.\nOn Monday, Apple said it was allowing access to two of its crown jewels \u2014 Siri and its messaging app, iMessage \u2014 hoping that the creativity of outside developers will spur a round of innovation to make the iPhone seem as magical as it did when the first apps were introduced eight years ago.\nShowing off how developers could use messaging, an Apple executive opened the food-delivery app DoorDash from inside Apple iMessage and put together a joint order with friends.\nEarlier this year, Facebook opened up Messenger to bots, automated software assistants that can accomplish various tasks. Google also announced plans to introduce a messaging service with similar capabilities.\n\u201cA lot of the messaging apps are moving toward this,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst with Gartner who attended the event. \u201cIf Apple hadn\u2019t announced developer access to messages, I would have been really surprised.\u201d\nDevelopers were also pleased to get access to Siri so they could incorporate voice commands into their own apps. Until now, Siri has mostly been limited to Apple services and has been used for tasks like conducting searches, getting directions or asking the virtual assistant to make a call.\nFaizan Buzdar, chief executive of Convo, a business collaboration software maker, said his company had already been using Siri to a limited extent so that customers could bookmark items that pop up in the Convo app.\n\u201cBut my vision would be to say, \u2018What\u2019s our revenue this week?\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Siri would then open Convo, which would pull in data from its app and partner apps, and provide the answer. \u201cThat kind of natural language can really push the barriers of business.\u201d\nInitially, Siri will only be available for certain categories of apps like those providing ride-hailing, messaging and photo-search services.\nApple has been a leader on mobile devices since the introduction of the iPhone a decade ago. But in some critical respects, it is now playing catch-up.\nFor example, Google, whose Android smartphone software is more popular than Apple\u2019s globally, uses sophisticated facial recognition technology to organize a user\u2019s photos, and Google\u2019s mapping service works closely with other apps to identify important locations and automatically provide directions to appointments.\nApple said on Monday that it would offer similar features in the next version of its iPhone software, iOS 10, which will be released in the fall with a new crop of iPhones.\nSimilarly, Apple\u2019s integration of other services into iMessage mirrors what Facebook has done with Messenger and what Tencent, a major Apple rival in China, has done with WeChat messaging.\nUnlike Google and Facebook, which rely on uploading a user\u2019s data to the cloud, Apple said the new features will keep data on the phone to protect user privacy.\n\u201cIn some ways the star of the show wasn\u2019t a particular product but Apple\u2019s refutation of accusations that it can\u2019t compete with Google and Facebook in artificial intelligence and deep learning,\u201d said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, in an email after the presentation.\nApple is a clear leader in some areas, particularly the nascent field of smartwatches. Announcing improvements to its year-old Watch platform, Apple said that the new version of the watch\u2019s operating system would start apps instantly. Users will also be able to scribble responses to messages one letter at time, instead of relying on the canned responses that are currently available.\nThe Watch remains tethered to the iPhone for most uses, and the company seems to be repositioning it as a healthy-living accessory, offering improved activity tracking and sharing. There is even a new deep-breathing app.\nIn an attempt to persuade customers to buy more Apple products, the company also introduced a host of planned features to share data between devices. The documents on the desktop of a Mac, for example, will be accessible on iPads and iPhones. Photos taken with the iPhone can be viewed on the Apple TV.\nApple signaled its desire to be a player in global e-commerce, where sales are expected to total $2 trillion this year, according to the research firm eMarketer.\nApple said that retailers\u2019 websites would soon be able to use Apple Pay as a checkout method, and customers could authorize a purchase with their fingerprint on their iPhone. Currently, the digital payment service is restricted to physical stores and apps, where it has gotten a lukewarm response.\nA few days before the conference, Apple made two other major announcements affecting developers. It will begin testing paid search ads in the App Store, which will allow developers to buy a slot at the top of the search results when a user looks for an app. Apple also said it would reduce the cut it took from subscriptions in apps to 15 percent, from 30 percent, after the first year.\nWhether Apple\u2019s improvements will be enough to keep developers happily writing apps for the iPhone and other Apple products remains to be seen.\nIf it continues to be difficult for apps to stand out in the App Store, more developers will concentrate ondeveloping great mobile websitesinstead, said Cathy Boyle, principal analyst for mobile at eMarketer, a research firm.\nCreating an iPhone app typically costs $50,000 to $200,000, and some cost as much as $1 million, according to an eMarketer report last June. A website is cheaper, and while it lacks some convenience of an app, there are techniques to make a site easy for web users to find.\n\u201cDevelopers are asking, \u2018What is the additional revenue I can get from an app?\u2019\u201d Ms. Boyle said."

        "title": "Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence.\nNew rules issued by the Indian government on Mondayexempt foreign-owned companies that want to open stores selling a single brand of products from requirements that 30 percent of the content of those products come from India. The exemption, which lasts three years, can be extended to eight years in the case of companies selling\u201ccutting edge\u201d items, such as Apple\u2019s iPhones and Macs.\nApple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores.\nBy themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple\u2019s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.\nApple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.\nThe policy changes, which also affect other sectors like the military and aviation, are the latest effort by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make India more predictable for foreign technology companies \u2014 even if the rules do not always work exactly as planned.\nIn March, the governmentdeclared that online retailers that sell many brands, including Amazon, are legal under Indian law, which had been a gray area. However, it also said that such retailers could not sell goods directly to consumers, but instead must serve as marketplaces for third-party merchants. That threatened to upend the business structure of Amazon as well as local competitors likeFlipkartwhile protecting local merchants.\nLast month, after years of threatening to impose stiff taxes on venture capitalists and other foreign investors in India, the Indian government struck a new treaty with Mauritius, a tax haven used by many foreign companies to move money in and out of India tax-free, to phase out the tax breaks. Foreign investors will soon have to pay a modest tax on capital gains in India, but the uncertainty is over.\nKanwal Rekhi, managing director of Inventus Capital Partners, a venture capital firm with a long history of investing in India, said the series of clarifications had been a long time in coming. \u201cThese are not things that require change of law,\u201d he said. \u201cModi is an improvement over what we had, but he is still hesitant.\u201d\nMr. Rehki said that Monday\u2019s policy announcements would have little impact on the overall technology industry in India, which is already open to start-ups as well as giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oracle.\nBut it will certainly help Apple open its first stores in the country. Analysts said the new rules effectively would give Apple \u2014 as well as major Chinese phonemakers likeXiaomiandLenovo\u2014 the ability to set up shops in India to showcase their wares.\nOpening stores will allow Apple to deliver to Indian customers the full Apple experience \u2014 artful displays staffed by informed sales representatives, \u201cgenius bars\u201d to help solve problems and a carefully curated set of accessories.\n\u201cPeople feel pride after buying an iPhone, that\u2019s what Apple is all about,\u201d said Anshul Gupta, a personal technology analyst with Gartner in Mumbai. \u201cThat\u2019s how they maintain the premium image.\u201d\nThe Indian government has not yet acted on Apple\u2019s request to address the low end of the market by importing and selling used phones with a new warranty. The company has indicated it would do some of the refurbishing in India, creating local jobs.\nMr. Gupta said that Indian consumers were becoming more affluent, and that if Apple could capture the top 5 to 10 percent of India\u2019s smartphone sales, that would be a large new market. \u201cIt is not an overnight story, but there is a huge potential,\u201d he said.\nApple is making other commitments to India. During Mr. Cook\u2019s visit, he announced the tech giant would be opening anew development center in Hyderabad, focused on map technology, that would create up to 4,000 jobs. The company also opened atech accelerator in Bangaloreto encourage more local app developers to write software for Apple products.\nApple, slow to warm to India, \u201cnow wants to catch up its lost ground, \u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of Technopak, a business consulting firm in New Delhi."

        "fulltext": "Virtual reality is all fun and games, until your avatar gets strip-searched at the border.\nThings haven\u2019t gone that far yet, but it might be time to get ready. AsFarhad Manjoo reports, the biggest American technology companies appear to be headed for a global clash with governments that want to curb their practices.\nThe most familiar controls have to do with the storage and movement of personal data, whichcompelledAmazon to build data centers in Germany to abide with laws on keeping personal information inside that country. At the time, an Amazon executive called German law \u201ca form of customer demand.\u201d\nNew types of control go into things like perhaps compelling Netflix to offer local content in Europe and forbidding Facebook to provide a limited type of free internet access and refusing Apple\u2019s attempt atselling refurbished iPhonesin India.\nThe Indian government wants smartphones that have30 percent local parts, but the big global conflict here is equally about the way that technology is now overtly steering culture, something nations often protect as vigorously as their borders.\nThat is ironically fitting. As the lateBenedict Andersonpointed out, the nation-state came about as a result of technology: The printing press created the mass market of vernacular literature, including (thanks to the likes of Martin Luther, the first best-selling writer) translations of the Holy Bible. Marketing directly to speakers of French, English and German created a new kind of language and cultural consciousness that hadn\u2019t existed before. Over time, that turned into the ideas of a nation and a people. No Gutenberg, no nations.\nThe new borderless technologies appear to be having much the same effect, at lightning speed. Bitcoin, the currency backed by no government,creates a beliefin a kind of transnational society of Bitcoin holders.Google Translatecollapses the barrier of language, so a Finnish and a Chinese speaker can converse with just a smartphone between them. Facebook\u2019s10-year planto put enough bandwidth in the world for virtual reality anywhere indicates that even cultural gestures will be shared with everyone.\nAt first pass, the spread of these seemingly limitless freedoms seems akin to the spread of American products like Hollywood movies and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll across much of the world (much to the consternation of many governmental, cultural and religious leaders.) Or maybe they seem like the less-remarked-on spread of Western democratic tropes after World War II, so that even a totalitarian state like North Korea holds sham elections to declare its government the people\u2019s will.\nThat seems to be the case, since places like Europe worry about the big computers of Google and Amazon, but not so much about similarly sized systems inside the Chinese giants Alibaba and Tencent. The Chinese companies tend to stay inside China.\nIn fact, it may be something newer and more threatening to the state: the triumph not of American values but of algorithmic ones, designed to engage the largest audience, to understand the most about a person and to infer the greatest number of patterns in nature and society in order to exploit them.\nFor now, one or another intelligence agency may snoop on an American tech company\u2019s findings, but asthe recent Apple-F.B.I. conflictshows, that doesn\u2019t mean interests are allied anymore.\nThere is no allegiance to any government, perhaps, but to something we don\u2019t yet understand. It could be maximizing scientific discovery or ensuring the most consumer pleasure, or connecting with people who matter most. Big as they are, the new systems are still only partly built out.\nEven the chief executives at the biggest of them don\u2019t know where all this will lead, any more than Gutenberg could have foreseen Martin Luther and the nation-state."

        "fulltext": "It was the Apple Store in New York City before there was such a thing as an Apple Store.\nBefore iPods and iPads and iPhones, before Apple started selling and servicing its devices out of a glass cube on Fifth Avenue, the eclectic Tekserve store on West 23rd Street in Manhattan was where customers went for upgrades to their PowerBook laptops or to have their computers fixed.\nBut times have changed, Tekserve\u2019s managers said, and on Wednesday, they announced that the company was closing its retail and customer-service operation. The service center will remain open until July 31, and the retail store will close on Aug. 15. About 70 employees will lose their jobs, the company said.\n\u201cThis is a cultural shift,\u201d the company\u2019s chief executive, Jerry Gepner, said in an interview in his office above the store. \u201cIt\u2019s not a failure of the business. It\u2019s like this giant wave finally crashed down upon us.\u201d\nTekserve found its niche in an era when Apple had a much smaller slice of the computer market. Among many of Tekserve\u2019s customers then, Apple computers had a devoted following. \u201cIt was the cult of Mac,\u201d said Mr. Gepner, who, before running Tekserve, was a regular customer.\nHe said that customers had gravitated to Tekserve to buy Apple computers, have them serviced or have questions about them answered at a time when computers were more cumbersome to use and help was not simply a Google search away. \u201cIt was also a gathering place,\u201d Mr. Gepner said, \u201cwhere knowledge was shared.\u201d\nTekserve opened in 1987, focusing exclusively on repairs at first, and has always operated out of spaces on 23rd Street, between Sixth and Seventh Avenues. More than 15 years ago, it moved into its current home, with 10,000 square feet of retail and service space, and grew into something of a New York City fixture. On \u201cSex and the City,\u201d for instance, when Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s laptop crashed, sherushed to Tekserve.\nWhile Apple\u2019s own stores are sleek and modern in appearance, Tekserve had the feel of a throwback, its shelves lined with old-fashioned radios and a soda machine where customers could grab a chilled Coca-Cola in a glass bottle. There was also a \u201cmuseum\u201d of Apple computers, with models dating back more than three decades, including a Macintosh 128K \u2014 the original Apple Macintosh personal computer \u2014 signed by Stephen Wozniak, the company\u2019s co-founder.\nThese days, though, Apple has six stores in Manhattan, including one in Chelsea, not far from Tekserve. There is also a Best Buy store just on the other side of Sixth Avenue from Tekserve. And then there are the options online.\nResellers like Tekserve, once among the few places where customers could get Apple products, have been the victims of the technology company\u2019s growth. But also, Tekserve said in a statement, swiftly rising rent has not helped.\nMr. Gepner said that when he joined Tekserve in 2014, the owners asked him to see whether the diminishing retail operation could be saved. But, he said, the owners realized that a turnaround seemed unlikely. \u201cFor us,\u201d he said, \u201cthe trend wasn\u2019t going to reverse.\u201d\nTalk of the store\u2019s closing had circulated for weeks among neighbors and regular customers. Employees were officially told on Wednesday that the end was imminent.\n\u201cWe love our customers, and we love what we do,\u201d Mr. Gepner said. \u201cBut there comes a point where that doesn\u2019t make sense anymore, as much as we love it.\u201d\nThe company will continue with its corporate sales and professional services, as well as with an operation focused on small- and medium-size businesses, an area that has experienced growth, Mr. Gepner said.\nOutside the store on Wednesday afternoon, word had not yet reached many customers, who said they were disappointed. Alan Wolk said he had been coming to Tekserve for about 15 years, including once to repair a keyboard damaged by spilled coffee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been here forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys, they know their stuff. You can trust them.\u201d\nKerry Elson said she first came to Tekserve about a decade ago, when she was still working as an intern and trying to figure out how to use a new computer. She kept coming because she trusted those who worked there.\n\u201cI feel like this is my go-to,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seemed like they were on your side.\u201d"

Trump, two people briefed on the company\u2019s decision said on Saturday.\nApple is the latest in a string of companies dropping out as sponsors of the Republican convention. Few have attributed their decisions directly to Mr. Trump, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee, but some have privately expressed worries about having their products associated with the candidate and his ideas.\nOfficials at Apple declined to comment Saturday. But the company\u2019s move,first reportedby Politico, was relayed to Republican officials and was described by two people briefed on the decision, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump\u2019s because of the company\u2019s use of Chinese manufacturing and its fight with the United States government over the encryption of data on its smartphones. One of those briefed on Apple\u2019s decision said the company objected not only to beliefs Mr. Trump has expressed on trade with China and data encryption, but also to his comments about Muslims and immigrants.\nMr. Trump has promised to build a wall along the nation\u2019s border with Mexico, has characterized Mexican immigrants as criminals and has vowed to stop immigration from Muslim-dominated countries as a counterterrorism strategy.\nAsked to comment on Apple\u2019s decision, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee said, \u201cWe are working with a variety of major tech partners who are focused on being part of the American political process.\u201d\nApple\u2019s withdrawal is not by itself a large blow to the convention. It typically donates equipment; its contribution in 2008, for example, was valued at $140,000, according to federal election records. But it adds to the parade of major companies, including HP and Microsoft, curtailing or eliminating their monetary support of the Republican convention.\nLast week, Bloomberg Politics reported that JPMorgan Chase and Ford Motor would not sponsor the convention.\nApple was still expected to provide support for the Democratic convention, though it was unclear Saturday if that decision was final.\nFor months, activist groupshave put pressureon companies to steer clear of the Republican convention, where Mr. Trump is expected to officially become the party\u2019s leader.\nSome major technology firms, such as Google, are still planning to support the convention in some fashion.\nMr. Trump\u2019s presence at the top of the Republican ticket has created a seismic split within his party \u2014 among down-ballot candidates, who do not want to answer to his frequent controversies, and among donors, many of whom do not want to fund the party as heavily as they have in the past. Last week, Speaker Paul D. Ryan said that his endorsement of Mr. Trump was not a \u201cblank check\u201d and that he could rescind it.\nOn Saturday, Mr. Trump cited the lack of support among other Republicans and took an unusual tack, threatening to stop raising money for the party and to self-fund his race.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to beat Hillary, and it would helpful if the Republicans could help us a little bit,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Las Vegas, referring to Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee. He continued to criticize his party: \u201cI am raising a lot of money for the Republican Party, and there are a lot of beneficiaries of that. And I like doing it. But we have to have help.\u201d\nThe Trump campaign is relying heavily on the Republican Party apparatus to support his candidacy, in particular its field and data programs across the country, since he keeps a lean staff. Self-funding would require Mr. Trump to put up hundreds of millions of dollars, something he resisted for much of the primary race.\n\u201cIf the Republican Party, and I hope they all come together, because I want them to all come together, but if for any reason, they get a little bit like they don\u2019t want to help out as much, then I\u2019ll fund my own campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "At last week\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple\u2019s annual showcase of new tech, the companyannounceda special texting feature coming soon to iPhones near you.\n\u201cYou know, sometimes you\u2019ve typed a whole message and you realize at the end that you\u2019re entirely lacking in emojification,\u201d said Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for software engineering. \u201cSo we provided the solution: When you tap on the emoji button, we\u2019ll highlight all the emojifiable words there, and you can just tap, tap, tap, tap and emojify.\u201d\nOn a screen behind Mr. Federighi, a simulated message underwent the process: The word \u201cbasketball\u201d transformed into a little black and orange cartoon image of the ball itself. \u201cPizza\u201d flipped into a glistening pepperoni slice. \u201cMovie\u201d turned into an old-school film camera. A collective\u201cOoh\u201d wafted up from the technorati gathered in the crowd.\n\u201cChildren of tomorrow will have no understanding of the English language,\u201d Mr. Federighi said jokingly.\nBut Apple\u2019s new emoji feature seems more likely to impede a different kind of skill: creating surprising, figurative and subversive forms of individual expression out of the digital ephemera that populate our devices. In a rush to harness the power of the web\u2019s most evocative cultural units \u2014 emoji and their hyperactive cousins, GIFs \u2014 tech companies, corporate brands and entrepreneurial social media stars could risk inadvertently flattening the creative world that\u2019s sprung up around them.\n\u201cThere is a constant push and pull between people finding new ways to express themselves online, and companies trying to make money off that expression,\u201d saidLuke Stark, who studies digital communication and psychology.\nEmoji have emerged as cultural forces in and of themselves. The crisp, candy-colored glyphs form a modern emotional palette. And it\u2019s growing: On Tuesday, theUnicode Consortium, the body that standardizes emoji, will release72 new onesthat will soon make their way to our fingertips, including ablack heart, awilted flowerand apregnant woman.\nEmoji began as colorful icons loaded into Japanese pagers in the 1990s. When they first migrated to American devices several years ago, discovering emoji felt like opening a grab bag ofJapanese curios: smiley faces, yes, but also a buffet of Japanese foods (a cut of sashimi, a fish cake, a bottle of sake) and a host of untranslatable images.\nBut the emoji soon took on new meanings as they made their way to new countries and subcultures \u2014 like theinformation desk personemoji (recast as a sassy retort), or theeggplant emoji(which usurped the banana to become the internet\u2019s favorite phallic symbol). In a group chat, adding emoji can feel like tacking up posters on the walls of a virtual clubhouse. A lively sequence can stoke flirtatious undertones or show off sparkling wit. One perfectly chosen emoji could suspend a mood in time, like an \u201980s movie that ends on an exultant freeze frame.\nIf emoji encourage visual puns and whimsical juxtapositions, GIFs inspire a sharp curatorial sensibility. The art lies in detecting the richest slices of popular media \u2014 film, TV or amateur video \u2014 and punctuating their greatness by setting them on infinite repeat. The best \u201creaction\u201d GIFs \u2014 those chosen to inject human expression in online conversation \u2014 feel both emotionally familiar and visually surprising.\nBut when emojis and GIFs are filtered through the interests of tech companies, they often become slickly automated. In addition to Apple\u2019s \u201cemojification\u201d feature, there is Twitter\u2019s new GIF keyboard (a partnership with the GIF companyGiphy, which has been pumped with $78.95 million worth of funding since 2013). It directs Twitter users to choose from a suite of emotional reactions, including \u201cAgree,\u201d \u201cApplause,\u201d \u201cAww\u201d and \u201cEww,\u201d which conjures a set of appropriate GIFs, front-loaded with those featuring the internet\u2019s most GIFable celebrities, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Oprah.\nSearching for a delicious bite of pop culture once took on the contours of a treasure hunt. A GIF keyboard feels like a shortcut: Click \u201cGIF,\u201d find an emotional state (\u201cAgree\u201d), then filter it through your cultural lens of choice (like Jerry Seinfeld saying \u201criiiiiight right right right right right.\u201d). Tap, tap, tap: GIF-ify.\nIt all feels simpatico with Facebook\u2019s new \u201creactions,\u201d released in February, which offer users a slim range of human experiences \u2014Anger, Sad, Wow, HahaandLove\u2014 with which to react to news on their feed.\nBuying into these features means giving tech companies the power to shape our creative expressions in ways that further enrich the companies themselves. A limited emotional range helps collect data on users\u2019 states of mind. Twitter advertisers can now target users based on the emoji they tweet.\nThe commodification of digital culture has engendered more explicit corporate branding, too. On Snapchat, where users embellish their selfies with emoji, crayon scribbles, and elaborate \u201clenses\u201d that cover their faces with virtual masks, marketers like McDonalds are seizing the opportunity to write their messages across people\u2019s faces.\nEven celebrities have tried to encode themselves. In December, Kim Kardashian-West released her latest pioneering app,Kimoji, which serves up an alternative emoji set (and a suite of GIFs) designed around her own image. It inspired a boomlet of celebrity emoji offerings, including Stephen Curry\u2019sStephMojiapp, Amber Rose\u2019sMuvaMoji, Justin Bieber\u2019sJustmojiand the actor Ansel Elgort\u2019sAnselfie. EvenDrake\u2019s dadhas emoji now.\nWith Kimoji, and its micro images of breasts and butts, Kim Kardashian isn\u2019t just sexy: She represents sex itself. But as more stars jump on the bandwagon, these apps begin to represent little more than a branding opportunity: Ansel Elgort sticking out his tongue; Ansel Elgort pouting; Ansel Elgort wearing headphones.\nMeanwhile, as traditional emoji expand beyond their Japanese roots, tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google (all are voting members of Unicode) have become responsible for making cultural, and sometimes political, choices in determining which new emoji will make the cut.\nSome additions to the emoji repertoire are informed by experts: Unicode hasconsultedthe Cornell Lab of Ornithology for bird emoji advice. Others areculled from\u201cpopular requests from online communities\u201d and proposals submitted by the public.\nCompanies have also made bids to influence the result, though Unicode says it rejects emojis \u201cstrongly associated with a particular brand.\u201d Last year, the ad agency Havas London started a campaign on behalf of Durex, calling for a condom emoji. Cerveza Indio wants adark beer emoji. Ballantine\u2019s haschampioneda glass of whiskey. The rice company La Fallera suggested apaella emoji. (The whiskey and paella made the cut; both are coming on Tuesday.)\nFor the Olympics, Unicode recently considered encoding a rifle emoji alongside other sport-themed glyphs, but members voted it down. \u201cWhen vendors looked at it, they didn\u2019t see a lot of additional value in adding it,\u201d said Mark Davis, a Unicode spokesman. \u201cThere\u2019s already a firearm in Unicode.\u201d\nThat decision has helpedstoke concernsthat modern visual language is being shaped by the political or financial priorities of gigantic tech companies. While many don\u2019t see the advantage of emojifying another gun, others wonder whether heightened scrutiny could lead to less idiosyncratic, less interesting characters.\n\u201cOne of the things that make emoji fun is this quirky weird list that came about through accidents of history,\u201d said Jeremy Burge, the founder of Emojipedia and a member of Unicode\u2019s emoji subcommittee. \u201cThe bomb, the cigarette, the dripping syringe \u2014 it\u2019s crazy to think that all of those would make it in today.\u201d"

        "title": "Zen and the Art of Managing Smartphone Photos",
        "fulltext": "If your digital photos are a mirror of your life, they may also serve as a reminder that there is only so much you can control and that at some point you just need to let things go.\nThat was the lesson I learned after trying to create a step-by-step guide to organizing and storing smartphone photos, based on interviews with professional photographers and a week of testing multiple photo-management services and gadgets.\nI spent days experimenting with neurotic tagging systems, tedious backup processes and album management, and finally turned to Brian Christian, a computer scientist and philosopher, for advice.\nThe healthiest approach to managing photos, it turns out, is a Zen one: to not deal with them much at all.\nMr. Christian said photo organization illustrates a computer-science principle known as the search-sort trade-off. If you spend tons of time rummaging for a specific photo, then sorting photos may be worthwhile. But if you hunt for a picture infrequently, sorting may be a waste of time.\n\u201cIf it would take you eight hours to tag all your friends, you should not undertake that until you\u2019ve already wasted eight hours digging up photos of your friends,\u201d said Mr. Christian, co-author of \u201cAlgorithms to Live By,\u201d a book about using algorithmic principles to improve your life.\nIn other words, people need a photo-organization method that saves time \u2014 and that allows them to essentially throw out the need to sort and tag their enormous photo sprawl. So I tried several photo-management services and devices to determine what that method might be.\nOver a week, I tested three backup services with my iPhone photo library of about 8,000 images: Apple\u2019s iCloud photo library, Dropbox and Google Photos, which automatically take your photos and store them in the cloud. I also tested two data backup devices from SanDisk and Synology.\nMy conclusion: For smartphone shooters, the secret to photo nirvana is to take a deep breath and let Google back up and organize everything.\nApple\u2019s iCloud was straightforward. In the iPhone\u2019s camera settings, flipping oniCloud Photo Libraryuploads all your photos to iCloud, which is accessible by Apple and Windows devices. Dropbox\u2019s photo-backup service uploads photos to your Dropbox folder, which is compatible with various devices like Windows PCs, iPhones and Android phones. ForGoogle Photos, as soon as you set up the app, it starts backing everything up in Google\u2019s cloud service called Drive, also accessible on various devices. All three services took several days to back up my entire library over a Wi-Fi connection while I was asleep.\nGoogle Photos quickly set itself apart with its smarter auto-sorting features. It scans your photos and organizes them in several ways. For one, it can detect the face of a person and group all the photos of that person into an album, which you can name. With photos taken within a short time span, like your trip to a beach over the weekend, Google Photos might create a video montage or an album with a label like \u201cA weekend in San Francisco.\u201d The service also managed to identify pictures of items, like receipts and food, and group them into their own albums with labels.\nDropbox and Apple\u2019s photo services had auto-organizing features, but not the smarts of Google\u2019s service. Apple\u2019s app groups photos into collections based on when and where photos were taken; it can also organize photos by faces, similar to Google. Dropbox uploads photos into a folder labeled Camera Uploads and labels each file by the date and time it was taken.\nAnother benefit of Google Photos is its free offering is the most generous \u2014 enough to let you try out the service thoroughly before deciding whether to pay. The service offers to store an unlimited number of compressed images at no cost. For full-resolution images, you get 15 gigabytes of free storage and can pay at least $2 a month for 100 gigs.\nIn contrast, Apple offers five gigabytes free and thereafter charges at least $1 a month for 50 gigs; Dropbox offers two gigabytes of free storage before charging at least $10 a month for a terabyte.\nAnil Sabharwal, vice president of Google Photos, said the company built Google Photos to make it easy to keep, manage and share photos and videos. Apple and Dropbox did not immediately have comment.\nI also tested two physical devices for managing photos: theSanDisk iXpand, a small drive that plugs directly into the power port of an iPhone and automatically backs up photos, and Synology\u2019s DS216+II, a new disk storage system that connects to your internet at home to create a personal cloud.\nThe iXpand device was deeply flawed \u2014 it tried to back up all my photos for six hours before the iPhone ran out of battery and the backup failed entirely. Synology\u2019s photo-management software backed up my photos quickly and had some features like face and location tagging, but organizing photo albums still required lots of manual labor.\nSanDisk said the issue I experienced was a known problem affecting a small number of devices and that an app update would be released next week to fix the bug. A Synology spokeswoman said that with its network-attached storage systems, customers could back up a broad array of media on a private cloud.\nIn the end, Google Photos solves multiple problems: It handles organization, making the search-sort trade-off minimal. It creates a backup of photos, so you can free up space on your smartphone while safeguarding pictures in case the device is lost or stolen.\nOnce all your photos are on Google Photos, they need not live on the phone. Unfortunately, there is no quick way to delete thousands of photos. I plugged my iPhone into a Mac, imported my older photos and checked the box that says \u201cDelete items after import.\u201d Then I deleted them all from the computer. (In the future, it will be easier to delete smaller batches straight off the phone.)\nWhat about blurry, unwanted images? The most important lesson of Google Photos is to stop thinking of the digital photo album like a physical scrapbook. With a traditional photo album, you would spend time flipping through pages before landing on the right photo.\nWith Google Photos, you can treat it like a giant searchable junk drawer: You can simply open the Google Photos app or Google Drive, type in a keyword for what you want to see, pull up that photo and ignore everything else. You can make some changes here and there \u2014 like renaming or adding photos to albums \u2014 but otherwise, why bother?\nOne caveat: The Zen approach does not apply to those with professional cameras. For professional photographers, some organization is a plus and Google Photos and cloud services are not ideal because large photos would take too long to upload.\nBen Long, a professional photographer in San Francisco, said he diligently tagged his photos with keywords usingAdobe\u2019s Lightroom appto make them easy to find later.\n\u201cI put tagging up there with flossing and stretching: things you know you\u2019re supposed to do and they\u2019re really a drag to do, but you just get in the habit of it,\u201d he said.\nFor the rest of us, there\u2019s another reason to not bother deleting photos in Google Photos: Google adds creative touches to images that you thought were previously unwanted. If you took multiple shots of a sun setting or your child smiling, for example, it stitches them into an animation.\n\u201cThe lower the cost is of searching, then the more one should ask the question of, should I be organizing this at all?\u201d Mr. Christian said.\nAfter migrating my entire photo library to Google Photos, my answer is a resounding no."

        "fulltext": "Q.The thought ofransomware aimed at the Macmakes me nervous. What other Mac threats are out there and who makes OS X antivirus software?\nA.While generally much less of a target than the Windows operating system, Apple\u2019s OS X system for the Mac has experienced a few dedicated attacks from malicious software over the past several years, includingFlashbackandXcodeghost. Keeping your Mac updated with the latest security patches from Apple and using strong passwords (that are frequently changed) can help protect your system.\nIn addition to offering its ownsuggestions for safer computingto Mac users, Apple promotes thesecurity features it builds into OS X, includingmalware detectionand the ability to encrypt data with theFileVaulttool. To avoidmalware, the company alsoadvises users to install software from the Mac App Storeor other trusted sources only.\nFor another layer of protection, adding a security suite or antivirus program could help detect threats that may emerge against the Mac. Depending on what you want and how much you want to pay, you can find free basic virus scanner programs as well as comprehensive security suites.\nIndependent software evaluation sites likeAV-TestandAV Comparativesdo annual reviews of most major security programs for the Mac, and are a good place to start reading about what products are available.Avria,Avast Software,BitDefender(which also has afree Virus Scanner app),IntegoandMalwarebytesare among the increasing number of companies now making Mac security software.\nHowever, keep in mind that many security problems for OS X and Windows start withphishingand other forms of social engineering attacks.
