        "title": "Apple Says It Has Fixed FaceTime Security Bug",
        "fulltext": "Apple said Friday that it had fixeda security flaw in iPhonesthat allowed people to call another iPhone via FaceTime and listen in on conversations even if the recipient didn\u2019t answer, resolving an alarming vulnerability that undermined the company\u2019s public commitment to security. A software update will be released next week, the company said.\nThe new update will allow owners of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers to re-enable Group FaceTime, the feature that had allowed the potential eavesdropping, Apple said. (Instructions on how to update a device\u2019s software are below.)\nApple\u2019s response came four days after the flaw was widely reported, and nearly two weeks sincea concerned customeralerted the company. This week, before fixing the bug, the company raced to disable Group FaceTime, which allows people to video chat with several people.\nA 14-year-old Arizona boy discovered that he could listen to a friend via Group FaceTime on Jan. 19, even if the friend didn\u2019t answer the call. His mother repeatedly tried to flag the issue to Apple, but the company was slow to respond.\n\u201cWe want to assure our customers that as soon as our engineering team became aware of the details necessary to reproduce the bug, they quickly disabled Group FaceTime and began work on the fix,\u201d an Apple spokesman said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe are committed to improving the process by which we receive and escalate these reports, in order to get them to the right people as fast as possible.\u201d\nThe incident was embarrassing for a company that regularly boasts about the safety of its products. Hours before Apple publicly acknowledged the bug \u2014 branded \u201cFacePalm\u201d by security researchers \u2014 on Monday, Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, tweeted that \u201cwe all must insist on action and reform for vital privacy protections.\u201d\nAfter the vulnerability became public, security researchers and politicians raised concerns about the security of Apple\u2019s products. To pre-empt security attacks, in 2016 Apple started offering hackers a $200,000 bounty if they flagged bugs to the company. But some hackers have said the program has had a slow start because they can make more money selling the flaws on the black market.\nTo install the update when it is released, follow these steps for iPhones, iPads and Macs:\n\u25a0 On an iPhone or an iPad, open the Settings app, then tap General and then tap Software Update. From here, download the newest iOS version, which is expected to be called 12.1.4. When the update is ready, choose Install Now. As a precaution, make sure your iPhone or iPad is plugged into a power source when installing the update.\n\u25a0 On a Mac, open the App Store app. Then click the Updates tab, and click Update next to MacOS Mojave. (If you are using an older version of the Mac operating system, you will not see this option and do not need to download the update.) When the download is finished, make sure your power cable is plugged in and restart the computer."

        "title": "Big Investors Shed Tech Stocks as Markets Tumbled Last Quarter",
        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nBets on Big Tech became, in Wall Street parlance, crowded last year.\nThe belief that shares of the world\u2019s tech giants \u2014 Alibaba, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Baidu, Facebook, Netflix and Tencent \u2014 would continue to rise became universally popular among some of the biggest names in investing.\nLast quarter, sentiment reversed, and those same investors dumped their shares.\nInvestment firms run by George Soros and David Tepper unloaded their shares of Apple during the fourth quarter, according to filings Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The hedge fund Jana Partners also reduced its stake in the iPhone maker last quarter.\nEven Berkshire Hathaway, which has spent the past three years gobbling up shares of Apple, cut back its holdings in the company.\nAnd Apple was not the only tech titan that big investors were selling last quarter.\nJana, along with Third Point, sold all its shares in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Third Point exited its position in Netflix. Leon Cooperman\u2019s firm, Omega Advisors, sold its stake in Facebook and reduced its holdings in Alphabet. And Tiger Global Management decreased its holdings in Amazon.\nThe filings are the latest evidence of how quickly investors soured on Big Tech late last year as the industry\u2019s woes mounted. A stream of revelations about privacy lapses and security issues had raised the specter of increased regulation on both sides of the Atlantic. But of more immediate concern for investors late last year was whether these companies could continue to grow amid a slowing global economy and an escalating trade war between China and the United States.\nOver the final three months of last year, tech shares dropped 13 percent to 30 percent, erasing more than $1 trillion in market value. By comparison, the S&P 500 fell 14 percent.\nThe selling signaled a swift shift in sentiment among big hedge funds. Many of these fund managers had struggled to beat the broader market in recent years. So as tech stocks soared and drove much of the broader market\u2019s gains, hedge funds crammed their portfolios with their shares.\nThe selling caught the hedge fund industry off guard, and their losses mounted during the fourth-quarter tumult in the stock market.\nSo far this year, shares of the tech companies have recovered, but most have not fared as well as the S&P 500.\nEarnings for the final three months of 2018 were better than investors feared, but they did not inspire confidence that Big Tech would weather a global economic slowdown well, particularly in China.\nWhether investors will pile back into tech stocks will probably depend on the outcome of trade talks between China and the United States. Until then, many investors may stay on the sidelines."

        "title": "Apple and Google Urged to Dump Saudi App That Lets Men Track Women",
        "fulltext": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 A Saudi mobile application that lets men track and restrict the movements of women in the kingdom has come under increased scrutiny this week with an American senator and rights groups urging Apple and Google to remove it from their platforms, accusing the technology giants of facilitating gender discrimination.\nSaudi\u201cguardianship laws\u201dgive women a legal status similar to that of minors in many areas of their lives. Every Saudi woman, regardless of age, has a male \u201cguardian,\u201d usually her father or husband, but sometimes her brother or son, who must give his permission for her to get a passport, have certain medical procedures or get married.\nThe app in question, called Absher, was launched in 2015 by the Saudi government. It allows men to manage the women under their guardianship by giving or revoking their right to travel through airports, tracking them by their national identity cards or passports. The men can turn on notifications that alert them with a text message any time a woman under their guardianship passes through an airport.\nAbsher, which roughly translates as \u201cyes sir,\u201d can be downloaded from both theGoogle Play storeandApple\u2019s app store, which critics say makes the tech companies complicit in the repression of Saudi women.\nThe effort to pull Absher from the platforms got a boost this week when Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, demanded as much in a letter to the two companies.\n\u201cIt is hardly news that the Saudi monarchy seeks to restrict and repress Saudi women, but American companies should not enable or facilitate the Saudi government\u2019s patriarchy,\u201d Mr. Wyden wrote in theletter, which was released on Monday.\nAddressing Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executive officers of Apple and Google, Mr. Wyden said the companies were \u201cmaking it easier for Saudi men to control their family members from the convenience of their smartphones and restrict their movement.\u201d\nHe requested that they prevent their companies from \u201cbeing used by the Saudi government to enable the abhorrent surveillance and control of women.\u201d\nRepresentatives of Apple and the Saudi government did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Google spokesman confirmed that the company is assessing the app to determine if it is in accordance with its policies.\nSaudi Arabia has one of the world\u2019s most restrictive environments for women, although the country\u2019s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has pushed to loosen some constraints since his father, King Salman, ascended the throne in 2015.\nSince then, the kingdom has eased restrictions on women\u2019s dress, expanded the range of fields for women in the work force and begun offering physical education classes for girls in government schools. Last year, Saudi Arabia lifted alongstanding ban on female drivers, a move hailed as a major milestone.\nBut critics say that Saudi women cannot achieve equality as long as the kingdom maintains its guardianship laws. Saudi officials argue that such restrictions are rooted in their culture and supported by many in the kingdom.\nWhen asked about the issuein an interview last year, Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia had to \u201cfigure out a way to treat this that doesn\u2019t harm families and doesn\u2019t harm the culture.\u201d\nAbsher, which can be used by Saudi nationals and residents of the kingdom, more broadly is an online portal where both men and women can access a range of government services, from paying traffic tickets to applying for new identification cards. The controls on women are just one of its functions.\nThe repression of Saudi women jumped into the headlines last month when an 18-year-old Saudi, Rahaf Alqunun,barricaded herself in a hotel roomin the Bangkok airport to avoid being returned to her family. She had slipped away from her family during a holiday in Kuwait and boarded a plane for Thailand, but was stopped in the airport. She was later granted asylum in Canada.\nAnother Saudi woman who hadfled the kingdomfor Australia described covertly using her father\u2019s phone to access Absher and give herself permission to travel, allowing her to leave the country undetected.\nHuman rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have long campaigned for guardianship laws to be repealed, but the targeting of Absher and its availability on Western tech platforms is new.\nHala Aldosary, a Saudi scholar and activist based in the United States, said that the removal of the app by Apple and Google could send an important message to leaders like Prince Mohammed, who have sought out partnerships with global tech firms in efforts to enhance their economies.\n\u201cIf the tech companies would say, \u2018You are being oppressive,\u2019 that would mean a lot,\u201d Ms. Aldosary said.\nBut removing the app would not get rid of the country\u2019s guardianship laws, she said, and men could still change their female relatives\u2019 status online or in government offices.\n\u201cThe app is a means to an end, but it is not the end,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it does make the lives of guardians easier.\u201d\nWhen asked about Absher inan interview with National Public Radioon Monday, Mr. Cook of Apple said he had not heard of it.\n\u201cBut obviously we\u2019ll take a look at it if that\u2019s the case,\u201d he said.\nBut both companies have responded to similar campaigns to remove apps.\nIn December, Apple removed a religious app from its online store that portrayed being gay as \u201ca sickness\u201d and \u201ca sin\u201d after a gay rights group campaigned against it,NBC News reported."

        "title": "Big Tech Is No Longer Carrying the Stock Market",
        "fulltext": "One by one, the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded.\nFears that the United States economy would dip into a recessionthis yearhave eased. The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future, and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade war.\nBut if the January snap back (it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades, after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period) is to sustain itself, big technology companies likely will have to lead the way.\nSo far this year, they have not done that.\nFor much of the past decade, the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies: Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the next.\nBy the end of August, their sway over the direction of the S&P 500 exceeded all but two of the index\u2019s 11 sector groupings. As the index pushed to a record high last summer, the rise in those six companies\u2019 shares accounted for half of its gain. They led on the way down too, dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of 2018 and nearly ending the longest bull market on record.\nSo it\u2019s notable, then, that as the S&P 500 rallied nearly 8 percent in January, the big technology stocks accounted for just 17 percent of the benchmark\u2019s rise, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nWhat happened?\nThe companies have faced a fundamental question since late last year: Could they continue to pull in new users and generate more sales in a slowing global economy? Sales growth had begun to slow in the second half of 2018 and earnings updates in January haven\u2019t fully resolved investors\u2019 concerns about their trajectory.\n\u201cThis is the first quarter in my memory that technology has on the whole had worse metrics than the S&P 500,\u201d said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, referring to the earnings and revenue growth rate of big technology companies.\nAfter Applewarned of diminishing demandfor new iPhones in China earlier this year, its forecast for the current quarter wasn\u2019t as dire as many on Wall Street had feared. The stock has gained 7.7 percent since then. Still, the iPhone maker reported a 15 percent drop in revenue, including a 27 percent decline in China, and its results indicated a difficult road ahead. Its stock remains nearly 30 percent below its peak.\nAmazonreported record profits and revenue. But its shares were down 5.4 percent Friday in part because revenue from online shopping slowed and the growth of Prime memberships appeared to have plateaued.\nMicrosoft shares have fallen 3.4 percent since it reported on Wednesday. Revenue at the software giant has surged in recent years as its bet on cloud computing has paid off, but therewere continued signsthat that acceleration could be tapering off.\nFacebook, whose shares were the most battered among the big tech companies last year, was perhaps the bright spot this earnings season. Despite a string of scandals, the social network generated record revenue and profit last year. Its shares have jumped 10.5 percent since Wednesday.\nNetflix also said revenue would grow more slowly this quarter. Its stock is down almost 3.8 percent since it reported on Jan. 17.\nThere is a big caveat to all the hand-wringing about slowing growth:All five companies still generate huge revenue. And should Beijing and Washington reach an agreement in the trade war, sales could pick up if the global economy, particularly China\u2019s, begins to gain speed.\n\u201cThere was real concern that tech was the canary in the coal mine of what would be a very dark 2019,\u201d said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities covering technology companies. \u201cThus far a lot of those fears are proving overblown. That could set the stage for tech to make new highs this year, depending on what happens with China.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Stands Up for Privacy. Does It Matter?",
        "fulltext": "The ongoing tension between Apple and Facebook flared again this week, causing a dramatic hubbub in the tech industry. I\u2019d argue it was a nothing burger. Not because it was unimportant, but because it\u2019s clear that despite persistent evidence that our privacy is being violated, it might not matter.\nBasically, the two digital giants engaged in an esoteric tussle over how Facebook did an end run around Apple\u2019s very strict rules about data use on its app platform in order to suck up more user data. Through an app intended for internal use, Facebook paid people \u2014 including teenagers \u2014 $20 a month to track everything they did online. Since Facebook had been warned about this kind of thing before, Apple \u2014 noting the move was in \u201cclear breach of their agreement\u201d \u2014 retaliated by cutting off the oxygen, and Facebook\u2019s access to its own internal apps. It did not,as many suggested it should, shut off other popular consumer-facing offerings on the iPhone like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\nShall I explain more? No, I shall not, because the details hardly matter, except to note that what Facebook did is the equivalent of sneaking out of the house after the curfew your parents imposed after you last sneaked out of the house. To put it more plainly, it was obnoxious and squirrelly and just the kind of behavior that we all now assume the company is capable of. Which is to say, we don\u2019t trust Facebook in any way when it comes to using and protecting the data we entrust to it.\n[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this columnon Twitter.]\nAnd neither does Apple and its chief executive, Tim Cook. Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder and chief executive, is clearly getting on Mr. Cook\u2019s last nerve. I feel a little responsible for the acrimony, since it was inan MSNBC interview I did with Mr. Cookin March that the older, more seasoned executive decided to go full-bore on the young, leadership-challenged one.\nAt the time, Facebook was in the news for the rampant abuse of its platform by Russia, so I asked Mr. Cook about data abuse. He started by comparing Apple\u2019s business model to one like Facebook\u2019s: \u201cThe truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product. We\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d\nThen I asked: What would he do to fix it if he were Mr. Zuckerberg? His devastating answer: \u201cWhat would I do? I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d\nOuch. In Silicon Valley terms that response was akin to Cardi B beefing on Nicki Minaj, except quantumly more geeky. There was a sharp intake of breath from everyone in tech, and a very pissy response from Mr. Zuckerberg, in which he called Mr. Cook \u201cextremely glib.\u201d\nHe then asked his employees to use Google\u2019s Android phones instead of iPhones \u201cbecause it is the most popular operating system in the world.\u201d\nUh huh. Except that seems not to have worked and clearly many of his employees ignored the directive. There were reports that iPhone users at Facebook were left stranded this week when Apple cut off the company\u2019s ability to use other beta and internal apps on the iOS platform. Along with unreleased versions of apps, that also meant employees could not access things like bus schedules and cafeteria lunch menus. Apple has since reinstated use of those internal apps.\nNot knowing which fresh kombucha was being served at 1 Hacker Way obviously hit Facebook techies where they lived, which was the point.\nIt\u2019s interesting to compare Apple\u2019s response this time to a comparable episode with Google. TechCrunch (which brokethe original storyon the rogue Facebook app) noted that Google had done a similar thing with a research app. Apple did cut off its internal apps, but there was no public hand-slapping, and the tone between the companies has been cordial.\nThe difference: Mr. Cook has been irritated with Mr. Zuckerberg for a while, as tech companies like Apple have been lumped into the messes that Facebook has created, problems that have attracted the ire of regulators and the media.\nIt is not just Mr. Cook. A top executive at another tech giant termed it the \u201cFacebook contagion,\u201d and added, \u201cthey are infecting all of tech with their sloppy mistakes.\u201d\nBut what\u2019s most remarkable is how much Mr. Cook has become the critic-in-chief for Facebook.\nIt gets harder to play that role, however, when Apple makes mistakes, too. This week we learned that itsFaceTime service had a significant bugthat allowed people to spy on other people\u2019s phones. Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota both criticized Apple for being slow to reveal the issue to the public.\nIt was too slow. But in the end Apple was properly apologetic and did shut down the glitch. Still, it\u2019s not a good look to have a major privacy snafu right after touting your commitment to privacy.\nAnd it comes at a dicey time for Apple, which recently warned it was seeing weaker financial results and is under pressure to introduce even more new and innovative products. There is no rest for Mr. Cook, and many observers,including me, have posited that the next years for Apple will be challenging.\nStill, it\u2019s interesting that Mr. Cook climbed out on this limb anyway. Some insiders at Facebook are alleging he did so to get the heat off Apple\u2019s troubles. But that\u2019s a canard. Mr. Cook has long been vocal about distinguishing Apple from Facebook when it comes to user data and the importance of protecting privacy.\nThe bigger problem is that such an important issue might turn out to be the real nothing burger. Facebook turned in another stellar quarter this week, which made its stock rise strongly. So despite all the sketchy things the company is accused of doing by Apple and many others, most investors and analysts don\u2019t seem to care, and they will never care, as long as its digital advertising business \u2014 goosed by its astonishing and nakedly ambitious ability to suck in data, data and more data from all of us \u2014 continues to impress. Simply put, Wall Street does not care.\nOr to use an old bromide: Facebook is so poor, all it has is money.\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram, and sign up for theOpinion Today newsletter."

You can have a nachos-and-beer hangover on Monday and still be on top of the news.\nJan. 27-FEB. 2\nWhich would be more fearsome in a dark alley: Apple or Facebook? We may soon find out as the companies face off over privacy standards. Both announced their fourth-quarter earnings last week, and as expected, Apple\u2019s numberswere a flop(to blame: China\u2019s economic lethargy and a dwindling consumer demand for iPhones). Facebook, on the other hand \u2014 or thumb? \u2014 reportedrecord profits. It would seem that Facebook won this round \u2014 until Apple rained on its parade byshutting down an appthat Facebook was using to snoop around in users\u2019 online activity. Apple hasn\u2019t been shy about policing privacy issues before, but this move is downright aggressive, and a convenient distraction from its bad week.\nOne fear you can put to rest, if you have it:higher interest rates on your loans. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell,said last Wednesdaythat \u201cthe case for raising rates has weakened somewhat,\u201d signaling that rates may not go up this year after all. This was an about-face from the Fed\u2019s previous indications that it was planning to raise rates twice more in 2019. The markets were cheered by Mr. Powell\u2019s remarks, andAmerican stocks surgedto their best January levels in 30 years. But some investors were puzzled by the Fed\u2019s sudden change of heart, andothers worriedthat it revealed the risk of a recession on the horizon.\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuelaissued a threat to the United Stateslast Wednesday, saying if the Trump administration doesn\u2019t quit trying to oust him and install the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, its officials would get \u201ca Vietnam worse than they can imagine.\u201d He\u2019s widely viewed as an illegitimate dictator who drove his once-prosperous country into an economic catastrophe, but he\u2019s got some heft on his side. Russia, which has provided financial and military backing to Venezuela for years, is also none too pleased about the United States\u2019 oil sanctions against Mr. Maduro\u2019s government. Not by coincidence, the Russian state owns part of Venezuela\u2019s energy sector \u2014 a cash cow that it doesn\u2019t want to lose.\nfeb. 3-9\nNow that the government has (temporarily) reopened, Mr. Trump will deliver thepostponed State of the Union addresson Tuesday. He has said he will emphasize \u201cunity,\u201d and he will surely point to the country\u2019s economic growth and low unemployment numbers. (January\u2019s jobs report wasbetter than expected, even with the shutdown.) He may also reiterate his demand for a border wall, which he said last Thursday he would buildregardless of whether he gets congressional supportbefore the Feb. 15 deadline for a new spending bill. If he decides to bypass Congress, the government could close again \u2014 which no one wants. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that last month\u2019s shutdown would cost the country\u2019s economy an estimated$3 billion in reduced outputin 2019.\nChina and the United States madesome progressin trade talks last week, but China still isn\u2019t willing to make all the concessions that United States officials have demanded. So what will it take to settle this trade war before the 90-day truce ends on March 2? Mr. Trump says he wants China to buy more American goods (on top of Beijing\u2019s recent pledge to purchase five million tons of soybeans) and open its markets to American businesses more than it has ever done. He is planning to meet with President Xi Jinping of China sometime in February, ostensibly to sign a deal in person, but details are still forthcoming (as is the deal itself).\nAnd around we go again. British lawmakersvoted on Tuesdayto send the beleaguered Prime Minister Theresa May back to European Union leaders to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc. The problem is, those European Union leaders are done talking, as they\u2019ve said before and will say again. That gives Mrs. May little time (and even fewer options) to come up with a new plan before the next scheduled vote in Parliament on Feb. 14, followed by the actual Brexit deadline on March 29. As a no-deal scenario appears more likely, more British companies are hoarding products and moving operations elsewhere toprotect themselvesfrom a potential economic meltdown.\nThe record-low temperatures that grippedthe country last weekcould cost the economyup to $5 billionin business closings, property damage, flight cancellations, power cuts and evenbeer deliveries. The entire nation of Tonga had to gowithout internet access for 11 daysafter an essential underwater cable was severed. And more companies arecovering infertility treatments and egg-freezingcosts as part of their employee health care benefits: 44 percent of big employers (those with at least 20,000 workers) offered some sort of in vitro fertilization benefit in 2018, compared with only 37 percent in 2017."

And so the day went, the two tech titans going back and forth, until trading ended with Microsoft the leader at a market value of $823 billion.\nThe positions of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker\u2019s stock price late last year. The mantle has changed hands seven times among the three companies. Three of those switches have taken place over the past week as the big tech companies reported quarterly results. And Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) has lurked not far behind the whole time.\nThe competition reflects the global economic concerns hanging over the markets as well as the changing technology landscape, and it\u2019s a shift from past years. Apple passed Exxon Mobil to become the most valuable company in the United States almost eight years ago, and after 2012 it held on, largely unchallenged, for six years.\nThe company\u2019s ascension was a precursor to Big Tech\u2019s takeover of the stock market. Investors scooped up shares of the largest tech companies, believing their sales growth was unassailable, and by the second half of 2016, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple were the five most valuable companies in the S&P 500.\nBut investors\u2019 faith in Big Tech began to weaken last year. Apple fell hard as signs of a mature mobile phone market, a softening global economy and a trade war between China and the United States raised doubts about the company\u2019s ability to sell more iPhones.\nNearly $450 billion was wiped off its market value \u2014 an amount greater than all but six companies in the S&P 500.\nShares of the other tech titans fell as well. But Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet have fared far better than Apple and the broader market over the past year, as bets by the first two \u2014 and, to a lesser extent, by Alphabet \u2014 on cloud computing drove a surge in revenue.\nMicrosoft and Apple, which has recovered some of its losses since it reported earnings last week, are both valued at a little more than $820 billion.
