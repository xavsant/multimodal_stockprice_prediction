        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is working on a person-to-person payments service that may give iPhone owners another reason to use their Apple Wallets.\nThe company is in talks with banks about the new service, which would let people use their smartphones to send money to one another as easily as they send messages, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The service, which could be ready as soon as next year, would compete with PayPal\u2019s peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, and Square\u2019s Square Cash.\nApple started Apple Pay, a mobile payments service,in October 2014. This summer it combined payments with Passbook, an app that stored digital tickets and airline boarding passes, as the rebranded product Wallet.\nApple has said that it wants a bigger slice of the payments industry. Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said at the company\u2019sannual developer conferencein June that Apple\u2019s goal was \u201creplacing the wallet.\u201d\nIt remains a long way from that goal. As of October, less than 17 percent of iPhone 6 and 6s users were using Apple Pay, according todatafrom the research groupsPYMNTS.comand InfoScout.\n\u201cA peer-to-peer payments product could help Apple\u2019s Wallet gain traction,\u201d said Karen Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a consulting firm that studies platforms like mobile payments.\nApple\u2019s work on a peer-to-peer payments service wasreported earlierby The Wall Street Journal.\nPeer-to-peer payment services, which can foster consumer loyalty, are growing. This year, users of Facebook Messenger were offered apayment serviceakin to one that users of China\u2019s popular messaging app WeChat use to send payments to friends. Google has also experimented with payments in its messaging service.\nBanks are trying to create peer-to-peer payment products within their own mobile banking apps using abank-owned digital payments networkcalled clearXchange, which covers about 80 percent of all of the banks.\nAnd Square Cash has processed more than $1 billion in money transfers since the peer-to-peer program was introduced about two years ago, according to Square\u2019s recently filed prospectus for its initial public offering. Venmo, the money transfer app owned by PayPal and popular among younger users, processed nearly $2.4 billion in 2014.\nTo date, few of these efforts are direct moneymakers for the companies. Square Cash and Venmo are free to use when linked to a customer\u2019s checking account, and consumers are charged only a small fee when using a credit card.\nFor companies like Apple and Facebook, peer-to-peer payments are a way to involve customers more deeply with their products and to encourage them to leave their wallets at home.\n\u201cIncorporating payments into a circle of friends or a social interaction like messaging makes it seem more natural to use a mobile device to send people money,\u201d Ms. Webster said."

        "fulltext": "THE ECONOMIC COST OF TERRORISM|After the horrific attacks in Paris, it is an issue thatpolicy makers are grappling with,Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.\nResearch shows thatgross domestic product barely budgedafter the Madrid train bombings in 2004 and the bombs in London the year after. Consumption in the United States was stable after the Sept.\n                                                    11 attacks, but investment fell.\nStocks marketstypically recoverwithin weeks and on Monday, they were flat in Europe and up more than 1 percent in the United States.\nBut this reaction may belie thetrue cost of terrorism. Many regard the events in Paris as part of a continuum. The attacks could also have far-reaching implications for the future of the eurozone\n                                                    and companies there.\nThey could add to thepressure to close bordersand reignite a debate about privacy and surveillance that will have a big effect on technology companies. The indirect costs are difficult to measure.\nOne reminder that the scale of economic damage could be much higher is an academic study that showed thatIsrael\u2019s per capita G.D.P.would have been 8.6 percent higher in the period from 1994\n                                                    to 2003 had there been peace.\n\nSETBACKS CAST HARSH LIGHT ON MANHATTAN PROSECUTOR|The spotlight on the district attorney of Manhattan has been more intense since\n                                                    he sufferedseveral setbacks in white-collar trials,Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook.\nLawyers have been wondering whether the district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., made financial trials too complex and whether he has been aggressively pursuing matters that might have beenbetter off treated as civil disputes.\nMr. Vance conceded that the trial of three former executives of the once-mighty law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf could have been handled better. The men were accused of orchestrating an accounting fraud and\n                                                    he said that if there was a new trial for them, it would have to be \u201csimpler and shorter.\u201d\nThe trial took four months and the jury spent 21 days grappling with the 151 charges against the men.The deadlock now means that Mr. Vance has to decidewhether the men should be retried and how\n                                                    to streamline any new proceedings.\nHe is expected to decide by Dec. 7, when the parties are scheduled to return to court.\nIn another setback for Mr. Vance, in June, ajury acquitted two senior officersof Abacus Federal Savings Bank in a mortgage fraud case. Mr. Vance charged the Chinatown bank, and more than a dozen\n                                                    employees, with participating in a \u201csystematic\u201d scheme to sell fraudulent mortgages to Fannie Mae.\nQuestions have emerged over the trial readiness of his prosecutors after prosecutors working for Mr. Vance said the trial had been compromised by \u201cunanticipated witness issues and evidentiary issues.\u201d\nThe admission is oflittle comfort for some of the defendantswho have spent more than five years dealing with the investigation.\n\u201cIf you care more about the press conference than the proof, you end up charging people and institutions that you shouldn\u2019t andoverreaching in terms of theories,\u201d said Kevin\n                                                    R. Puvalowski, the main lawyer for Abacus. \u201cMy clients spent millions of dollars on this investigation and trial, and it seriously damaged their business for years.\u201d\nMr. Vance declined to elaborate on the court filing but said his office hadsecured guilty pleasfrom eight employees of the bank, which was evidence that crimes were committed.\n\u201cWe have not shied away from tough or challenging cases,\u201d Mr. Vance said. \u201cWe are going to do tough cases, and some of those cases the jury is not going to agree with us. That is thereality of prosecution.\u201d\n\nA ROCKY QUARTER FOR HEDGE FUNDS|Thousands of hedge funds have disclosed which stocks they bought in regulatory disclosures to\n                                                    the Securities and Exchange Commission for the third quarter andmany of them lost moneyfor their clients,\nAlexandra Stevenson and Matthew Goldstein report in DealBook.\nGrantham Mayo Van Otterloo, the large hedge fund that Jeremy Grantham helped found, increased itsstake in Valeantjust as it came under siege.

The deal would create the world\u2019s largest hotel company, with more than 5,500 owned or\n                                                    franchised hotels. The agreement represented a premium of about 6 percent above the average of where Starwood\u2019s stock had traded in the 20 days before Nov. 13.\nThepremium was lower than expected, given the competitive sales process, and Starwood\u2019s shares fell, while Marriott\u2019s gained.\nMarriott\u2019s chief executive, Arne M. Sorenson, said the deal promoted growth and value creation, but it wasnot evident from the figures,Jeffrey Goldfarb writes in Breakingviews.The deal looks decidedly defensive.\nShares in Starwood and its rivals have slipped steadily, despite regular consolidation.\nMarriott is paying apremium under 20 percent, worth about $1.9 billion, based on its stock price before media reports of potential buyers in October.\nIt anticipates about$200 million in annual cost savings. Once taxed and capitalized, these could be worth some $1.3 billion today.\nMarriott is paying more in premium than is justified by its stated savings, and Starwood investors have a fairly stingy premium to fall back on, Mr. Goldfarb writes. Theremay well be pushbackfrom\n                                                    hedge funds invested in Starwood.\n\n|Contactamie.tsang@nytimes.com\n\nLiberty Global to Buy Cable & Wireless for $5.5 Billion|The deal will expand the presence of the company controlled by John\n                                                    C.

        "title": "Volkswagen Hires Expert in Self-Driving Cars From Apple",
        "fulltext": "Volkswagenhas hired an expert in self-driving car technology fromApple, sending a signal that it will continue to invest in leading-edge technologies despite the financial burden created by its emissions cheating crisis.\nSeparately, the company has reached an agreement to largely complete its release of records sought by 47 American state attorneys general by year\u2019s end, people with knowledge of the investigations said. Investigators are examining violations of state law on two fronts for Volkswagen, which in September admitted to installing so-called defeat device software in 11 million diesel cars worldwide that was designed to detect when cars were in laboratory tests and cause the vehicles to lower their emissions of pollutants.\nWhile defeat devices are banned in the United States and Europe, the company said this week that it was still determining \u201cwhether the software in question officially constituted a defeat device\u201d under European Union regulations.\nGermany\u2019s motor vehicle regulatory agency said on Tuesday that it had ordered Volkswagen to retest 800,000 vehicles in Europe after the company admitted to making false claims about carbon dioxide emissions and fuel economy.\nBy hiring the former Apple executive Johann Jungwirth, 42, Volkswagen is signaling that the emissions crisis will not prevent the company from trying to keep pace with new developments in the industry. Mr. Jungwirth will lead a newly created Digitalization Strategy Department and report directly to Matthias M\u00fcller, the Volkswagen chief executive, the company said.\nAt Apple, Mr. Jungwirth, a former executive at the German carmaker Daimler, was formally director of Mac systems engineering. But he is widely believed to have been a member of a team working on a secretive car project for Apple.\nThe Apple car project has provoked nervousness among traditional automakers mindful of how the company upended the mobile phone market after it introduced the iPhone. Google has also been researching self-driving cars.\nVolkswagen is under severe financial pressure after admitting that it deceived regulators and customers for years about how much harmful emissions its vehicles produced. In addition to lost sales, Volkswagen faces billions of euros in costs to make vehicles compliant with regulations and to pay fines and legal judgments.\nMr. Jungwirth, who was born in Romania, holds an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Cooperative State University in Stuttgart, Germany, Volkswagen said. He also studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBefore joining Apple last year, Mr. Jungwirth was head of a research and development center in Sunnyvale, Calif., operated by Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler. The center\u2019s projects included research on self-driving vehicles and battery-powered cars.\nLast week, Volkswagen admitted to understating emissions of carbon dioxide, a cause of global warming, and overstating fuel economy for 800,000 vehicles in Europe. The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt, which regulates motor vehicles in Germany, said on Tuesday that it would supervise retesting of the vehicles and also investigate the process that led to the false emissions claims.\nThe erroneous carbon dioxide claims came to light after Volkswagen\u2019s September admission that it had installed defeat devices designed to deceive regulators about nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines.\nThe emissions-cheating investigations by 47 American states and the District of Columbia are being led by the attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington. The lead states issued a joint statement Monday evening after Volkswagen announced a plan to make payments of up to $1,000 to diesel owners in the United States, calling it \u201ca good-will gesture and nothing more.\u201d\n\u201cIt in no way diminishes the seriousness of the deceptive practices and environmental harms that are the subject of the states\u2019 investigation, or the determination of the attorneys general of 48 jurisdictions to hold Volkswagen to account for its conduct,\u201d the statement said.\nJeannine Ginivan, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen, said Tuesday, \u201cWe are cooperating with all agencies, but are unable to comment on active or pending litigation.\u201d\nThe attorney general\u2019s office in California, which has stringent environmental laws, is conducting its own investigation, as are attorneys general in Texas and West Virginia.\nThe Volkswagen case has little precedent, particularly because the company has already admitted wrongdoing. It is facing state civil investigations across the country, a criminal investigation by the Justice Department, a flurry of civil lawsuits and investigations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board.\nVW is also facing other investigations across the world, from the state prosecutor\u2019s office in Germany to regulators in South Korea. Last month, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office raided Volkswagen\u2019s French offices and seized computers. Regulators in India recently said that several of the company\u2019s models did not meet its emissions standards.\nJones Day, an American law firm, is also conducting an internal investigation on Volkswagen\u2019s behalf."

        "title": "Facebook\u2019s Notify App Funnels Custom Updates Onto Phone Screens",
        "fulltext": "In this age of data overload, information providers and social networks are competing to provide just the highlights that you want, when you want them. News outlets send alerts with breaking news and editors\u2019\n                                        picks of top stories. Twitter curates top tweets, organized by subject, intocollections it calls Moments.\n                                        Weather apps warn you of rain minutes before the droplets arrive.\nNow Facebook, whose popular social network uses an inscrutable algorithm to predict which posts from friends and organizations you most want to see, is trying to corral the highlights and bulletins you receive from\n                                        other services into one place. On Wednesday, itintroduced a new iPhone app called Notifythat it says will deliver \u201ctimely notifications about the things that\n                                        matter to you, from the sources you love, all in one place.\u201d\nTheNotify appis separate from the main Facebook service, although users must have a Facebook account to log in. Notify\u2019s primary purpose is to let you\n                                        sort through and choose to receive mobile-device notifications from various news and information sources on specific topics. If you want final scores or live updates from a San Francisco 49ers games, for example,\n                                        Fox Sports lets you sign up for those. Dying to know what the cover stories are in the latest issue of Vogue? Those, too, are available as alerts. There is even a daily meditation exercise from Headspace.\nThe notifications are delivered to your iPhone just like any other notification, meaning they show up on some of the most valuable real estate on today\u2019s smartphones: the lock screen that appears when a phone\n                                        has been idle for a while. The app also shows users all of their recent and saved notifications.\n\u201cThis is a central place you can go where you can build a notification experience that works for you,\u201d Julian Gutman, the Notify product manager, said in an interview.\nThere are about 70 content partners participating, including big broadcasters, like ABC and Fox News; lifestyle publications like Bon App\u00e9tit and Thrillist; business news outlets like Bloomberg and MarketWatch;\n                                        The Weather Channel; and the daily deals site Groupon. The New York Times is also a partner. In some cases, you can customize the alerts by your location, for things like weather or local news.\nFacebook envisions adding partners, including commercial partners like retailers, as it works out the kinks in the service, which initially will be available only in the United States. Currently, advertisements cannot\n                                        be sent as notifications, although it is easy to imagine how Facebook could eventually slip in some commercials, as it does with its Instagram photo-sharing service or the news feed in its core social network.\nFacebook\u2019s other recent initiative to court content creators, calledInstant Articles,\n                                        hosts articles on its social network to speed them up. Notify is more traditional \u2014 the partner organizations write the notification text and add a link to a mobile website of their choosing.\nThe idea of pushing information to Internet users, instead of asking them to pull up information through a browser or an app, has been aroundsince the early days of the Internet.\n                                        PointCast, for example, offered a push information service that was popular in 1996 and 1997, back when most Internet users were on dial-up connections. Many modern apps use push notifications heavily, including\n                                        the recommendation service Foursquare and Facebook itself.\nMore recently, the introduction of the Apple Watch spurred anew round of interest in notifications as a canvas unto themselves,instead of as just a way to alert people to content in other apps. Niche apps like Yo and IFTTT use notifications at the core of their services. Apple and Google are also building more notifications into their smartphone\n                                        operating systems that seek to anticipate what each user will want next.\nFacebook says Notify is a way to experiment with the notification format and to provide a simple tool to help other companies deliver the right information at the right time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most intimate way for you and the information you\u2019re interested in to connect,\u201d said Michael Cerda, a director of product management at Facebook who works on new media products.\nA version of this article appears in print on 11/16/2015, on pageB4of theNewYorkedition with the\n                                                headline: Facebook Notify Centralizes Updates."

        "fulltext": "Q.Is it possible to back up just my iTunes audio library to an external drive that I can then detach and connect to another computer to play?\nA.As long as you have an external hard drive large enough to hold your iTunes collection, you can back it up there and use it with another computer. To make sure you get all the tracks in your library in one place for copying, have iTunesconsolidate all your filesinto its iTunes Media folder; if you have been using iTunes for several years, this may be called the iTunes Music folder instead.\nTofind your iTunes folderin the default location on a Mac, go to your Home folder and look inside the Music folder; on a computer running Windows 7 and later, go to your user folder then open My Music to see the iTunes folder. If you moved the folder elsewhere at some point and cannot remember where, open iTunes, go to the Preferences box (found under the iTunes menu on a Mac or under the Edit menu on the PC version) and click the Advanced tab to see the folder location listed.\nOnce you find the folder on the computer, quit the iTunes program and drag the iTunes folder to the external hard drive. Wait for all the files to copy over before you disconnect the drive.\nAfter you connect the external drive to the other computer, hold down the Option key on a Mac or the Shift key in Windows as you start the iTunes program. When theChoose iTunes Librarybox pops up, click the Choose Library button and navigate to the iTunes folder on the external drive. You should then see your music files displayed in the iTunes window.\nIf you plan to move the external drive between copies of iTunes running on a Windows-based computer and on a Mac, make sure the drive isset up in a format like exFATthat works with both systems. And if your iTunes library contains copyright-protected songs bought from the Apple iTunes Store, you will need toauthorize the other computerto play the files.\nRemoving Results From Google Search\nQ.How do I ask Google to stop showing pages with information and photos about me in search results?\nA.Googlerecommendsthat if you want a certain web page or photos taken down, you should first contact the webmaster or site owner to request that the items be removed from public view. Even if Google stopped linking to the material in question, other search engines could still display it in their results because the original source would still be found online.\nAs protection against identity theft, Google removes certain types of personal information from its search results upon request, including images that clearly show Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card digits, and photos of handwritten signatures.

Square was valued at $6 billion in its latest private valuation a year ago. Thevaluation discount was large enoughto make investors flock to the meeting.\nMr. Dorsey is expected toattend all the I.P.O. roadshow events, in which management meets with prospective investors across the country.\nThis is a debut of sorts for Mr. Dorsey who, despite being a founder of Twitter, was a chairman andnot a major participant in investor meetingswhen that company went public.\nAt a group lunch, the venue was packed, with one determined investor walking up 11 flights of stairs because the elevator wait was too long.Investors who attended the meeting on Wednesday said they\n                                                    werelargely impressed by Mr. Dorsey\u2019s preparedness and charisma.\nThe low price and scarcity of tech public offeringscould help shares popwhen Square starts trading.\nSquare\u2019s management plans to visit other cities, including Chicago and Boston, and then head back west to San Francisco on Monday.

Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said in June that its goal was to replace\n                                                    the wallet.\nIt has some way to go.Less than 17 percent of iPhone 6 or 6s userswere using Apple Pay in October. It also faces competition from companies like Facebook and banks.\nFew of the comparable services are moneymakers. Square Cash and Venmo are free to use when linked to a checking account.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Janet L.

Bernanke pushed for and put into place\n                                                    while serving as Fed chairman will lead inevitably to anear-term financial crisis,William D. Cohan writes in the Street Scene column.Mr. Bernanke\n                                                    says that idea is beyond ridiculous.\nMr. Cohan argues that quantitative easing and keeping short-term interest rates near zero has created the equivalent of\u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d, with investors being forced to hunt rapaciously\n                                                    for riskier, higher-yielding investments because safer options offer only a pittance.\nAs a result, risk has been mispriced and created a bubble. Mr. Cohan thinks the increasing prices for financial assets are unsustainable and willlead to the next financial crisis.\nMr. Bernanke argued in a conversation with Mr. Cohan that his policiesprevented a bad situation from becoming worse. He also countered that rates had not been held down for too long. \u201cWe said\n                                                    we would not raise rates at least \u2013 very clearly, many times \u2013 at least until unemployment got to 6.5 percent. We never said we would when it got to 6.5 percent. We never said that.\u201d\nHe said that the claim that easing or the zero-interest-rate policy made the rich richer and hurt savers wasa \u201cred herring.\u201dHe conceded that there was too much inequality in the United\n                                                    States but said that long-term trends like globalization were to blame, not the Fed.\nHe also said the blame for theextended period of low interest ratesbelonged with Congress, not with the Fed.\n\u201cGo complain to Congressbecause the fiscal policy turned very contractionary, which meant the Fed had to bear the entire burden of creating a recovery,\u201d he said. \u201cIf fiscal policy\n                                                    had been more balanced, then we could\u2019ve had the same recovery with higher interest rates.\u201d\nMr. Bernanke maintained that he was not worried about an asset-price bubble. What he does worry about is thatwhen the Fed raises interest rates, the economic recovery in the United States could \u201cfalter.\u201d\n\u201cThe concerns I would have are not about asset bubbles or inequality,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concerns I would have is,what\u2019s the right moment to raise ratesfrom the point of\n                                                    view of sustaining the economic recovery? That\u2019s the tough call that Janet and her team there are trying to make.

        "title": "With a Mobile Website Like an App, Flipkart Takes a Swipe at Apple",
        "fulltext": "India\u2019s e-commerce start-up Flipkart has worked with Google to make a new mobile website that could eliminate the need for apps, in a move that takes a swipe at Apple\u2019s grip on the mobile experience.\nOn Monday, Flipkart unveiled the website, which it created with the Google team that focuses on the mobile web browser Chrome. The two made a site that supports push notifications, the ability to search for and read\n                                        information while offline, location-based data and access to hardware features like a smartphone\u2019s camera. While such features have long been available in apps that people download to their phones, they typically\n                                        have not been prevalent on mobile websites.\nFlipkart plans to show other companies what it took to build the website \u2014 including the hurdles it had to overcome and the weaknesses it found \u2014 at Google\u2019s Chrome Developers Conference this month.\n                                        Google\u2019s parent company is Alphabet.\n\u201cWhen users go to mobile websites, they\u2019re often asked to download an app because the experience and functionality is better,\u201d said\u00a0Peeyush Ranjan, Flipkart\u2019s head of engineering. But\n                                        apps have their downsides, and it can be harder to get people to download them than it is to get people to visit a website, he said. What\u2019s more, websites can easily be updated to fix security problems or\n                                        other glitches, but users might not update their apps, he said.\nSo \u201cwe approached Chrome and asked if the team there could make these app capabilities or improve features they had already created,\u201d said Mr. Ranjan, a former engineer at Google.\nIn collaborating with Flipkart, Google is hoping the new mobile site will spawn many imitators. The search giant has long battled with Apple over who will deliver information to mobile device users, a fight that has\n                                        leftsome companies caught in the middle.\nApple wants to encourage consumers to get their information and services from apps, which people can download from its App Store and which have helped make the company\u2019s iPhone a must-have device. Google wants\n                                        people to use the open web, since that lets the company show web search ads to as many people as possible.\n\u201cUltimately, we want this to have an impact on how people use the mobile web,\u201d said Rahul Roy-Chowdhury, director of product management at Chrome. He said this is especially true in emerging markets like\n                                        India, where smartphone adoption is booming but connectivity is sporadic or slow and it is hard to store apps because of slow download times.\nChrome has been releasing new features and tools to make using the mobile web easier. Late last year, Chrome introducedservice workers,\n                                        which let websites support offline experiences. In April, Chromeannouncedsupport for mobile web push notifications. Facebook,\n                                        Vice News and Pinterest have since integrated the feature.\nFlipkart is perhaps the first large consumer company to use all of the new pieces of Chrome to make a website that comes close to replicating an app.\nOther companies are also trying to build mobile websites that behave like apps. A San Francisco company called Wrap Media, for example, builds mobile websites that look and feel like apps and that can be viewed inside\n                                        social networks, messaging apps or on the web.\nEric Greenberg, founder of Wrap, said he is helping companies that want to create the best experience for users without being dependent on the app ecosystem.\n\u201cAs long as the web isn\u2019t really usable on a mobile phone, Apple wins,\u201d Mr. Greenberg said."

        "fulltext": "The new Apple TVhas been out for only about two weeks, but there are already hundreds of apps available for downloading to the set-top box. The apps have the potential to make your television truly \u201csmart,\u201d so it\u2019s time to experiment with the best gaming, shopping, video and utility apps and see how they transform the set in your living room.\nOne of my favorite iPhone games,Alto\u2019s Adventure, is a great example of how big gaming will be on Apple TV. The Apple TV version of the game puts you in control of a number of characters, each tasked with snowboarding down a mountain, herding runaway llamas, picking up coins and leaping over difficult obstacles. The mountain never ends and its features never repeat, so each time you play, you get a slightly different experience.\nThe controls are simple: You press a button on the Apple TV remote control to jump and you hold it down to back flip. The game presents challenges on each level, like completing two back flips in one run.\nThe graphics in Alto\u2019s Adventure are beautiful and simple, and if you play in the dark, the sound effects and lightning flashes racing across your TV are atmospheric. Alto\u2019s Adventure costs $3 for Apple TV, but it\u2019s free if you have alreadybought it for your iPhone.\nThe Apple TV is also capable of console-quality games. A case in point isAsphalt 8: Airborne, a classic car game in which you race rivals around tracks or through city streets.\nAsphalt\u2019s Apple TV app is no simplified version of a racing game. There are the usual features like multiple tracks, championships and different cars with modifications (and with so many options to choose from, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the many menus before you actually get to racing the cars.) When you\u2019re turning the Apple TV remote control in the air to steer your speeding vehicle, the action is genuinely fast and furious.\nAsphalt 8 is satisfying to play, with enough special tricks like jumps to keep it interesting. The game, which is free to download, offers a hint of the more complex games yet to come to Apple TV.\nFor a more family-friendly gaming experience, try theSing! Karaokeapp for Apple TV. This free app ispopular on the iPhonebut works better on a television. The app highlights the lyrics to a popular song on the screen as an instrumental version plays in the background. You can sing by yourself, perform a duet with a partner elsewhere in the world or sing with friends in the same room if they use the Sing! Karaoke mobile app, which will transform their phones into microphones.\nIt\u2019s silly, simple, rewarding fun \u2014 so much so that I got distracted singing pop songs while writing this column. The app is free, as is the catalog of tens of thousands of songs.\nGilt, the shopping site, has a free Apple TV app that hints at the future of the smart TV user experience. The app essentially creates an on-screen catalog for discounted clothes, accessories and household items offered by the digital store. The app is easy to navigate, with photos filling the screen to showcase products. With a few swipes and clicks of the remote, it\u2019s easy to find things you may be interested in buying. If you have already signed up for a Gilt account online, you can buy what you see on the screen directly through the app.\nAirbnb, the room rental website, also has a free app that has made a smooth transition to the Apple TV. The promotional images for each property in the company\u2019s catalog look especially good on a big screen. But there is a catch: You can\u2019t book a vacation property through the app. You can find rentals you like and bookmark them on the Apple TV app, but you must complete the booking on your phone, tablet or computer.\nCarrot Weatheris anotherpopular iPhone appthat is now available for Apple TV. The weather app, which costs $4, comes with cartoonish graphics, eerie voice-overs and sarcastic forecasts. It\u2019s a fun alternative to Apple TV\u2019s built-in weather app.\nLastly, theNetflix,TEDandCourseraapps are fabulous examples of how Apple TV offers a different experience from traditional TV channels, with more specific content.\nThe TED app, which lets you watch talks from the well-known TED gatherings on a TV, has high production values and is a good way to see the presentations on a bigger screen. Coursera, an online education company, also has an Apple TV app that shows instructional videos on subjects such as deep physics.\nNetflix, the online streaming company, is changing how the world thinks about on-demand movies and TV series, and its graphics-heavy interface works well on the Apple TV and with the gestural controls of the Apple TV remote control.\nGoogle Keepis an excellent Evernote-like scrapbooking app for Android phones that is useful for keeping track of your musings while you are on the go. Now Keep has arrived on iOS. An alternative to Apple\u2019s own note-taking app, it offers extras like the option to set time- or location-based reminders in your notes.It\u2019s free."

        "fulltext": "Q.Is there a way to back up the contact files that I sync between my computers and iCloud?\nA.You canexport a copy of your contacts from Apple\u2019s iCloud as a vCard fileand then store that file in a safe place in case of a server-related emergency. Just select some or all of the contacts you want to back up, then click the cog-shaped Action menu icon in the bottom-left corner of the browser window to get to the Export vCard option.\nLater, if disaster strikes and your address book gets wiped from the web, you can use the Import vCard option on that same iCloud Action menu topull in the backup copyof your contacts file. You can alsoarchive your iCloud contactsfrom your computer by using theContacts app on Mac OS XorMicrosoft Outlook for Windows.\nIf you are having trouble keeping youriCloud contactsin sync, Apple has ahelp pagefor dealing with several related issues, as well asinstructions for backing up data from other iCloud-synced appslike Calendars, Mail and others. Server issues may sometimes be the problem if you cannot get to your files, so you may also want to bookmark theSystem Status pagefor iCloud Contacts (and all Apple\u2019s other online services) to make sure it is them \u2014 and not you \u2014 having a problem.\nSaying Howdy to Windows Hello\nQ.Does Windows Hello send your biometric data to Microsoft?\nA.Windows Hello, the newsecurity featureinWindows 10that lets you log into the machine with your face, iris or fingerprint, keeps your personal biometric data on your laptop or tablet. The information is not sent to Microsoft or third-party companies, according to theWindows Hello privacy questions page.\nHowever, Microsoft says it does collect information on how you use Windows Hello, like the number of times you tried to sign in using the software and how many times you successfully logged into your device by using a body part instead of a password. The company says this information is stripped of anything that can personally identify you and is encrypted before it is uploaded to Microsoft servers.\nWhen you go through the Windows Hello setup, the software does not actually take pictures of your face, eye or finger that could be vulnerable to misuse if your computer is compromised. Microsoft\u2019sFrequently Asked Questions page describesthe data as \u201ca representation based on the unique qualities of your face, fingerprint, or iris\u201d that is more like a graph than an image and cannot be used to reconstitute an image of your physical features.\nTouse Windows Hello in the first place, your computer or tablet needs to have a fingerprint reader that is compatible with theWindows Biometric Frameworksoftware, or an illuminated infrared camera for facial recognition and iris detection. Microsoft\u2019s newSurface Book and Surface Pro 4 devicesare among those that work with Windows Hello, as do some other devices that come withIntel\u2019s RealSense camera."
