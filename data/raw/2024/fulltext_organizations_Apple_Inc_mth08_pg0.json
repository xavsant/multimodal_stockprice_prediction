        "title": "After Google Antitrust Ruling, Here\u2019s Where Other Big Tech Cases Stand",
        "fulltext": "The U.S. government\u2019s landmark antitrust trial against Google\u2019s search business concluded on Monday with a federal judge\u2019s ruling that thecompany acted illegallyto maintain a monopoly. But the parade of major federal cases challenging the power of the tech giants is just getting going.\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission started investigating Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and WhatsApp, for monopolistic behavior. The government has since sued all four companies \u2014 Google twice \u2014 in what it says is an effort to rein in their power and promote more competition. The companies have denied the claims.\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s next with the U.S. government v. Big Tech.\nIn September, theF.T.C. and 17 states sued Amazon, accusing it of protecting a monopoly by squeezing sellers on its vast marketplace and favoring its own services. The practices also harmed consumers, the F.T.C. argued, and resulted in some cases of \u201cartificially higher prices\u201d because Amazon prevented those selling goods on its site from offering the same products on other online sites for less.\nA judge in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington set the trial for October 2026.\nAmazon has asked the judge to dismiss the case and has argued that it often offers low prices to consumers and doesn\u2019t hurt sellers on its marketplace. The lawsuit shows a \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of retail,\u201d the company has argued.\nThe chair of the F.T.C., Lina Khan, who isfamous in certain circlesfor a 2017 Yale Law Journal antitrust paper on how to rein in Amazon, has vowed to take on tech monopolies.\nAmazon has described the lawsuit as \u201cmisguided\u201d and warned that if the F.T.C. prevailed, it would \u201cforce Amazon to engage in practices that actuallyharmconsumers and the many businesses that sell in our store.\u201d\nTheDepartment of Justice sued Applein March, accusing the company of using a monopoly in the smartphone market to block competition, inflate prices for consumers and stifle competition. The department joined 15 states and the District of Columbia in its lawsuit after a nearly two-year investigation.\nIn the suit, filed in U.S. District Court of New Jersey, the department said Apple blocked companies from offering applications that competed with Apple products like cloud-based streaming apps, messaging and the digital wallet.\nLast week, Apple filed a motion to dismiss the case and said its business decisions didn\u2019t violate antitrust laws. It has also argued that those decisions make the iPhone a better experience.\n\u201cThis lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,\u201d Apple previously said in a statement. \u201cWe believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it.\u201d\nIn addition to the search lawsuit, the Justice Department filed aseparate suit against Google in January 2023 over online advertising. That case is scheduled to go to trial in September.\nThe department and eight states sued in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, saying Google acquired rivals through anticompetitive mergers and bullied publishers and advertisers into using the company\u2019s ad technology.\nIn the search casethat the judge ruled upon on Monday, he will next order changes to the company\u2019s business to fix the illegal behavior.\nThe F.T.C. sued Meta in December 2020, accusing the company of creating a monopoly in social media by buying Instagram and WhatsApp. The mergers deprived consumers of alternative social media platforms, the F.T.C. argued.\nThe lawsuit has taken more twists and turns than the other Big Tech antitrust cases. It was filed in U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia before the company changed its name to Meta, from Facebook. In 2021, Judge James Boasberg dismissed the complaint, saying the F.T.C. didn\u2019t adequately define the market that it accused Meta of monopolizing. But he allowed the agency to refile its lawsuit, and it moved forward the next year.\nThe F.T.C. joined 40 states inaccusing Facebook of buyingboth Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago toillegally squash competitionthat could have one day challenged the company\u2019s dominance. The regulators have called for the deals to be unwound.\nMeta has argued that it didn\u2019t acquire Instagram and WhatsApp to kill competition and that it has invested heavily in developing innovations for the apps.\nTripp Micklecontributed reporting from San Francisco."

        "title": "Sales of Macs and iPads Lead Apple\u2019s Quarterly Revenue Up 5%",
        "fulltext": "This spring, Apple updated its iPads and Macs with faster processors and new features. The improvements are already paying off.\nOn Thursday, the tech giant said sales of iPads and Macs jumped by more than 12 percent during the three months that ended in June, helping the company bounce back after a series of lackluster quarters.\nApple reported that sales rose 5 percent, to $85.78 billion, while profit increased 8 percent, to $21.45 billion. The results exceeded Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations for $20.65billion in profit during the quarter.\nThe company said it expected revenue to increase in the current quarter, which ends in September. Shares were flat in after-hours trading.\nDemand for iPads and Macs helped offset weak iPhone sales. Interest in iPhones has wanedin China, where competition from Huawei has intensified.\nIn China, sales of Huawei phones have surged over the past year. The Chinese smartphone maker increased its shipments in China by 45 percent during the June quarter, while Apple\u2019s shipments fell 5 percent.\nApple said iPhone sales fell 1 percent, to $39.3 billion in the quarter. Total sales in China fell 6.5 percent, to $14.73 billion.\nInvestors are optimistic that iPhone sales will rebound later this year after Apple releases new models with generative artificial intelligence features. In June, the company unveiled a suite of A.I. products that it is calling Apple Intelligence. The system will prioritize messages and offer writing tools to improve emails, notes and texts. It will be driven by an upgraded Siri, Apple\u2019s virtual assistant, and complemented by answers from ChatGPT, the chatbot from OpenAI.\nThe new features, which will become available this fall, helped calm concerns that Apple had fallen behind its biggest rivals in the tech industry\u2019s embrace of A.I. The company\u2019s stock has risen 11 percent since then, to $218.36, helping it reclaim its position as the world\u2019s most valuable tech company.\nWall Street analysts are predicting that the A.I. features will lift iPhone sales to a record in the final three months of the year. Millions of iPhone owners are sitting on older devices that are due for an upgrade. Several analysts have predicted that the company will sell more than 90 million units, the most in that period since it sold 88 million iPhones in late 2021.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the eve of the new iPhone 16 with A.I. features and everyone is excited,\u201d said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company, an investment firm in Georgia that counts Apple among its largest holdings. \u201cThat could create the first catalyst we\u2019ve seen for iPhone for a while.\u201d\nApple continues to benefit from its decision several years ago to broaden its focus beyond selling more devices to selling more software and services across its existing devices. The company said its services business, which includes the sales of apps, Apple Music and Apple Pay, increased sales 14percentto $24.21billion in the quarter.\nDuring a call with Wall Street analysts, Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, said the company expected the introduction of Apple Intelligence later this year to help bolster its services business. This week, the company rolled out the first version of those features to app developers. Mr. Cook said customers would receive the features under a staggered fashion, with ChatGPT becoming available by the end of the year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited to get the initial seed out there and see what do,\u201d he said of the app developers.\nBut that business\u2019s future growth has been challenged by antitrust authorities around the world. In the European Union, Britain and the United States, regulators have pressured Apple to open up its App Store.\nLast month, theEuropean Union charged Applewith imposing unfair restrictions on developers and violating a new law meant to encourage competition in the tech industry. Apple has defended its practices, but it could face a fine of up to 10 percent of its global revenue.\nIn the United States, a federal judge is expected to issue a decision that could upend the company\u2019s business arrangement with Google. TheJustice Department has accused Googleof illegally locking in its monopoly by making its search option the default on devices from Apple and other brands. If the judge prevents Google from paying Apple for that position in the future, it could cost Apple about $20 billion a year."

        "title": "Apple Store Workers Get First U.S. Contract",
        "fulltext": "Workers at the first unionized Apple Store in the country ratified a labor contract with the tech giant on Tuesday, after a year and a half in which bargaining appeared to stall for long stretches and union campaigns at other stores fell short.\nAfter the union announced the outcome, Apple said it did not dispute the result and was pleased to have an agreement.\nThe contract, covering about 85 workers at a Towson, Md., store whovoted to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in June 2022, will provide a typical worker with a raise of roughly 10 percent over the next three years.\nThe workers will also effectively receive the same benefits as those in nonunion stores \u2014 a point of contention since the companyintroduced new benefitsthat excluded union stores in the fall of 2022 \u2014 as well as guaranteed severance pay.\n\u201cWe are giving our members a voice in their futures and a strong first step toward further gains,\u201d the store\u2019s bargaining committee said in a statement after reaching a deal with the company. \u201cTogether, we can build on this success in store after store.\u201d\nThe contract talks had appeared to bog down over equal access to the benefits that other stores receive, and over a nationwide change in Apple\u2019s scheduling and availability policy for part-time workers. The union said the policy change would have forced roughly half a dozen Towson workers to quit because of conflicts with other commitments.\nWorkers at the store said they had considered striking if the company had not budged on these priorities; they voted in May to authorize a strike.\nBut the two sides settled both issues late last month. Union workers will receive the recently introduced benefits and any subsequent changes to existing benefits. They will bargain over any new benefit when it is introduced.\nThe company agreed to allow the half-dozen part-time workers imperiled by the new availability policy to remain largely under the old policy if they choose to. The union agreed to drop a handful of proposals, including a more generous overtime rule and bereavement leave.\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of our bargaining committee and our store team for sticking through this long journey,\u201d said Chaya Barrett, a committee member and a longtime worker at the store. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging, scary and frustrating road.\u201d\nAn Apple spokeswoman said the agreement \u201callows Towson team members to enjoy similar performance-based wage increases this year as last year, along with the same benefits our U.S. retail employees currently receive.\u201d\nThe contract will provide an average worker with a 4 percent wage increase this year, followed by 3 percent increases in two subsequent years. Apple typically reviews wages for nonunion workers annually. The company\u2019s policy is to provide severance pay to workers laid off for business reasons, but the union contract guarantees that the severance pay won\u2019t change.\nAfter the successful union election in Towson, workers at an Apple Store in Oklahoma Cityvoted to jointhe Communications Workers of America in October 2022. But campaigns atother Apple Storesfizzled outin the following months, and the communications workerslost a unionization votethis year at a store in Short Hills, N.J.\nThe Towson union argued that the contract proposal undermined a core claim that Apple, like many employers, hadmadetoworkersahead of union elections: that they could lose benefits if they unionized.\n\u201cThis took away their narrative,\u201d said Jay Wadleigh, a business agent with the machinists\u2019 union who advised the workers during the negotiation. \u201cThey tell stores: \u2018You could lose everything. You\u2019d have to start at ground zero.\u2019 We have a contract saying that\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\nExperts said that as a result, the contract could assist future organizing campaigns at other stores.\n\u201cI think it will help somewhat,\u201d said John Logan, a professor at San Francisco State University who is an expert on how companies respond to union campaigns. Fear of losing one\u2019s job or losing pay or benefits tends to be the biggest obstacle to union organizing, he added, so \u201canything that lessens the fear of joining a union is likely to benefit organizing at other stores.\u201d\nIn the short term, the Oklahoma City store, which has been bargaining separately with Apple since last year, is seeking to reach a contract along similar lines in the coming months.\nMichael Forsythe, a worker on the Oklahoma City bargaining committee, said the Towson contract had generated considerable interest among his colleagues. \u201cWe definitely want to use it as momentum,\u201d he said. Workers there plan a strike authorization vote this month.\nWorkers at other Apple Stores have begun to express interest in unionizing since the tentative agreement in Towson, according to Kevin Gallagher, a longtime employee there who recently began working for the machinists\u2019 union.\nMr. Gallagher said he had recently spoken with a worker at a store in the Southeast who had inquired about organizing after hearing news of the contract agreement."

        "title": "Apple Giving Ground on App Store Rules to Appease Regulators",
        "fulltext": "Governments around the world have pressured Apple with laws and lawsuits that aim to loosen its grip over the digital economy. Now, the tech giant is beginning to make concessions that could change people\u2019s iPhone experience.\nIn Europe, where anew law permits third-party app storesand app promotions, Apple has approved a competing app store from Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, and permitted the streaming app Spotify to list its summer pricing discount inside its music streaming app, Epic and Spotify said on Wednesday.\nIn the United States, where a Justice Department lawsuit accuses Apple of creating a smartphone monopoly, the company said on Wednesday that it would allow apps to use its contactless transaction technology, the NFC chip, to provide customers with in-store payments, hotel keys and rewards cards.\nThe changes are among the first examples of how Apple is opening up the iPhone. The company has spent much of the past year testing the boundaries of how far it must go to satisfy the demands of government authorities. It has introduced alternative fees, developed new processes for collecting commissions and added warnings for customers who download third-party app stores.\nApp developers say Apple\u2019s changes still show thatthe company is more interested in protecting its businessthan complying with the law. Governments have responded to that criticism by intensifying their scrutiny of Apple\u2019s business.\nIn June, the European Commissioncharged Apple with violating the 2022 Digital Markets Act, which gives regulators the authority to force tech giants to change their business practices. In May, Apple returned to federal court in California to defend its requirement that app developers pay it a 27 percent commission of sales through alternative payment systems, which developers say violates afederal judge\u2019s orderto offer other ways to pay for services.\n\u201cIt does appear to me that their strategy is to try to wear down regulators,\u201d said Tim Sweeney, the chief executive of Epic Games, which largely lost a 2020 lawsuit it filed against Apple for antitrust violations.\nApple has said it complies with the law in Europe and faces a competitive marketplace. It says its rules and fees are a fair trade for providing access to billions of iPhone customers. In the past, the company accused vocal critics like Epic and Spotify of benefiting from its software tools while not paying money in commissions for years.\n\u201cThe Digital Markets Act required us to enable new capabilities for developers in the European Union, and we have worked to make them as easy as possible for users while also trying to protect their privacy and security,\u201d an Apple spokesman said in a statement.\nEpic started planning its new app store in 2022. This year, Appleapproved, terminated and thenrestoredan account for Epic Games Sweden, the company\u2019s Swedish subsidiary, to gain access to the software tools necessary for the release.\nThe Epic Games Store is available for download on Friday. It features Epic\u2019s own games initially, including Fall Guys, Rocket League Sideswipe and Fortnite, but will be open to other game makers, which will pay Epic a 12 percent commission on sales.\nDuring a media briefing on Wednesday, Mr. Sweeney said Apple had created a \u201cscare screen\u201d that warns iPhone users in Europe who go to download the store that installing a third-party store isn\u2019t allowed by their operating system. It takes about 15 steps to complete the download, which he said was intentional.\n\u201cApple can make screens that are incredibly easy and intuitive and natural,\u201d Mr. Sweeney said. \u201cThe fact that they made this so horrible just shows malicious intent.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman said the download process wasn\u2019t cumbersome and added that the process takes fewer steps than Epic detailed in its media briefing.\nOn Wednesday, Spotify said it would begin displaying its summer promotional pricing for subscriptions in its app in Europe. It said it was able to do so after theEuropean Commission found that Apple had violated antitrust lawsand fined it nearly $2 billion for blocking music streaming services from showing promotions in their apps, among other things. But Spotify said Apple still prevented it from including a link to make purchases in the app without being charged a fee.\nApple has responded to criticism about linking out for purchases with new fees. It said this month that apps in Europe could provide links but would have to pay a 5 percent \u201cacquisition fee\u201d on a sale and a 20 percent \u201cstore fee.\u201d Combined, the fees would equal up to a 25 percent commission on sales for some developers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re determined not to lose a dime of revenue,\u201d said Gene Burrus, the global policy counsel for the Coalition for App Fairness, a Washington trade group with nearly 80 members, including Spotify and Match Group.\nOn Wednesday, Apple said it would make the technology behind its tap-and-go service available to app developers in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and Britain. It said developers would have to opt into a new set of terms and fees. An Apple spokesman declined to disclose the terms or fees."

        "fulltext": "When Google released its first Android smartphone in 2008, the company\u2019s founders slid onstage in roller skates. One of them, Larry Page, said the device wasas advanced as a computer had been a few years before.\nOn Tuesday, executives left the skates behind but kept to the tone of that pitch: Google crammed all the cutting-edge technology it could into the latest Pixel phones. The devices are chock-full of artificial intelligence, to let users engage with a conversational assistant, edit people into photos and search for information found in their screenshots, the company said in blog posts.\nGoogle is hoping the features will help the four new phones \u2014 including the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro and the double-wide Pixel 9 Fold \u2014 finally overcome consumer apathy to its smartphone ambitions. It is Google\u2019s latest attempt to make a splash in a smartphone market dominated by its partner Samsung, as well as by Apple, whichhas already detailed the A.I. capabilities coming to the next generation of iPhones.\nGoogle\u2019s effort to make itself a significant player in consumer hardware has been an uphill climb. It has about5 percent of the smartphone market in the United States, and generally less than that in other major markets, like Britain, Germany and India, according to Statista, which compiles data.\nThe company gets most of its revenue from advertising on its search engine and YouTube video platform. Last week,a federal judge ruled that Google had acted illegally to maintain a monopolyin online search, in a decision that could upend the company\u2019s lucrative business model. Google said it would appeal the decision and \u201cremain focused on making products that people find helpful.\u201d\nGoogle has tried to use the excitement around generative A.I. chatbots and features to reset the competition. In April, Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, announced that he was merging its teams that develop Android with those that engineer Pixel devices and other hardware. The hope was that combining the two would make it easier to incorporate more A.I. into the products and speed up decision-making.\nAll the phones are available for preorder on Tuesday. Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL will launch Aug. 22 and the other two on Sept. 4.\nGoogle suggested that its A.I. features would arrive sooner than Apple\u2019s, which said it would add A.I. to its smartphones by this fall. Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president who oversees hardware and Android, said he understood \u201cpeople\u2019s skepticism\u201d when it comes to the rollout of A.I.\n\u201cThere have been so many promises, so many \u2018coming soons\u2019 and not enough real-world helpfulness when it comes to A.I.,\u201d Mr. Osterloh said, \u201cwhich is why today, we\u2019re getting real. We have lots of live demos of products, features and A.I. experiences that are starting to ship with Android and our new Pixel devices.\u201d\nGoogle said that the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which has two screens \u2014 one outside and a wider screen when unfolded \u2014 would bring users \u201cthe best of Google\u2019s A.I.\u201d The device starts at $1,799, the company said, while the rest of the lineup starts from $799 to $1,099, depending on size and specifications.\nWhile Google\u2019s share of the smartphone market is small, it has recently made some strides. The company\u2019s 4.6 percent of the smartphone market in 2023 was up from 3.6 percent a year earlier,according to data from the research firm IDC.\nBesides the new phones, the company showcased the Pixel Watch 3 and Pixel Buds Pro 2, headphones that incorporated the company\u2019s Tensor A1 computer chips for the first time. Google said they were designed for its A.I. and advanced audio processing, so users could have clearer calls and hear less outside noise.\nThe company is hoping that its latest product blitz will be helped by its A.I. It has incorporated its Gemini chatbot, formerly named Bard, into the Android operating system used by billions of people.\nOne service, Gemini Live, will allow phone users to have audio conversations with the chatbot and ask complex questions or learn what kinds of jobs might be suited to their skill-set and degree, the company said. It is available to those who pay to subscribe to Gemini starting today. Google said it would give phone customers a free year of its premium A.I. plan, for access to more features.\nGemini will also connect with new apps in the coming weeks, including Calendar, Tasks and more features on YouTube Music, to make it a more helpful assistant.\nGoogle acknowledged that all these efforts would bring A.I. deeper into users\u2019 private lives, and said that it would safeguard their data by not sharing it with other companies, and give users control over what Gemini can have access to.\n\u201cWe\u2019re infusing A.I. into everything we do,\u201d Sameer Samat, Google\u2019s president of the Android Ecosystem, wrote in a blog post. \u201cIn order for A.I. to be truly helpful, it should naturally fit into our everyday lives, and the best place to experience that is on your Android device.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s chief executive, started 2023 by declaring it the \u201cyear of efficiency.\u201d Like several of its big tech peers, Meta cut jobs and mothballed expansion plans.\nThen came A.I.\nMr. Zuckerberg started this year saying his company would spend more than $30 billion in 2024 on new tech infrastructure. In April, he raised that to $35 billion. On Wednesday, he increased it to at least $37 billion. And he said Meta would spend even more next year.\nMr. Zuckerberg said he\u2019d rather build too fast \u201crather than too late,\u201d and allow his competitors to get a big lead in the A.I. race.\nThe tech industry\u2019s biggest companies have made it clear over the last week that they have no intention of throttling their stunning levels of spending on artificial intelligence, even though investors are getting worried that a big payoff is further down the line than once thought.\nIn the last quarter alone, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet spent a combined $59 billion on capital expenses, 63 percent more than a year earlier and 161 percent more than four years ago. A large part of that was funneled into building data centers and packing them with new computer systems to build artificial intelligence. Only Apple has not dramatically increased spending because it does not build the most advanced A.I. systems itself.\nCapital expenditures in the latest quarter were up 63 percent from a year earlier.\nSource: FactSet and company filings\nKaren Weise\nIf investors are getting anxious, they\u2019re going to have to learn to cope with their nerves. Last week, Alphabet\u2019s share price dropped more than 5 percent after it reported a 91 percent increase in capital expenses. But Sundar Pichai, Alphabet\u2019s chief executive, made the case for patience.\n\u201cThese things take time,\u201d he said, and \u201cthe risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.\u201d\nThe leaders of the biggest tech companies see a once-in-a-generation opportunity in the generative A.I. technology behind the popular chatbots like ChatGPT. They believe it can revolutionize everything from the software that runs the complex operations of global companies to research on new drugs.\nWhen ChatGPT debuted in late 2022, tech giants were beginning to dial back a burst of spending from the pandemic. But the industry\u2019s brief embrace of austerity went out the window when they saw the potential of artificial intelligence.\nThis new wave of A.I. is wildly expensive. The systems work with vast amounts of data and require sophisticated computer chips and new data centers to develop the technology and serve it to customers. The companies are seeing some sales from their A.I. work, but it is barely moving the needle financially.\nIn recent months, several high-profile tech industry watchers, including Goldman Sachs\u2019shead of equity researchand a partner at the venture firm Sequoia Capital, have questioned when or if A.I. will ever produce enough benefit to bring in the sales needed to cover its staggering costs. It is not clear that A.I. will come close to having the same impact as the internet or mobile phones, Goldman\u2019s Jim Covello wrote in a June report.\n\u201cWhat $1 trillion problem will A.I. solve?\u201d he wrote. \u201cReplacing low wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions I\u2019ve witnessed in my 30 years of closely following the tech industry.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s parent company was the first big tech outfit to report its earnings for April through June, and it added weight to those overspending concerns. Though Alphabet had a 29 percent jump in profit, sales for ads on YouTube, which Google owns, were lower than expected and the massive jump in infrastructure spending \u2014 Google spent an average of $145 million each day in the quarter \u2014 rattled investors.\nMicrosoft was up next. As OpenAI\u2019s largest investor, it had a jump on its peers and had been raising its capital spending every quarter since the start of last year. On Tuesday, Microsoft had a bit of unwelcome news: Its cloud computing business, where most of that A.I. work was being done, didn\u2019t grow as fast as expected.\nBut instead of serving as a moment of caution, the miss (about one percentage point below what was expected) added fuel to the building frenzy. Executives said that Microsoft had more demand for A.I. than they could serve from their data centers, a problem that they expect will persist through the end of the year. That helped explain why they are building so furiously.\nSatya Nadella, Microsoft\u2019s chief executive, said much of the capital spending went to acquire physical land and buildings, which they need to lock up in advance. But the remaining 60 percent was for what he called \u201cthe kit,\u201d the expensive chips and other components of a computer network.\nMicrosoft\u2019s executives also asked for patience, saying the spending would bring in revenue over a long time \u2014 \u201cover 15 years and beyond,\u201d said Amy Hood, the company\u2019s financial chief. Digging into Microsoft\u2019s numbers indicates that the company is on track for more than $5 billion in sales for generative A.I. products this year. But for a tech giant that just reported $245 billion in annual revenue, that\u2019s still tiny.\n(The New York Times hassued OpenAIand Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit\u2019s claims.)\nThe next day, Metaincreased its predictions for how much it would spend. Mr. Zuckerberg said he was planning for the next generation of A.I. systems, and the next major update to their main A.I. model will demand 10 times more computing power.\nMeta gives away the advanced A.I. systems it develops, but Mr. Zuckerberg still said it was worth it. \u201cPart of what\u2019s important about A.I. is that it can be used to improve all of our products in almost every way,\u201d he said.\nOn Thursday, Amazon told investors it had spent more than $30 billion on capital expenses in the first half of the year, and that it too would spend more in the rest of the year. Executives said they need to balance building enough to meet demand without getting ahead of what they really need.\n\u201cThe reality right now is that while we\u2019re investing a significant amount in the A.I. space and in infrastructure, we would like to have more capacity than we already have today,\u201d said Andy Jassy, Amazon\u2019s chief executive. \u201cI mean, we have a lot of demand right now.\u201d\nThat means buying land, building data centers and all the computers, chips and gear that go into them. Amazon executives put a positive spin on all that spending. \u201cWe use that to drive revenue and free cash flow for the next decade and beyond,\u201d said Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s finance chief.\nThere are plenty of signs the boom will persist. In mid-July, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which makes most of the in-demand chips designed by Nvidia that are used in A.I. systems, said those chips would be in scarce supply until the end of 2025.\nMr. Zuckerberg said A.I.\u2019s potential is \u201csuper exciting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s why there are all the jokes about how all the tech C.E.O.s get on these earnings calls,\u201d he said, \u201cand just talk about A.I. the whole time.\u201d\nMike IsaacandTripp Micklecontributed reporting."

        "title": "Apple and Nvidia in Talks to Invest in OpenAI",
        "fulltext": "Apple and the chipmaker Nvidia are in talks to invest in OpenAI as part of a new deal that would value the San Francisco artificial intelligence start-up at $100 billion, according to three people familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nThe deal would beled by Thrive Capitaland might also include Microsoft. Thrive would put about $1 billion into OpenAI, the people said.\nA $100 billion valuation would be about a $20 billion increase from OpenAI\u2019s valuation eight months ago.\nNvidia and Apple declined to comment.\nOpenAI started the A.I. boom with the release of the online chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022. In the months that followed, investors pumped tens of billions of dollars into the start-up and other companies that were developing similar technologies.\nIn recent months, investors\u2019 interest has cooled as several prominent start-ups essentially disappeared into tech giants like Google, Amazon and Microsoft. But OpenAI has remained an independent operation intent on building and selling its own technologies and products.\nSince 2019, Microsoft and others have invested over $13 billion in the start-up, which needs billions of dollars in raw computing power to build its A.I. technologies. Nvidia, which supplies much of that computing power in the form of specialized computer chips suited to the development of A.I., has experienced dramatic growth over the last 18 months. On Wednesday,Nvidia reported that its sales and profithad more than doubled during the three months that ended in July.\nEarly this year, Thrive led a deal that valued OpenAI at more than $80 billion. With that deal, the start-up did not issue new shares. The company allowed its employees to sell their existing shares.\nThe new deal would allow other existing shareholders to sell their shares as well.\nNvidia\u2019s involvement in the talks was reported earlier byBloomberg. Apple\u2019s involvement was reported earlier byThe Wall Street Journal. (The New York Times sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement last year, saying that the companies used news articles to train their models without permission.)\nWhile Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI have been at the forefront of A.I. development for years, Apple has lagged behind. It recently announced that it would soon allow customers to use OpenAI\u2019s chatbot on the iPhone.\nIn June, Apple unveiled its plan to add generative A.I. to devices. The technology, which it calls Apple Intelligence, will improve its Siri virtual assistant, automatically prioritize messages and offer writing tools that proofread or suggest sentences for emails, notes or text.\nThe company is expected to provide more details on the technology on Sept. 9 when it hosts an event to unveil its newest iPhones at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif."
