Facebook, Apple and Amazon have endured the greatest declines, all down $250 billion or more from their respective peaks.\nThat is a marked reversal for one of the most popular trades on Wall Street. Investors piled into shares of the largest tech companies, betting their revenue would continue to grow strongly as these behemoths upended industries from retail to communication to media.\nBy the end of August, the market value of Apple and Amazon had each surpassed $1 trillion, and Alphabet was flirting with $900 billion. The combined market value of the five had reached $3.6 trillion.\nBut worries about global economic growth as well as lackluster earnings and outlooks the past two quarters have shaken investors\u2019 confidence. In particular, concerns have mounted about how many new iPhones Apple will manage to sell. Facebook has spent much of the year mired in scandal, raising the specter that the United States government will tighten regulation of big tech. All of that has investors questioning whether the values of these big tech companies have become too lofty.\n[Technology stocks drove a slump that erased November\u2019s gains, as concerns about growth and privacy issues took an increasing toll.]\nOf course, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet have faced steep sell-offs before, only to bounce back quickly.

        "title": "Apple Raises Prices, and Profits Keep Booming",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since Apple introduced the iPhone 11 years ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous, and the market for them is saturated. To maintain growth, Apple has employed a shrewd strategy: Charge more for the devices.\nJournalists and analysts have explained how Apple is doing that by dividing the number of iPhones sold in a given quarter into the revenue Apple earns from them to calculate the average selling price.\nThat\u2019s not going to be so easy anymore.\nApple said Thursday that it sold about as many iPhones in the latest quarter as it did a year earlier but that iPhone revenue rose 29 percent. That was because customers paid nearly 29 percent more for the devices. (The average selling price is now $793.)\nThe price increase helped propel Apple\u2019s profits 32 percent higher, to $14.13 billion.\nBut after those figures were reported, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that the company would no longer disclose how many iPhones, iPads or Mac computers it sold. As a result, journalists and analysts will no longer be able to track how Apple\u2019s swelling prices are improving its profits.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, explained the rationale with an analogy: \u201cIf you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier \u2014 and she says or he says, \u2018How many units do you have in there?\u2019 \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what\u2019s in the cart.\u201d\nToni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Bernstein, said Apple was trying to shift investors\u2019 attention away from the number of devices it sold. \u201cCompanies always try to put their best foot forward,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir best foot doesn\u2019t appear to be iPhone unit growth.\u201d\nAnother wildly profitable quarter for Apple showed its business has mostly avoided the turbulence that has roiled its Silicon Valley peers. Facebook, Google and Twitter have faced questions about their influence in the spread of disinformation and the proliferation of hate speech.\nApple has tried to separate itself from other tech giants by trumpeting that it values its customers\u2019 privacy and hires people to curate its services rather than relying on computer algorithms. The company responded to criticism about the addictive nature of its smartphones by adding tools for people to track their time spent on them.\nLast month, Apple released its most expensive iPhone ever, the XS Max, which starts at $1,100. On Tuesday, it raised the starting price of its iPad Pro to $800 from $650 and of its MacBook Air to $1,200 from $1,000, while also making the devices faster and more powerful.\nApple\u2019s strategy has worked for more than iPhones. Apple said that it sold 5.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, down 2 percent from a year ago, but that its revenues from Mac sales rose 3 percent to a record $7.4 billion. That was because customers paid nearly $1,400 on average for a Mac, up 5 percent from a year earlier.\nApple\u2019s overall revenue increased nearly 20 percent in the quarter to $62.9 billion.\nApple\u2019s other bet to maintain growth is its services business, which includes its cut of app sales and revenue from its own apps, like Apple Music, among other things. Services revenue rose 17 percent to nearly $10 billion in the quarter.\nSome analysts were concerned about Apple\u2019s prospects in China, where sales fell sharply several years ago. But revenues in the quarter there rose 16 percent from a year earlier.\nApple\u2019s share price was down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading Thursday, likely because of its plans to stop reporting unit sales and because its revenue guidance for the current quarter was \u201clighter than expectations,\u201d Mr. Sacconaghi said."

        "title": "Did You Know Dieter Rams Designed a Handbag?",
        "fulltext": "Apple is hardly the only consumer products company to assert that elegant design can elevate the most ordinary of functional objects. Before there was the iPhone, or even the Mac, there were the sleek and simple coffee pots, radios, electric toothbrushes and shavers of Braun, the German electronics brand, used inmillionsof homes around the world. The company\u2019s secret weapon of four-plus decades?Dieter Rams, an industrial designer, a master of modernism and a majorrole model for Jonathan Ive(a.k.a. Apple\u2019s design guru).\nLike Mr. Ive, who branched into the luxury lifestyle space with thelaunch of the Apple Watchin 2015, Mr. Rams, 86, also had a brief flirtation with fashion. Back in 1963, he created a leather handbag as a surprise gift for his wife, Ingeborg. Smooth and boxy, with a short curved strap on the outside but a highly functional and compartmentalized interior, it was never produced or seen by the outside world. Now, 55 years later, the 931 (as the bag has been named by Mr. Rams) is finally coming to market.\n\u201cThis design was a very personal matter and not intended for public use,\u201d Mr. Rams said this week ahead of the bag\u2019s Nov. 30 release date.But then he met withEsther Schulze-Tsatsas and Dimitrios Tsatsas, the couple behindTsatsas, an accessories label based in Frankfurt that makes understated, sculptural accessories. Impressed, he started to reconsider his own brief foray into luxury leather goods.\n\u201cThey were both very pleasant people who endeavored to produce good and enduring designs, which is why I agreed to the re-edition of what is essentially a very private design,\u201d Mr. Rams said. There was, he said, another compelling reason that eventually prompted him to change his mind: \u201cI wished to dedicate the handbag to Ingeborg, who has been my companion for so long and who has always been my alter ego,\u201d he said. \u201cBy making this public now, it is also a homage to her.\u201d\nUsing Mr. Rams\u2019s original 931 designs, Ms. Schulze-Tsatsas said that they had needed to change very little to update the bag for a 21st-century lifestyle.\n\u201cWe added an extra shoulder strap to make it hands-free, tweaked the lining to become a soft blue nappa, and created an interior zip pocket, but the exterior remains untouched,\u201d Ms. Schulze-Tsatsas said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to do anything to it. For us the project was a dream come true. Mr. Rams is like a God to us.\u201d\nOn Friday, the 931 will be available on the Tsatsas website and the company\u2019s Frankfurt store. It costs 900 euros, or around $1,025, and will be available in black and gray calfskin.\n\u201cNeedless to say I designed the bag the way I did all other things \u2014 albeit perhaps I was a bit more emotional as it was more personal,\u201d said Mr. Rams said, referring to the design\u2019s original intended use.\nThe handbag\u2019s reveal coincides with the release ofthe critically acclaimed documentary\u201cRams,\u201d directed by Gary Hustwit. The film hammers home the idea that Mr. Rams all but invented consumer product design as we know it today.\nWhen asked whether the handbag could lead to future forays in the accessories space, he said, \u201cI believe I have now designed enough.\u201d\nIndeed, he is not a great admirer of fashion in general.\n\u201cJil Sander is the only haute couturier to impress me,\u201d Mr. Rams said of the German fashion designer who paved the way for sophisticated minimalism with the introduction of her namesake label in 1968, and collections featuring strong tailoring and androgynous separates. \u201cI believe we have a similar outlook on things.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple wasworth more than $1 trillionat the start of November. Now, it\u2019s valued at $880 billion.\nThe mighty tech titans and their seemingly endless pipeline of profits, which powered one of the longest bull markets in stocks, are looking a little less invincible. Shares of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, are down more than 10 percent since the market peaked, while Facebook and Amazon have dropped more than 20 percent.\nInvestors\u2019 faith has been eroded by slowing growth and a trade war with China, as well as a steady stream of revelations aboutprivacy lapses, security issues andmismanagement. If tech stocks cannot shake the fears, the rest of the market could feel the pain.\nThe sheer bulk of the technology companies gives themoutsize influence over the market\u2014 in both directions. The tumult in tech on Monday pushed major stock market indexes into negative territory for November, leaving investors clinging to a gain of less than 1 percent for the year.\nThe sentiment spilled over intoEuropean and Asianmarkets on Tuesday, with European blue-chip stocks reaching the lowest mark in about three weeks. In Asia, trade concerns helped to push the stocks of Chinese semiconductor makers and other big technology companies into the red.\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing extreme selling in the only favored area that everybody ran to,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York.\nThe stock market would seem disconnected from therest of the American economy. Unemployment remains low and growth is on track for its best annual performance since 2005. Third-quarter profits in the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 28 percent, according to data company Refinitiv.\nBut investors are increasingly skittish about companies\u2019 prospects.EuropeandChinaare facing economic weakness, while margins could be pinched by higher interest rates and rising labor costs.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a slowdown underway globally,\u201d said James Bianco, president of financial market research firm Bianco Research in Chicago. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely been stronger than the rest of the world. But the fear is, that can\u2019t hold. If the rest of the world slows down, that will eventually slow us, too.\u201d\nShares in industrial companies, viewed as particularly vulnerable to rising trade tensions with China, have dropped more than 10 percent since September. Economically sensitivefinancialstocks have slid 7.5 percent. Shares of homebuilders, which are vulnerable to rising rates, have fallen more than 30 percent.\nThe potential for higher borrowing costs is also weighing on smaller companies that often borrow money by issuing floating rate debt, which can become more difficult to pay off as interest rates rise. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks is down 14 percent from its high.\n\u201cThis is simply a continuation of the recent repricing of risk, or growth scare, that we\u2019ve basically been seeing since the end of September,\u201d said Talley Leger, an equity strategist with Oppenheimer Funds.\nWhen the stock market hit its peak in September, technology had led the way, accounting for 50 percent of the gains for the year. The tech giants, at first, seemed immune to the sell-off that followed on broader economic worries.\nNot anymore. Through Friday, roughly a quarter of the market\u2019s decline since September was because of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet, according to data collected by S&P Capital IQ. The sharp sell-off on Monday will only add to that tally.\nInvestors appear especially focused on any signs that extraordinary profits generated by these giant tech companies are under threat.\nThe specter of regulation is looming over the shares of Facebook, as it deals with the fallout and costs from a data breach, privacy lapses and management missteps. The pressure has only been amplified by renewedscrutiny overits response to Russian efforts to use it to influence the 2016 presidential election. The stock dropped another 5.7 percent on Monday.\nAlphabet likewise faces a regulatory crack down on business practices in Europe, and concern from elected officials in the United Statesabout political bias. Its shares fell nearly 4 percent Monday.\nRegulation broadly is worrying technology investors. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, has been warning that the new rules for the industry are \u201cinevitable,\u201d as he told Axios in an interview that aired on Sunday.\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in the free market. But we have to admit when the free market is notworking,\u201d he said, \u201cI think the Congress and the administration at some point will pass something.\u201d\nWhether technology stocks can slough off the worries will depend, in part, on whether the companies can continue to deliver strong earnings growth even if the global economy does soften significantly. Recent earnings reports from major tech companies have done little to reassure investors.\nSoft demandfor Apple\u2019s new phones has hurt its shares and those of its suppliers. The month started with Apple issuing a lower-than-expected forecast for sales. Last week, a supplier warned investors that one of its biggest customers had cut orders.\nSince Apple\u2019s share price peaked at just over $232 on Oct. 3, the stock has plummeted by nearly 20 percent, lopping more than $200 billion off the company\u2019s market value. Its shares were down nearly 4 percent Monday.\nAmazon reported a slowdown in its core retail revenue growth in late October, sending the shares lower. To investors, who often view revenue numbers as a good gauge of the strength of demand in the economy, that was more important than the $2.9 billion in profit the company reported.\nBut if they actually produce the numbers that Wall Street analysts expect, the recent slump in large technology stocks could present a buying opportunity for some investors. Key valuation measures of Apple and Alphabet hit multiyear highs this summer. But the recent drop has left those valuations substantially lower. Prices of Facebook and Amazon are relatively low compared with expected profits, meaning these stocks look \u201ccheap\u201d for certain investors.\nBut they might have to get even cheaper before investors are tempted to snap them up. That\u2019s why some expect the sentiment in the market to get much worse before stocks can resume their climb.\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of looking for a little more bearishness,\u201d said King Lip, chief strategist at the wealth management company Baker Avenue."

        "title": "The Essentials for Covering Silicon Valley: Burner Phones and Doorbells",
        "fulltext": "How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jack Nicas, a technology reporter for The Times in San Francisco, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.\nYou write about Apple and other Silicon Valley companies. What are your most important tools for reporting?\nReporting is not typically sexy. We spend a lot of time sending emails, leaving voice mail messages, chasing dead ends and trying to persuade people to tell us stuff they shouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have any shiny gadgets you see in spy movies. Some of my most reliable reporting tools are a pen and paper.\nArguably my most interesting gadget for a time was a flip phone I bought from Target. Burner phones are great for talking to paranoid sources, contacting unsavory characters or trying to reach people who are screening my calls. But now, of course, there\u2019s an app for that. It\u2019s called Burner and it lets you make calls and send texts with different phone numbers. I can even pick the area code so my subject thinks I\u2019m calling from nearby, just like the spammers! (We have a lot in common, some people say.) For sensitive communications, I still use Signal, the encrypted messaging and calling app.\nI\u2019m also a prolific screenshotter. The internet is an ephemeral place, so when I see something online for a story, I make sure to capture it immediately. The technique has been crucial for documentingfake Facebook accounts,dark YouTube recommendations,wrong Google answers,bizarre Google Maps neighborhoods. I use the FireShot plug-in for Google Chrome and my iPhone\u2019s built-in screenshot and screen-recording tool.\nI record some interviews with TapeACall Pro, an app that requires dialing in a third number that records the call\u2019s audio. But because that can store the audio in the cloud, for sensitive calls I revert to a tangled setup that involves a decade-old Olympus WS-400S voice recorder, headphones and an auxiliary cord. That keeps the audio on a recorder that never connects to the internet. For particularly sensitive conversations, I ditch all of that and try to meet in person.\nI typically bike to meetings and am an avid user of San Francisco\u2019s shared-bike programs. I do notride scooters, thankfully, because otherwise I know this article would have ended up with a photo of me on one.\nIf I had to choose one favorite old-school reporting technology though, I\u2019d pick the doorbell.\nWhen has going door to door helped with your reporting? And when did it not work out so well?\nWhen I covered crime in Boston and Florida, I typically knocked on doors to find families and friends of victims. That often led to harrowing but fruitful interviews. Now I\u2019m usually trying to find people who don\u2019t want to be found \u2014 and that sometimes means I\u2019m not well received.\nThat was the case on one of my first door-knocking experiences. My professor at Boston University, Dick Lehr, a longtime investigative reporter, took me under his wing to examine a 30-year-old questionable arson murder conviction. We showed up to the apartment of the man we suspected had actually started the fire in question. He was home, and appeared to be on drugs. We were invited in and, as we questioned where he was the night of the crime, we eyed a large knife on his table. When he became belligerent because I began writing, we left.\nIn a past life you covered Google. Now you cover Apple. So, iPhone or Android?\nI\u2019ve had both and have a controversial opinion: They\u2019re basically the same. (Apple will not like this answer.) The top phones for either operating system are excellent, easy-to-use devices with virtually the same features and apps. The biggest difference is the business model.\nHow so?\nApple makes money by selling consumers expensive iPhones. Google makes money by giving away its Android software and services \u2014 and then charging advertisers for access to the billions of users it attracts.\nGoogle\u2019s approach has given it enormous data about the world and its inhabitants. Google is well positioned to use its mass collection of personal data for new products, like artificial intelligence, but it also draws new scrutiny to the company.\nApple\u2019s less data-focused approach has allowed it to take the high road on privacy. That strategy has potentially insulated the company from regulations and public scorn, but it also could leave Apple with dumber products than its rivals.\nInternet trolls have targeted you for your coverage. What happened and how did you fend them off?\nI wrote a series of articles when I previously worked for The Wall Street Journal about problems with YouTube\u2019s algorithms that led the company to make changes that affected some YouTube video creators. One YouTube star accused me of doctoring evidence, and thousands then descended on my Twitter account and flooded my email inbox with hate mail and death threats.\nWhile Journal security and I monitored the attacks for any credible threats, I found a very effective approach to frustrating the trolls: ignore them. Their oxygen is attention, so when they realized I wasn\u2019t going to respond or get upset, they moved along.\nOutside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with?\nIn a shameless plug, I am a fan ofthe NYT Cooking app. I recently used it to makedoner kebab in the oven, an old favorite from late nights in Berlin, where I lived before on a journalism fellowship. While I hail from a long line of chefs, and my wife is an excellent one too, I\u2019m not. The app provides a terrific mix of elegant-but-doable dishes. I just wish it would let me input the ingredients I have on hand and return a recipe I can cook without a trip to the store.\nMy wife and I have also become frequent users of our voice-controlled speaker, the Google Home, for music, news and weather reports. I constantly test it with questions and am often pleased,or puzzled, by the answers it returns. My wife, a self-described Luddite, initially teased me for talking to an inanimate object. Now she excitedly, and a bit ironically, greets it when we return home from a trip.\n\u201cThanks,\u201d it replies. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see you, too.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "For more than a year, Facebook has endured cascadingcrises\u2014 over Russian misinformation, data privacy and abusive content \u2014 that transformed the Silicon Valley icon into an embattled giant accused ofcorporate overreach andnegligence.\nAn investigation by The New York Timesrevealed how Facebook fought back against its critics: with delays, denials and a full-bore campaign in Washington. Here are six takeaways.\nIn fall 2016, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, was publicly declaring ita \u201ccrazy idea\u201d that his company had played a role in deciding the election. But security experts at the company already knew otherwise.\nThey found signs as early as spring 2016 that Russian hackers were poking around the Facebook accounts of people linked to American presidential campaigns. Months later, they saw Russian-controlled accounts sharing information fromhacked Democratic emailswith reporters. Facebook accumulated evidence of Russian activity for over a year before executives opted to share what they knew with the public \u2014 and even their own board of directors.\nIn 2015, when the presidential candidate Donald J. Trumpcalled for a banof Muslim immigrants, Facebook employees and outside critics called on the company to punish Mr. Trump. Mr. Zuckerberg considered it \u2014 asking subordinates whether Mr. Trump had violated the company\u2019s rules and whether his account should be suspended or the post removed.\nBut while Mr. Zuckerberg was personally offended, he deferred to subordinates who warned that penalizing Mr. Trump would set off a damaging backlash among Republicans.\nMr. Trump\u2019s post remained up.\nAs criticism grew overFacebook\u2019s belated admissions of Russian influence,the company launched a lobbying campaign \u2014 overseen by Sheryl Sandberg, the company\u2019s chief operating officer \u2014 to combat critics and shift anger toward rival tech firms.\nFacebook hired Senator Mark Warner\u2019s former chief of staff to lobby him; Ms. Sandberg personally called Senator Amy Klobuchar to complain about her criticism. The company also deployed a public relations firm to push negative stories about its political critics and cast blame on companies like Google.\nThose efforts included depicting the billionaire liberal donor George Soros as the force behind a broad anti-Facebook movement, and publishing stories praising Facebook and criticizing Google and Apple on a conservative news site.\nFacebook faced worldwide outrage in March after The Times, The Observer of London and The Guardian publisheda joint investigationinto how user data had been appropriated by Cambridge Analytica to profile American voters. But inside Facebook, executives thought they could contain the damage. The company installed a new chief of American lobbying to help quell the bipartisan anger in Congress, and it quietly shelved an internal communications campaign, called \u201cWe Get It,\u201d meant to assure employees that the company was committed to getting back on track in 2018.\nSensing Facebook\u2019s vulnerability, some rival tech firms in Silicon Valley sought to use the outcry to promote their own brands. After Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, quipped in an interview that his company did not traffic in personal data, Mr. Zuckerberg ordered his management team to use only Android phones. After all, he reasoned, the operating system had far more users than Apple\u2019s.\nWashington\u2019s senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, raisedmore money from Facebook employeesthan any other member of Congress during the 2016 election cycle \u2014 and he was there when the company needed him.\nThis past summer, as Facebook\u2019s troubles mounted, Mr. Schumer confronted Mr. Warner, who by then had emerged as Facebook\u2019s most insistent inquisitor in Congress. Back off, Mr. Schumer told Mr. Warner, and look for ways to work with Facebook, not vilify it. Lobbyists for Facebook \u2014 which also employs Mr. Schumer\u2019s daughter \u2014 were kept abreast of Mr. Schumer\u2019s efforts."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Tim Miller, a longtime Republican political operative, moved to the Bay Area last year to set up a public relations shop, he brought with him tradecraft more typical of Washington than Silicon Valley.\nHe was well versed in opposition research \u2014 the pursuit of damaging intelligence about a political enemy. He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy.\nMr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech\u2019s biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.\nDefiners quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller\u2019s work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.\nWhile working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the Trump administration.\nThe campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley\u2019s already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.\n\u201cThis type of dirty P.R.? It\u2019s always been there, but it\u2019s definitely on the upswing,\u201d said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations representative for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. \u201cThe idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.\u201d\nFacebook fired Definers last weekafter The New York Times detailed the workMr. Miller\u2019s firm had done on behalf of the social media company. Definers encouraged reporters to write about the financial connections between anti-Facebook activists and the liberal financier George Soros, drawing accusations that it was relying on anti-Semitic tropes.\nDefiners\u2019s strategy played to a target\u2019s pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.\nDefiners employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled \u201cApple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators\u201d that detailed how Apple\u2019s activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.\nQualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe feuds among the tech industry\u2019s giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.\nA campaign by Microsoft, referred to as \u201cScroogled,\u201d highlighted what it called Google\u2019s privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people\u2019s emails, a charge the internet company denied.\nGoogle has more recently been targeted withnegative storiestipped to reporters by a group called the Campaign for Accountability. The group was quietlyfunded by the database maker Oracle, which has spent years in an intellectual property court fight with Google over Java, a programming tool owned by Oracle.\nMatt Rhoades, Definers\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement that the firm\u2019s work \u201cis absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.\u201d\nJuul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.\nThe ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.\nAnd the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.\nSome details of Definers\u2019s relationships with tech firms, including Lyft and Lime, havepreviouslybeenreported byother news organizations.\nDefiners also plied its services for Washington. It helped set up Power the Future, a pro-oil trade group, while it also worked for the Environmental Protection Agency. The E.P.A.ended its contractwith Definers last year after it was revealed that a Definers lawyer was investigating agency employees critical of the Trump administration.\nTo promote clients and attack its clients\u2019 enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.\nDefiners and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as \u201ca master of opposition research\u201d in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.\nMr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times\u2019s report last week. \u201cWe do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,\u201d they wrote in a blog post.\nBut Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled \u201cDigital Platform Echo Chamber.\u201d\n\u201cDefiners manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,\u201d he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.\nThis year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm\u2019s complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips.\n\u201cThe iPhone 8 Might Be Slower Than the Competition. Here\u2019s Why\u201d read a headline onan April 2017 story. NTK\u2019s answer? The iPhones don\u2019t use Qualcomm chips.\nOther stories were even more direct, likeone from Augustabout Qualcomm\u2019s technology that concluded: \u201cFor Apple, the choice will be clear: make nice with Qualcomm, or offer a slower, inferior product to consumers.\u201d\nMr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. \u201cWhat NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,\u201d he added.\nDefiners also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times.\nHe emailed the piece to the right-wing provocateur Charles C. Johnson, according to the email, whopublished it on his website GotNewswithout a byline or other disclosures that it came from Mr. Miller, Definers or Qualcomm.\nMr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. \u201cTwo years into the administration it\u2019s clear we were right,\u201d he added.\nMr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller\u2019s criticism of Mr. Trump.\nDefiners\u2019s focus on Mr. Cook extended to a campaign it ran to promote the Apple chief as a 2020 presidential candidate. A slick website titled \u201cDraft Tim Cook 2020\u201d had digital links to Definers employees, said Kyle Ehmke, a cybersecurity researcher for the firm ThreatConnect.\nIn a memomade public by Facebookon Wednesday, Elliot Schrage, Facebook\u2019s communications and policy chief, assumed responsibility for hiring Definers and said Facebook asked the P.R. firm to investigate whether Mr. Soros had \u201cfinancial motivation\u201d to criticize Facebook.\nMr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials."

        "title": "How to Survive the Next Era of Tech (Slow Down and Be Mindful)",
        "fulltext": "Nearly five years ago,in my very first State of the Art column, I offered a straightforward plan for how to survive what was shaping up to be a turbulent time in the tech world.\nAt the time, technology felt thrilling and world-changing. You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \u201cThe Jetsons\u201d \u2014 and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder.\nBut tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things \u2014 every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps \u2014 that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.\nSo to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.\nNow the time has come to amend and update that advice \u2014 which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I\u2019m not going far: I\u2019ll be writing for The New York Times\u2019s Opinion section starting next year.)\nThe tech industry in 2018 is far more consequential than it was in 2014, when I started thisjob. It\u2019s bigger, more pervasive and in every way more dangerous. It is also less amenable to outside pressure: The companies that run the show are more powerful than ever, and in many cases governments \u2014 especially in the United States \u2014 have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses.\nHow should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.\nNot long ago \u2014 in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \u201ccloud\u201d \u2014 wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn\u2019t work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?\nSomething strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.\nBut ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?\nMy advice: Don\u2019t just consider how well a product works, but look at who\u2019s making it and how it is sold. Before you dive into any new doodad, consider a company\u2019s ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren\u2019t comfortable, look to alternatives. (Last year, for instance,I switched to Lyft from Uber, and I\u2019ve never looked back.) Most important, when you\u2019re choosing tech, it\u2019s wise to consider thebusiness model\u2014 because it\u2019s in the buying and the selling of a product, rather than in the using, that you can best figure out its dangers.\nFor instance: Even though Google\u2019s Pixel line of phones is very good \u2014 a far more affordable option with some features that iPhone users might kill for \u2014 I stick with Apple\u2019s phones because I appreciate the simplicity of the trade. I pay Apple a huge sum of money for the device, and ittakes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges.\nI don\u2019t doubt Google\u2019s capacity to make great devices. But because Google makes most of its money from ads, and because theinternet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online, I\u2019d rather not fall deeper into that swamp.\nSimilarly, I found Facebook\u2019s new video-chatting machine, Portal, tobe very good, but I\u2019ll never buy it. Besides Facebook\u2019s dependence on targeted ads, the company has repeatedly breached its users\u2019 trust, not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy. Portal is nice, but it\u2019s notthatnice.\nOne thing that hasn\u2019t changed in the last five years is who\u2019s running the show. When I started writing this column, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft were tech\u2019s biggest and most influential companies. Today, even withrecent stock-market troubles, the same five giants sit at the top of the world.\nI\u2019ve railed against this sort of concentration again and again \u2014 the tech giants\u2019 increasing dominationruins innovation, undermines consumer choice and generally makes a lot of the industry ungovernable. Lawmakers around the world are now taking notice, and it\u2019s possible that in the next five years, we\u2019ll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths\u2019 size and scope.\nBut you don\u2019t have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too \u2014 and for a better, healthier tech industry, it\u2019s best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.\nHere\u2019s one example: Even though I like Apple\u2019s hardware and appreciate its business model, I\u2019ve stayed away from Apple Music, its subscription streaming service. For me,Spotify is superiorin just about every way. Its app works better (its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good), it releases innovative features at a faster clip, and its songs play on more types of devices.\nBest of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry.\nThere are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices \u2014 so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple\u2019s service but not from Spotify. But it\u2019s precisely this sort of mischief that I\u2019m hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.\nThere are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys. You can use Dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with Apple and Google. Rather than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I write inUlysses, a lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big-tech competitor. Whatever tech you\u2019re in the market for, there\u2019s most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.\nOne reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.\nThe lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.\nThat\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.\nYes, tech could make everything better. But we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse \u2014 how self-driving cars could induce sprawl, howthe \u201cinternet of things\u201d could provoke apocalypse, how social media could ruin democracy.\nAre these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow."

        "title": "Microsoft Is Worth as Much as Apple. How Did That Happen?",
        "fulltext": "Just a few years ago, Microsoft was seen as a lumbering has-been of the technology world.\nIt was big and still quite profitable, but the company had lost its luster, failing or trailing in the markets of the future like mobile, search, online advertising and cloud computing. Its stock price languished, inching up 3 percent in the decade through the end of 2012.\nIt\u2019s a very different story today. Microsoft is running neck and neck with Apple for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company, both worth about $850 billion, thanks to a stock price that has climbed 30 percent over the last 12 months. At the end of trading Friday, Microsoft was just ahead of its longtime rival.\nSo what happened?\nThere is a short-term explanation for Microsoft\u2019s market rise, and there is a longer-term one.\nThe near-term, stock-trading answer is that Microsoft has held up better than others during the recent sell-off of tech company shares. Apple investors are worried about a slowdown in iPhone sales. Facebook and Google face persistent attacks on their role in distributing false news and conspiracy theories, and investor concerns that their privacy policies could scare off users and advertisers.\nBut the more enduring and important answer is that Microsoft has become a case study of how a once-dominant company can build on its strengths and avoid being a prisoner of its past. It has fully embraced cloud computing, abandoned an errant foray into smartphones and returned to its roots as mainly a supplier of technology to business customers.\nThat strategy was outlined by Satya Nadella shortly after hebecame chief executivein 2014. Since then, Microsoft\u2019s stock price has nearly tripled.\nMicrosoft\u2019s path to cloud computing \u2014 processing, storage and software delivered as a service over the internet from remote data centers \u2014 was lengthy and sometimes halting.\nIts forerunners to cloud computing go back to the 1990s, with Microsoft\u2019s MSN online service and later its Bing search engine. In 2010, four years after Amazon entered the cloud market, Microsoft introduced its cloud service. But it did not have an offering comparable to Amazon\u2019s until 2013, analysts say.\nEven then, Microsoft\u2019s cloud service was a side business. The corporate center of gravity remained its Windows operating system, the linchpin of the company\u2019s wealth and power during the personal computer era. That changed after Mr. Nadella replaced Steven A. Ballmer, who had been chief executive for 14 years.\nMr. Nadella made the cloud service a top priority, and the company is now astrong No.2 to Amazon. Microsoft has nearly doubled its share of that market to 13 percent since the end of 2015, according to the Synergy Research Group. Amazon\u2019s share has held steady at 33 percent over that span.\nMicrosoft has also retooled its popular Office apps like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in a cloud version, Office 365. That offering caters to people who prefer to use software as an internet service and gives Microsoft a competitive entry against online app suppliers like Google.\nThe financial payoff from the shift came gradually at first, but is accelerating. In the year that ended in June, Microsoft\u2019s revenue rose 15 percent, to $110 billion, and operating profit increased 13 percent, to $35 billion.\n\u201cThe essence of what Satya Nadella did was the dramatic shift to the cloud,\u201d said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. \u201cHe put Microsoft back into a high-growth business.\u201d\nIt is the perception that Microsoft is on a high-growth track that has fueled its rising share price.\nWhen Microsoftacquired Nokia\u2019s mobile phone businessin 2013, Mr. Ballmer hailed the move as a \u201cbold step into the future.\u201d Two years later, Mr. Nadellawalked away from that future, taking a $7.6 billion charge, nearly the entire value of the purchase, and shedding 7,800 workers.\nMicrosoft would not try to compete with the smartphone technology leaders, Apple, Google and Samsung. Instead, Microsoft focused on its developing apps and other software for business customers.\nMicrosoft does have a successful consumer franchise in its Xbox video game business. But it is a separate unit, and though it generates revenue of $10 billion, that is still less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s overall sales.\nMicrosoft products, in the main, are about utility \u2014 productivity tools, whether people use them at work or at home. And its Azure cloud technology is a service for businesses and a platform for software developers to build applications, a kind of cloud operating system.\nMr. Nadella\u2019s big acquisitions have been intended to add to its offerings for business users and developers. In 2016, Microsoftbought LinkedIn, the social network for professionals, for $26.2 billion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the coming together of the professional cloud and the professional network,\u201d Mr. Nadella explained at the time.\nThis year, Microsoftpaid $7.5 billion for GitHub, an open software platform used by 28 million programmers.\nUnder Mr. Nadella, Microsoft has loosened up. Windows would no longer be its center of gravity \u2014 or its anchor. Microsoft apps would run not only on Apple\u2019s Macintosh software but on other operating systems as well. Open source and free software, once anathema to Microsoft, was embraced as a vital tool of modern software development.\nMr. Nadella preached an outward-looking mind-set. \u201cWe need to be insatiable in our desire to learn from the outside and bring that learning into Microsoft,\u201d he wrote in his book \u201cHit Refresh,\u201d published last year.\nThe company\u2019s financial performance \u2014 and its stock price \u2014 suggest that the Nadella formula is working.\n\u201cThe old, Windows-centric view of the world stifled innovation,\u201d said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Sloan School of Management. \u201cThe company has changed culturally. Microsoft is an exciting place to work again.\u201d"
