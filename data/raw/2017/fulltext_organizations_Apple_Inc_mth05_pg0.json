        "title": "In the Stock Market, International Is Actually First",
        "fulltext": "In his first speech as president of the United States, Donald J. Trumpdeclared, \u201cFrom this day forward, it is going to be only America first, America first.\u201d\nIf you had taken his words at face value, you might have expected that big American companies that make nearly all of their money in the United States would flourish in a new, America First environment.\nBut that\u2019s not the way it has turned out, at least not in the stock market so far.\nShares of American companies that make nearly all of their sales domestically have lagged behind those that generate most of their revenue outside American borders. In fact, those globalized companies \u2014 I\u2019ll call them International First companies \u2014 have outperformed America First companies by a wide margin.\nPaul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, an independent market research firm, ran the numbers at my request. He found that 113 companies in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index make at least 50 percent of their sales outside the United States. Their fortunes depend, to a large extent, on the rest of the world\u2019s economic trends.\nIt\u2019s also relevant that many of these companies, like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Pfizer, General Electric and Exxon Mobil, have stashed billions of dollarsoverseas. They stand to receive a windfall under proposed Trump administrationtax policiesthat would allow them to repatriate that money at a very low rate, perhaps 10 percent, compared with the current statutory federal corporate tax rate of 35 percent. That potential bonanza, in itself, gives them a boost in the stock market.\nBy contrast, the America First category contains 161 S.&.P. 500 companies that make at least 90 percent of their sales within the United States. The group includes retailers like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Target, railroads like CSX and Norfolk Southern, and regional natural gas and petroleum companies like Southwestern Energy, Range Resources and Pioneer Natural. All of their fortunes are determined mainly by events and policies within the United States.\nWhile each stock has its own story, Mr. Hickey said he found a clear pattern in the overall data. From the presidential election on Nov. 8 through this past Tuesday, he said, shares in the International First group gained an average 13.56 percent, compared with only 8.15 percent for the America First shares, for a spread of 5.41 percentage points.\nThat\u2019s a substantial gap for a roughly six-month period. And it would be even larger if Mr. Hickey had used asset-weighted and not equal-weighted performance numbers in his calculations, because the International First group is salted with gigantic companies like Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft. Their enormous market capitalizations \u2014Apple\u2019sis more than $800 billion \u2014 have an outsize impact on asset-weighted indexes like the S.&.P. 500.\nWhy have the internationally oriented companies outperformed the domestically focused ones? Several factors explain the discrepancy.\nFirst, the initial wild enthusiasm in financial markets for Trump policies faded.\n\u201cThere was a lot of optimism by people in the markets about America First policies right after the election,\u201d Mr. Hickey said, \u201cbut in 2017 in actual terms, that has been completely flipped.\u201d\nSoon after the election, when the Trump rally in the overall stock market had the most momentum, the America First companies did outperform the International First group. The markets may then have been reacting to Mr. Trump\u2019s publicly stated views, which he summarized in his inaugural address this way: \u201cEvery decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our product, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.\u201d\nAmerican companies with little foreign exposure maintained an advantage in the stock market until mid-March, when the tables turned and the International First group pulled ahead.\nAs I wrote in March, it wasn\u2019t just the stock market that changed course: The shift started in the currency markets. The dollar, which had soared on Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise election victory, began to weaken against other currencies, particularly theMexican peso.\nMore precisely, measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar peaked in strength on Jan. 3 \u2014 with a 6.53 percent gain since the election \u2014 and then began to plummet. On Thursday, the dollar was still stronger than it had been on Election Day, but by less than 1 percent.\nSome of that decline may have been simple mean reversion, a tendency of markets to return to an average level after a big move. But there was more to it than that.\nWhile the Trump administration\u2019s effort to crack down on unauthorized immigrants has been real enough \u2014 Immigration and Customs Enforcementarrestsjumped by nearly 40 percent in Mr. Trump\u2019s first 100 days \u2014 the administrationhas not done muchto alterinternational tradepatterns.\nThat may still happen. On Thursday, itnotifiedCongress that it intends to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). But the parameters of that renegotiation have narrowed sharply, perhaps in response to substantial resistance to many of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies by companies that have prospered under Nafta. Jeffrey Immelt, the General Electric chief executive, for example, has urged the president to avoid protectionism, and said onMay 12in Mexico that his company is \u201cvery supportive\u201d of Nafta.\nWhat\u2019s more, Mr. Trump has moderated his position on China, reaching newtrade agreementsthat may increase, rather than hamper, bilateral trade. That could improve the prospects for globalized American companies.\nAnd Mr. Trump decided tosend a delegationto Beijing for China\u2019s economic conference on its new Silk Road plan, known as the Belt and Road initiative. That, too, could lead to more business for internationally minded American capitalists.\nThe International First companies have also been helped by signs of economic improvement inEuropeand strong performance in foreign stock markets, many of which have been outperforming the American stock market in both local currency and in dollar terms. In short, American companies with heavy exposure to foreign markets have gotten some international tailwinds.\nDomestic problems \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s political struggles, and Congress\u2019s inability to enact major legislation \u2014 may have led the stock market to ignore the Trump agenda. That helps globalized companies.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much about America First policies these days,\u201d Mr. Hickey said. \u201cBut it\u2019s becoming clear that even if you don\u2019t get thorough tax policy reform done or a big infrastructure stimulus program done, the stock market isn\u2019t falling apart. Instead, the stocks that are leading the market now are not America First plays, they are international plays \u2014 companies geared toward international exposure that benefit from a weaker dollar and better growth overseas.\u201d\nThen there is the tax question. Despite the political turmoil in Washington, tax cuts and a possible windfall for the International First companies remain on the table. The administration still aims at repatriating at least some of the $2 trillion in stranded overseas corporate cash and ending the taxation of newly minted corporate profits earned abroad. Market analysts are already calculating the potential benefits to companies with substantial foreign earnings and big cash hoards, like Apple.\nPut all of that together, and you get a recipe for a rally in International First companies. America First may be the administration\u2019s slogan, but for the most part, the stock market has been ignoring it."

        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Uber Under Scrutiny",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Ahoy, Farhad! This is the first week I\u2019ve been able to stop traveling and get some work done. It\u2019s a good feeling when I can get off airplanes and sit on my couch, type some words and end each day by watching reruns of \u201cThe Office.\u201d\nHow do you spend your downtime?\nFarhad:I spend a lot of time watching physics lectures on YouTube. For real. I weirdly love learning about physics. And I have this dream of, like, becoming a physicist just from YouTube videos. See, Mike, I\u2019m bettering myself.\nMike:Right, well, what goes up must come down. Let\u2019s get into the news.\nSo this week was chock-full o\u2019 news. On Monday, IAC/InterActiveCorpdecided to buy Angie\u2019s List, the reviews site for handymen and the like. I give that acquisition a B+. Or five stars. Or however we rate people, places and things these days. I can\u2019t even remember my Uber rating, much less how to score my plumber.\nFarhad:This was an interesting move. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the huge companies that rule the internet \u2014 the Googles and Facebooks of the world, which together account for20 percentof all money spent on advertising in the world. It\u2019s tough, in that environment, to cobble together a medium-size internet business. But IAC has done just that with dating services \u2014 it owns Match, Tinder, Plentyoffish and several others \u2014 and now it\u2019s doing so with home services sites, too. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll work in the end, but cornering specific high-value niches seems like a good plan.\nAlso, I\u2019m really upset that I missed the chance to found Farhad\u2019s List.\nMike:Over in Facebook Messenger land, you can nowplay little mini-gameswhile chatting with your friends. I like the idea of beating you in Space Invaders and sending you little chats telling you how \u201cowned\u201d you are.\nFarhad:There\u2019s no way you can beat me at Space Invaders, Mike. No way.\nMike:Mmm hmm.Apple made a bazillion dollars last quarteryet still managed to disappoint Wall Street expectations. Facebookmade a lot of money, too, but they have a big problem with people literally killing each other on live video on the network, so investors were slightly less jubilant than they would normally be.\nOh, and Wall Street burst into applause when Twitter didn\u2019t self-immolate on its quarterlyearnings call last week. Good for them.\nFarhad:That was a wonderful rundown of earnings. You should go work for CNBC. Please.\nMike:Yeah. It was actually kind of an embarrassing week for Facebook. WhatsApp suffered agiant outage, which forced people to express dismay on Twitter, of all places. Then Facebook decided to close down its Oculus VR studio and leave the content-making up to the universe of, well, VR content makers out there. I imagine therewas no traction whatsoeverfor Facebook to have to take that drastic step.\nFarhad:On the other hand, Mark Zuckerberg, their C.E.O., did announce that the company would be hiring 3,000 more staff members for its video flagging team, which I thought was a good move. It will probably give Facebook some more bandwidth to tackle the terrible stuff \u2014 of course, now there are thousands of people whose job it is to watch videos of people literally killing each other. What a world.\nMike:Right. Let\u2019s get to our ever-topical topic, Uber.\nThe company is having a rough week \u2014 which is a phrase I use so often I should look into securing the rights to it \u2014 and things aren\u2019t looking up. On Thursday, wereported that the Department of Justiceis investigating whether or not Uber broke the law by using its Greyball tool, a piece of software I uncovered back in March that essentially let Uber escape the hands of the law in cities they were not yet allowed to operate within.\nIn my legal opinion, this sounds \u201cvery bad.\u201d\nFarhad:Thanks, Perry Mason.\nMike:Moreover, Uber could also be forced tohalt all of its work on self-driving vehicle technology, depending on the decision of a rather amusing judge, who also happens to be a longtime technology litigation veteran. Do you recall the Oracle vs. Google trial? I slept through it, but I heard it was nuts.\nAnyway, this is all just bad, bad, bad. Is this Uber\u2019s second, dramatic act before it rises on the wings of success in the days ahead? It all reminds me of the narrative arc of a movie.\nFarhad:I think I\u2019m turning into an Uber bear. I don\u2019t mean a very awesome bear \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m getting pretty skeptical of the company\u2019s long-term prospects. Uber has sold itself to investors on the theory that in the long run, it will own a huge share of the multitrillion-dollar global transportation market. At the moment it doesn\u2019t make any money. It\u2019s spending vast sums to expand globally and on new tech, like self-driving. But the theory is that the market is so large that profits will come, one day. It\u2019s essentially the Amazon model for cars instead of retail.\nButas Timothy Lee points out in Vox, Uber faces a lot of disadvantages that other tech giants don\u2019t have. Its internal culture is screwed up, the boss admits he needs to grow up, drivers kind of hate it, and now it may lose the self-driving race to Google. If it starts to look as if Uber\u2019s long-term vision may not pan out, won\u2019t employees start to leave? Won\u2019t investors lose confidence? Is a sudden death spiral really out of the question?\nMike: Who knows? All I know is I am a big fan of bears. So, I guess we agree this time.\nTill next week?\nFarhad: See you!"

        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Bonjour, Farhad! I am particularly happy this morning because this weekend I am seeing \u201cAlien: Covenant.\u201d It\u2019s a film that combines nearly all of my passions: The vast expanse of space, the terror of murderous xenomorphs and the boyish good looks of Michael Fassbender.\nFarhad:Fun fact about me: Never seen an \u201cAlien\u201d movie.\nMike:Wow, crazy. Well, they do say in Silicon Valley, no one can hear you scream.\nO.K., let\u2019s talk tech news. Earlier this week in transportation drama, I wrote a piece on how Waymo and Lyft \u2014 two of Uber\u2019s largest competitors \u2014 are collaborating in some sort offuture self-driving car initiative. It will no doubt stoke all sorts of speculation that Waymo, the self-driving car arm spun out of Google, may one day decide to buy Lyft. Who knows if they actually produce anything from the partnership \u2014 which is still light on detail \u2014 but at the very least it\u2019s a big ding to Uber at a time the company is vulnerable to attack.\nFarhad:I know it\u2019s hard to love Uber, and also it\u2019s quite possible that Uber stole Google\u2019s self-driving tech (we\u2019ll find out asthe big lawsuit proceeds). But to me, Google\u2019s actions here also deserve scrutiny.\nLook at all the sides Google and its parent company, Alphabet, are playing in self-driving. Through Waymo, Alphabet is building its own self-driving tech. But through its venture capital firm, Alphabet is also a huge investor in Uber. And it is also suing Uber. Also, through Waze, its mapping app, Google is running a car-pooling service that could compete with Uber. And now Waymo is partnering with Uber\u2019s biggest competitor.\nIsn\u2019t this exactly the sort of thing people complain about when they say Google is getting too big and powerful? In every way imaginable, Google is trying to use its huge power to completely dominate the future of driving tech.\nMike:It reminds me of how you act around the office.\nAnyway, in non-Uber news, Wired dropped a huge story onApple\u2019s new campus, Apple Park, which basically looks like something out of aKubrickfilm. My favorite follow-up story, however, came from The Outline, which had asource send them a pizza box from the company. Apple patented a circular pizza box that keeps pizza crispy and well-ventilated as employees walk from Apple\u2019s cafeterias back to their desks.\nThis is exactly why Apple is the most valuable public company in the world.\nFarhad:I don\u2019t care how much rounded glass Apple\u2019s HQ has, it won\u2019t beat working from home.\nMike:Moving on, Instagramadded face filters to its app, continuing its streak of innovatively finding new ways to rip off Snapchat for its product road map. Bravo.\nFacebook had a series of embarrassing errors this week. After admitting it made its 10thmistake in advertising measurement, they had to pay back a bunch of the marketers who advertise through the platform. Nothing worse for a business than paying the people back who, um, are the ones paying you.\nShortly after that, Facebook also wasordered to pay a $122 million fine to the European Unionfor making misleading statements regarding user privacy back when the company bought WhatsApp, the messaging app, for an obscene amount of money. Ouch.\nSince our Federal Trade Commission seems relatively toothless in big tech acquisitions, methinks Facebook is going to face a lot of pain in the E.U. over the next few years. Keep an eye on that.\nFarhad:Not just Facebook, I imagine. As the world gets more and more worried about the size and power of Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft, foreign regulators might become the most powerful checks on the tech giants. It will be an interesting fight to watch.\nMike:I should note Google\u2019s slew of announcements at I/O, the company\u2019s annual conference for software developers. They basically do agigantic news dumpwhere they announce the latest in software updates, the status of Android, and the evolution of some of their latest initiatives like Google Home and Google Assistant.\nBut to be honest with you, the Google stuff reminds me of what I really wanted to talk about this week: I genuinely do not care about any of it.\nNothing against Google, mind you. It\u2019s just difficult for me to concentrate on the slow dribble of tech news when the United States seems to be going through what amounts tothe final season of \u201cLost\u201din front of our very eyes. I\u2019m hoping that \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 we wake up at the end and realize it was all a hallucination directly preceding our untimely deaths. Or maybe something less grim.\nFarhad:Oh, yes. I went to Google\u2019s opening keynote and I thought there was actually a bunch of cool stuff there. But half the time I was glued to my phone for news of an impending constitutional crisis. It\u2019s hard to muster much interest in easier photo sharing when your entire photo deck is full of screenshots of crazy headlines.\nMike:Just look at our front page on any given day. Or, heck, turn on literally any form of electronic communication around 6 p.m. each day and watch a shotgun blast of political news dumps drop.\nThis week was thecontinuing saga with former F.B.I. director James Comey, the investigation into Russia\u2019s possible collusion with Donald J. Trump in the 2016 election, and the latest on Michael Flynn, the disgraced National Security Advisor. And that was just Monday!\nHow do you stay passionate about tech news throughout this stuff? I find it difficult to do more than warm up microwave burritos every night for dinner and watch CNN for hours.\nFarhad:It\u2019s an interesting question \u2014 and as someone who\u2019s usually hooked to both politics news and tech news, I\u2019ve been feeling this tug. On the one hand really nothing in tech seems like it\u2019s that interesting at the moment. It\u2019s not just that national headlines are eating up all my brainspace; it\u2019s also that so much of what\u2019s interesting in tech, these days, is pretty speculative.\nSelf-driving cars are a good example. Everyone in tech seems pretty sure that self-driving cars will change society in big ways, when they come. But when will that happen? Uber, Waymo, Tesla and others are locked in this existential battle for the future of transportation, but the battle is sure to be long, slow and unpredictable.\nWe might have a sense of where self-driving tech is going next year, and a better sense the year after that, and an even better sense in five or 10 years. But at any given moment, a particular development in the industry is going to seem like pretty small ball, especially compared to the car crash of politics news.\nOne thing I\u2019ve found is that chatting with folks in tech can be pretty therapeutic. A lof techies are relentlessly optimistic. Even when the world is falling apart, they can see some better version of the future, and they\u2019re working to build it. We journalists can get pretty cynical about the world, but being around techies does give me some sense, sometimes, that things could get better. Maybe.\nMike:Maybe, but we still have to talk to each other every week.\nFarhad:Oh man, you\u2019re right. Maybe it doesn\u2019t get better after all."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple is seeding the next generation of American-made glass for its iPhones and iPads, and its investments may have the side benefit of helping the company win favor in Washington.\nAppleannounced Fridaythat it was giving $200 million to Corning, which makes the tough, scratch-resistant face for every iPhone and iPad, to support the glass maker\u2019s efforts to develop and build more sophisticated products at its factory in Harrodsburg, Ky.\nCorning has made the glass for every iPhone since the original 10 years ago. Apple\u2019s investment, the first from the technology giant\u2019s$1 billion fund to promote advanced manufacturing in the United States, will help Corning develop thinner, more versatile glass for iPhones as well as other product lines that Apple is exploring, such as screens for self-driving cars and augmented reality glasses.\nThe move goes beyond Apple\u2019s traditional practice of subsidizing suppliers, said Tim Bajarin, president of the technology consulting firm Creative Strategies.\n\u201cI would see this more as an Apple-Corning partnership to flesh out what other kinds of things you would use glass for,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are literally thinking about stuff you and I aren\u2019t thinking about yet.\u201d\nThe investment is also a good-will gesture toward Republicans, including President Trump, who has criticized Apple for building its iPhones in China, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky. Apple said it spent $50 billion last year with American suppliers, although it manufactures just one product line, the nearly obsolete Mac Pro, in the United States.\nLast month, Mr. Trumpsketched out a planto slash overall corporate tax rates and perhaps offer companies a special break for bringing back profits held overseas.\nApple has accumulated more cash than any other company in the United States \u2014$257 billion as of April 1\u2014 and virtually all of it is stashed untaxed in foreign bank accounts. Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has repeatedly complained that taxes in the United States are too high and has vowed not to bring the cash home until taxes are cut.\nUnderscoring the political implications of the Apple-Corning deal, Mr. McConnell joined executives from the two companies at the formal announcement at the 65-year-old plant on Friday afternoon.\n\u201cLike millions of people around the world, the last thing I look at at night and the first thing I look at in the morning is my iPhone,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cUnlike millions of people around the world, I think of Harrodsburg, Ky., and this amazing Gorilla Glass that you guys make here.\u201d\nMr. McConnell said there was a lot that Congress could do to help Corning and Apple be even more successful.\n\u201cWe are going to try, through comprehensive tax reform, to make both of these corporations be in a better position to compete with other companies in other countries,\u201d he said.\nJeff Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, said that when Apple\u2019s founder, Steven P. Jobs, showed a prototype of the first iPhone on stage in 2007, it had a hard plastic face. Mr. Jobs complained that it scratched too easily in his pocket and ordered Mr. Williams to replace it with scratch-proof, shatter-resistant glass by the time the phone went on sale six months later. Such glass did not exist except in the lab, but Corning scrambled to get it into production.\n\u201cIt all happened here in Harrodsburg, and Apple owes you a big thank you,\u201d Mr. Williams told the assembled workers."

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Apple\u2019s iPhone business is sailing squarely into the doldrums between new models.\nThe company said Tuesday that the number of iPhones sold globally fell 1 percent in the first calendar quarter, compared with the same period a year ago, although revenue rose to $52.9 billion as more customers bought the supersized, more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.\nApple\u2019snet income per sharerose more than 10 percent, as a result of cost-cutting, higher prices and the company\u2019s continuing program to buy back its stock.\nThe first two calendar quarters are often sluggish for Apple as customers await new versions of products. But unusual expectations for the 10th anniversary iPhones, due in September, may have worsened the slowdown.\n\u201cPeople are waiting to see what\u2019s going on with the new iPhone,\u201d said Ben Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. \u201cApple needs to make sure the next phone has that \u2018wow\u2019 factor.\u201d\nThat will be particularly important in China, the world\u2019s largest smartphone market, where revenue fell 14 percent in the three months that ended April 1. The continuing poor results there dragged down brisk sales elsewhere, Apple executives said.\n\u201cWe gained market share in almost every country that we track,\u201d Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said in an interview.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, focused on several bright spots during a call with investors. Services grew 18 percent to $7 billion, and Mr. Cook said that customers were paying for 165 million active subscription services from Apple and third parties.\n\u201cApple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cOur active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits.\u201d\nApple is awaiting the outcome of tax policy discussions in Washington. President Trump has proposed a major cut in the corporate tax rate and has suggested he would favor a reduction in taxes for money that American corporations hold abroad.\nThe company had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, and analysts estimated that about 90 percent of it was stashed overseas.\nA tax cut would be \u201cvery, very beneficial,\u201d Mr. Maestri said, but Mr. Trump\u2019s plan remains vague and has not yet been introduced as legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for us to speculate at this point in time what might happen,\u201d he said.\nApple\u2019s stock, which closed at a high of $147.51 on Tuesday, fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading once its results had been released.\nApple raised the amount of money it was willing to commit to stock buybacks by $50 billion, and Mr. Maestri said that it would continue to buy despite the record price. \u201cWe really believe there is a lot of value in our stock,\u201d he said.\nApple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., also raised its quarterly dividend by 10.5 percent to 63 cents a share.\nJan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, said investors, too, are awaiting new iPhones. \u201cWhat\u2019s baked in the share price is a massive upgrade cycle,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "Q.I saw somebody in a restaurant using a smartphone to magnify the tiny type on the menu. What app is that and can I get it for my new iPhone?\nA.The App Store has several programs that borrow the iPhone\u2019s camera and use it to display a magnified view of objects in front of the device, but the currentiOS 10 system softwarecomes with its own Magnifier function. This tool is part of Apple\u2019s suite ofAccessibility features.\nTouse the Magnifier on an iOS 10 device, open the Settings icon and select General. On the General settings screen, choose Accessibility and then Magnifier. On the next screen, tap the button to the On position. Press the Home button to return to the iPhone\u2019s main screen.\nNow, when you want to read the fine print on the page or need to get a close-up look at something, press the iPhone\u2019s Home button three times quickly. This triple-click action (also known as theAccessibility Shortcut) brings up the Magnifier and any other preconfigured functions geared toward users with impaired vision, hearing or motor skills.\nWhen you have the Magnifier open in a dark restaurant, tap the lightning bolt icon on the screen to turn on the iPhone\u2019s flash for a steady stream of bright light. Tap the Filters icon to change the color cast on the screen. You can zoom in by dragging the slider on the screen and tap the padlock icon to lock the camera\u2019s focus.\nIf you want to freeze the frame, tap the round camera shutter button. Once the frame is frozen, you can zoom to the part you want to see better. Press your finger on the screen and select Save Image if you want to keep a copy in your Camera Roll. Tap the shutter button to unfreeze the frame, and press the Home button to leave the Magnifier.\nThe iOS Accessibility settings have a Zoom feature for making things larger on the iPhone screen itself.

        "title": "Apple Comes to Washington",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Last month I spoke on a panel here, organized by the Historical Society of Washington, about how local authors like me use \u201cplace\u201d in our work. The building where the panel was held \u2014 the Carnegie Library, a gleaming Beaux-Arts structure gifted to the city a century ago by the industrialist Andrew Carnegie \u2014 has become the latest sign of Washington\u2019s gentrifying times: Applerecently released plansto convert the building, long a civic space, into a lavish retail store.\nThe city itself \u2014 like the Carnegie Library \u2014 is getting a brand-new operating system. In the latest update, residents are whiter, richer, more plugged in. What does that mean for the sense of place here?\nSince the Civil War, the city has been a mecca, a beacon for black people like me, looking for freedom and opportunity. After nearly two decades of nonstop investment and influx of new residents (demographers say the city\u2019s population is growing by 1,000 each month), we are trying to figure out who we are now. Black residents are still the city\u2019s largest ethnic group, but newcomers are changing the culture drastically.\nWhat now defines Washington for the nearly 700,000 people who call the city home outside the shadow of the monuments, the Capitol and the White House? Are we a stark-white, sterile, oddly cheery, computer retail experience?\nThe other day, as I walked out of my family\u2019s Victorian rowhouse in the Bloomingdale neighborhood, I encountered a horde of people standing outside. They were wedged between a huge Dumpster and the 1895 rowhouse next door, where my former neighbor Ms. Maxine used to live, which is now being converted into luxury condos. They were listening to a lecture by a middle-aged blond woman on how to invest.\nI began discreetly chatting with a member of the crowd, who was standing with his foot planted on my garden retaining wall, when one of the organizers, a smartly dressed black woman, walked up to me.\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are filming. Could you please walk around?\u201d\nI gave her the nastiest glare I could muster. \u201cI live here,\u201d I spat out.\nThe blond woman paused her presentation and put her a finger to her lips. \u201cShhhhhh,\u201d she said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a neighbor,\u201d the black woman said, and cupped a hand over her mouth, adding softly, \u201cangry.\u201d\n\u201cAngry\u201d is not the right word. More like disoriented. Thrown off balance. Recently, after a meeting downtown, I was walking near the old Washington Post headquarters, where I worked for years. The corner of 15th and L Streets in Northwest, an intersection I once knew well, had been reduced to rubble in preparation for yet another new development. I no longer knew right from left. I had to stop someone to ask for directions.\nThe novelist Marita Golden, my fellow panelist at the Carnegie Library, has a new book, \u201cThe Wide Circumference of Love,\u201d that has found the right metaphor for this disorientation: The mind of one of her characters is being consumed by Alzheimer\u2019s as Washington is undergoing its transformation. When he walks onto the street at the corner of 14th and U and sees new high-rise condos and white people, he can\u2019t tell whether his mind is playing tricks on him.\nLongtime white residents are also struggling to identify with the place. I have been running with a white friend, Lauryl, for more than a decade in a running club. She teaches high school English. She has had enough of recent changes in Washington, too, though she herself is a transplant from Los Angeles. She\u2019s moving to New Orleans. \u201cWhen I walk outside my house, these people don\u2019t speak,\u201d she says of the newcomers.\nIt\u2019s true. I have given up on trying to introduce pedestrians to my neighborhood\u2019s friendly ways. More than half of them, it seems, are tourists renting Airbnbs.\nChange, of course, is the most organic thing about cities. Renewal and growth are exciting \u2014 they are why so many of us, my family included, put up with the many indignities and inconveniences of city life, living so close to our fellow humans.\nBut change without respect for the past is pernicious. The stories about the lives here are the most precious resource we have. Those potential investors in front of my house are poorer for never having gotten the chance to meet Ms. Maxine, who grew up in that house, which her father bought with his wages as a Pullman porter. Or the previous owner of my house, Mrs. Alvarez, who raised eight children there, in addition to her rose bushes, which I still care for. Or all the other black women who raised their families, swept the sidewalk immaculate each day and served as the neighborhood watch.\nOne day, we all get replaced by the next shiny thing. The Carnegie Library building will soon offer the latest phones and laptops. But our stories will never be obsolete. That\u2019s what makes a city a place with a beating heart and not just a container for replaceable parts."

        "title": "Apple Announces $1 Billion Fund to Create U.S. Jobs in Manufacturing",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While on the campaign trail last year, Donald J. Trump lamented the loss of manufacturing jobs in the United States and set his sights on companies like Apple to help rectify the situation. \u201cI\u2019m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China,\u201dhe said.\nOn Wednesday, Apple appeared to meet President Trump halfway.\nWhile it did not announce a new manufacturing facility with thousands of manufacturing jobs, Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, said it planned to dedicate resources to American job creation with a $1 billion fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the United States. The company said it would announce the first investment from its new fund later this month.\nThe fund \u201ccan be the ripple in the pond,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said during aninterview with CNBCin which he announced the new fund. \u201cThose manufacturing jobs create more jobs around them because you have a service industry that builds up around them.\u201d\nIn introducing the fund, Apple joined a growing list of companies that have said in recent months that they will add, promote or keep jobs \u2014 many of them related to manufacturing \u2014 in the United States.\nA look at the companies that changed plans, announced new ones or stood their ground after catching the president\u2019s attention.\nCarrier, a furnace maker that had been excoriated by Mr. Trump for potentially outsourcing jobs to Mexico, decided tokeep 800 of 1,400 jobsin Indianapolis. SoftBank, a Japanese company that has invested in many businesses worldwide, told Mr. Trump it would use a $100 billion technology fund to create 50,000 American jobs. This week, Infosys, a tech outsourcing company based in India, said it wouldhire up to 10,000 American workers.\nSome critics have suggested the Trump administration is too focused on manufacturing, as opposed to more quickly cultivating service occupations \u2014 in the leisure and hospitality or health care industries, for instance.\nBut for the roughly two-thirds of Americans who lack a four-year college degree, manufacturing remains one of the few sectors that can deliver a middle-class income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the typical factory worker earns more than $26 an hour, compared with $14 an hour for the average hotel and food services employee.\nEven if more manufacturing jobs are created, however, there may be too few Americans with manufacturing skills to fill them. LinkedIn\u2019smost recent monthly reporton employment trends found there were not enough people with manufacturing skills in areas like New York City, Los Angeles and Denver, which lack the industrial bases found in cities like Cleveland and Detroit. Many high school graduates avoided going into the sector in recent decades as it shed jobs, creating a labor shortage as older workers retire.\nApple\u2019s focus with its new fund is on a slice of the industry known as advanced manufacturing. That is a catchall term, but typically it involves the production of high-value-added products in sectors like technology, aerospace, automobiles, sustainable energy and medical equipment. In some cases, that means making much smaller batches than mass-production-oriented assembly lines churn out, or using robotics and 3-D printing to create bespoke items.\nMr. Cook\u2019s announcement of the new fund came midway through his interview with Jim Cramer of CNBC, when he was asked what he was doing to create jobs. Mr. Cook answered that Apple gave back in job creation and that the company had asked itself, \u201cHow can we get more people to do advanced manufacturing in the United States?\u201d\nMr. Cook did not address whether the fund was influenced by Mr. Trump\u2019s policies and statements on manufacturing.\nAsked by Mr. Cramer about working with the president, Mr. Cook said there were always issues to agree on and disagree on with any administration in any country. But \u201cyou look to find common ground and try to influence the things you don\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nMr. Cook added that Apple would announce initiatives to support its current employees and add to their ranks, and to aid the software developers who make apps for Apple\u2019s phones, watches and computers.\nApple, whichreported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, had $257 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of April 1, so a $1 billion fund is relatively paltry for the company. Much of Apple\u2019s cash is held overseas, but Mr. Cook told CNBC that the money the company was using for the fund is \u201cU.S. money.\u201d\nAn Apple spokesman said he did not have anything to add beyond what Mr. Cook said during the interview.\nApple buttressed the announcement of the $1 billion fund with awebpagefocused on job creation late on Wednesday. On its site, Apple highlighted a 19-year track record of American job creation, including how the company had grown to 80,000 employees in the United States since 1998, from 5,000, in part thanks to its sprawling retail operation."
