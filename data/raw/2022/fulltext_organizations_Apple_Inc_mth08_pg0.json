        "title": "How the Find My App Became an Accidental Friendship Fixture",
        "fulltext": "In July, Shay Pierre opened Apple\u2019s location-sharing app Find My and noticed a friend at an unfamiliar apartment building in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\nMs. Pierre, 23, zoomed in to inspect the building, then texted her friend its address, along with a joking \u201cwhere are you?\u201d Her friend came clean. He had started dating somebody, and he was at her apartment. If Find My had not given it away, Ms. Pierre would not have known about the relationship until months later.\nHer friend later relabeled the apartment building in the app: \u201cNone of your business.\u201d\nAs location sharing through apps like Find My has proliferated in recent years, they have become a staple in some friendships \u2014 ostensibly for safety but with the side effect of complicating dynamics between friends.\nThe impact is particularly noticeable among Generation Z and millennials, the first generations to come of age with the possibility of knowing where their peers are at all times. It has changed how friends communicate with one another and blurred lines of privacy. Friends now, sometimes unwittingly yet obsessively, check one another\u2019s locations and bypass whole conversations \u2014 about where somebody is, what they are doing or how their days are going \u2014 when socializing. All of that information can be gleaned from Find My.\nAlthough Find My is not marketed as a social experience, sharing locations has become a test of sorts, much like being included on a close friends list on Instagram or on a private story on Snapchat can signal closer friendships.\nLocation sharing isn\u2019t new. In 2011, Apple released Find My Friends. In 2013, 7 percent of U.S. adults said they checked into locations on social media or shared their locations with friends, according to the Pew Research Center. This year, 69 percent of Gen Z and 77 percent of millennials said they activated location-sharing features at least sometimes, compared with 62 percent of U.S. adults in general,according to the Harris Poll.\nBut what can be startling \u2014 and harder to quantify \u2014 is how widely younger people share their location information. Some say that they track a dozen or more friends on the app, and that those friends track them back.\nThese features are not limited to just Find My. Dating, food delivery and ride-hailing apps often ask for access to location data. Facebook\u2019s Messenger, Snapchat\u2019s Snap Maps and third-party apps like the family-oriented Life360 \u2014 all available on iPhones and Android phones \u2014 offerreal-time location-sharing features.\nAnd location sharing isbuilt into some smartphones. Starting in 2015, Find My Friends came automatically installed in iPhones. In 2019, it and Apple\u2019s device-locating apps Find My iPhone and Find My Mac were rolled into the stand-alone Find My. Google Maps, which comes preinstalled in Android phones, has a similar location-sharing feature.\nAs with a check-in on Facebook or location tagging on Instagram and Twitter, users opt into location sharing on Find My. But unlike those features, Find My shares real-time location after users opt in, with the options to share for one hour, until the end of the day or indefinitely.\nWith Find My, \u201cyou aren\u2019t actively choosing to do something as you reach a certain location because you\u2019re constantly sharing your location,\u201d said Michael Saker, a senior lecturer in digital sociology at City, University of London. As a result, \u201cthere\u2019s an intimacy that\u2019s intertwined with that act,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s a verification of being friends.\u201d\nBut sharing locations can come withprivacy concerns, especially if users are not aware of or do not consent to whom they share their location with, and for how long, said Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. Even if users consent at first, expectations among friends can make it more difficult to opt out, she said.\n\u201cPeople do this sort of indefinite data sharing because it is normalized within their immediate family or friend group,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one has normalized pushing against that sharing.\u201d\nAsked for comment, a spokeswoman for Apple referred to a support page for Find My with instructions on how to start and stop sharing locations.\nFor Jade Calvin-Nau, 24, Find My helps her remain connected with friends. In college, the app was as much about safety as it was about socializing. She and her friends checked it to make sure everybody got home safe after a night out or to see whether they could meet up.\n\u201cEverybody knew where everybody was at all times,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no reason for anybody to be like, \u2018Where you at?\u2019 You could just check.\u201d\nAfter she graduated, Ms. Calvin-Nau\u2019s map on Find My opened up to a constellation of contact icons scattered across the country. She currently shares her location with 18 people. From her apartment in Binghamton, N.Y., she said she typically checked the app five times a day and played \u201ca fun little guessing game\u201d of where everybody was.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like social media,\u201d she said. \u201cYou clock in, you check it. I refresh it like I refresh Twitter.\u201d\nOlive Okoro, 19, uses Find My to fortify friendships. She shares her location with about a dozen friends she most trusts. Apple\u2019s texting service, iMessage, tells users when somebody starts and stops sharing locations with them, and vice versa.\nThe notification about starting is \u201ca privilege,\u201d Ms. Okoro said. The one about stopping, though, \u201cfeels like a stab,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually like, \u2018You hate my guts.\u2019\u201d\nThis summer, when Ms. Okoro fell out with two friends, her first act of digital severance was not to block their phone numbers or to unfollow them on social media, but to stop sharing her location. She didn\u2019t want them to know whether she was at home in Dallas or at school in College Station, Texas \u2014 or where she was at all.\n\u201cWhen that friendship is no longer there, I immediately take my location back,\u201d she said.\nThe fear of missing out, typically fostered by social media, can extend to Find My because location sharing reveals how and with whom people spend their time, said Amanda Lenhart, who studies how technology affects families at the technology research nonprofit Data & Society. That increased awareness \u201ccan be troubling and emotionally difficult,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf you can see where your friends are and what they\u2019re doing, you can also see when they\u2019re gathering and you\u2019re not there,\u201d Ms. Lenhart said. \u201cIt gives the window that social media has into the activities of people that we like, which can include them doing things without you.\u201d\nAs Adira Gresham, 21, and her friends left Chicago for college, they shared their locations with one another. Ms. Gresham now shares her location with about 20 people. She checks her app at least twice a day and is not ashamed to ask what her friends are doing at a location \u2014 and why they are there without her.\n\u201cThey used to be like: \u2018Please stop. That\u2019s a little weird,\u2019\u201d Ms. Gresham said. \u201cNow, they know it\u2019s not me being weird. It\u2019s really just a safety thing.\u201d Sometimes, she added, \u201cthey all joke and say that I\u2019m a stalker.\u201d\nBut Ms. Gresham has drawn some lines. Once, while her friends were arguing, one friend tried to persuade her to share the other friend\u2019s location so they could fight. She balked.\n\u201cI felt like that was insane. That was crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would be invasive of her privacy, because she shares her location with me, to go tell somebody else.\u201d\nKarine Irwin, 22, from El Paso, has had a rocky relationship with Find My. In 2019, she saw a former friend was at the home of somebody she was interested in. She drove there and wrote a note that said, \u201cGuess who saw you,\u201d then signed her name and left it at his front door. Soon after, Ms. Irwin, her former friend and their mutual friends fell out.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have found out if I wasn\u2019t using it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow, I see it as a blessing. But at the time, it definitely didn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d\nAside from that incident, Ms. Irwin said, she noticed other behavioral concerns caused by Find My as pandemic restrictions eased. When the five friends she shares her location with began appearing in places that weren\u2019t their homes, it made her anxious \u2014 not only about missing out but also about their safety. Her therapist recently suggested deleting Find My.\n\u201cShe thinks I have a little bit of an obsession,\u201d Ms. Irwin said. But, she added, she felt safe knowing where her friends were, and knowing her friends knew where she was.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would be able to delete it,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Pixar\u2019s Ousted Founder Returns With Apple and \u2018Luck\u2019",
        "fulltext": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 The most Pixar movie of the summer is not from Pixar. It\u2019s from Apple TV+ and the lightning-rod filmmaker-executive who turned Pixar into a superpower: John Lasseter.\nFive years ago, Mr. Lasseter wastoppled by allegationsabout his behavior in the workplace. Almost overnight, his many accomplishments \u2014 building Pixar from scratch, forging the megawatt \u201cToy Story\u201d and \u201cCars\u201d franchises, reviving a moribund Walt Disney Animation, delivering \u201cFrozen,\u201d winning Oscars \u2014 became a footnote.\nAfter employees complained aboutunwanted huggingby Mr. Lasseter, Disney investigated and found that some subordinates occasionally felt him to be a tyrant. He was forced to resign as Disney-Pixar\u2019s animation chief, apologizing for \u201cmissteps\u201d that made staff members feel \u201cdisrespected or uncomfortable.\u201d\nMr. Lasseter, 65, is now on the verge of professional redemption. His first animated feature since he left Disney-Pixar will arrive on Apple\u2019s subscription streaming service on Friday. Called \u201cLuck,\u201d the $140 million movie follows an unlucky young woman who discovers a secret world where magical creatures make good luck (the Department of Right Place, Right Time) and bad luck (a pet waste research and design lab dedicated to \u201ctracked it in the house\u201d). Things go terribly wrong, resulting in a comedic adventure involving an unusual dragon, bunnies in hazmat suits, leprechaun millennials and an overweight German unicorn in a too-tight tracksuit.\nApple, perhaps the only company that safeguards its brand more zealously than Disney, has been using Mr. Lasseter as a prominent part of its marketing campaign for \u201cLuck.\u201d Ads for the film, which Peggy Holmes directed and Mr. Lasseter produced, describe it as coming \u201cfrom the creative visionary behind TOY STORY and CARS.\u201d\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, shared a look at the film in March at the company\u2019s latestproduct showcase event. \u201cLuck\u201d is just the beginning of Apple\u2019s bet on Mr. Lasseter andSkydance Media, an independent studio that \u2014 contentiously \u2014 hired him in 2019 as animation chief. (Skydance hired lawyers to scrutinize the allegations against Mr. Lasseter and privately concluded there was nothing egregious.) Skydance has adeal to supplyApple TV+ with multiple animated films and at least one animated series by 2024.\nPariah? Not at Apple.\n\u201cIt feels like part of me has come home,\u201d Mr. Lasseter said in a phone interview, noting that Steve Jobs, Apple\u2019s co-founder, helped build Pixar before selling it to Disney in 2006. \u201cI really like what Apple TV+ is doing. It\u2019s about quality, not quantity. And their marketing is just spectacular. It\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever seen in all the movies I\u2019ve made.\u201d\nMr. Lasseter\u2019s return to full-length filmmaking comes at an awkward time for Disney-Pixar, which appears to be a little lost without him, having misfired badly in June with a \u201cToy Story\u201d prequel. \u201cLightyear,\u201d about Buzz Lightyear before he became a toy, seemed to forget what made the character so beloved. The movie, which cost an estimated $300 million to make and market worldwide, has taken in about $220 million, which is even worse than it sounds for Disney\u2019s bottom line because theaters keep at least 40 percent of ticket sales. \u201cLightyear\u201d is the second-worst-performing title in Pixar\u2019s history, ranking only above \u201cOnward,\u201d which came out in March 2020 at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\nMr. Lasseter declined to comment on \u201cLightyear,\u201d which arrives on Disney+ on Wednesday. He also declined to discuss his departure from Disney.\nMore than 50 people have followed Mr. Lasseter to Skydance from Disney and Pixar, including Ms. Holmes (\u201cSecret of the Wings\u201d), whom he hired to direct \u201cLuck.\u201d The screenplay for \u201cLuck\u201d is credited to Kiel Murray, whose Pixar and Disney writing credits include \u201cCars\u201d and \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon.\u201d Mr. Lasseter and Ms. Holmes hired at least five more Disney-Pixar veterans for senior \u201cLuck\u201d crew jobs, including the animation director Yuriko Senoo (\u201cTangled\u201d) and the production designer Fred Warter (\u201cA Bug\u2019s Life\u201d).\nJohn Ratzenberger, known as Pixar\u2019s \u201cgood luck charm\u201d because he has voiced so many characters over the decades, pops up in \u201cLuck\u201d as Rootie, the Land of Bad Luck\u2019s unofficial mayor.\nThe upshot: With its glistening animation, attention to detail, story twists and emotional ending, \u201cLuck\u201d has all the hallmarks of a Pixar release. (Reviews will arrive on Wednesday.) Some people who have seen the film have commented on similarities between \u201cLuck\u201d and the 2001 Pixar classic, \u201cMonsters, Inc.\u201d Both films involve elaborate secret worlds that are accidentally disrupted by humans.\n\u201cI want to take the audience to a world that is so interesting and beautiful and clever that people love being in it,\u201d Mr. Lasseter said. \u201cYou want the audience to want to book a week\u2019s vacation to the place where the movie just took place.\u201d\nIt remains true, however, that Mr. Lasseter continues to be a polarizing figure in Hollywood. Ashlyn Anstee, a director at Cartoon Network,told The Hollywood Reporterlast week that she was unhappy that Skydance was \u201cletting a so-called creative genius continue to take up positions and space in an industry that could begin to be filled with different people.\u201d\nEmma Thompson has not changed her public position on Mr. Lasseter since backing out of a role in \u201cLuck\u201d in 2019. She had been cast by the film\u2019s first director and quit when Mr. Lasseter joined Skydance.\n\u201cIt feels very odd to me that you and your company would consider hiring someone with Mr. Lasseter\u2019s pattern of misconduct,\u201d Ms. Thompsonwrote in a letterto David Ellison, Skydance\u2019s chief executive. (Her character, a human, no longer exists in the radically reworked film.)\nMs. Holmes, the \u201cLuck\u201d director, said she had no qualms about joining Mr. Lasseter at Skydance.\n\u201cIt has been a very, very positive experience, and John has been a great mentor,\u201d she said.\nHolly Edwards, the president of Skydance Animation, a division of Skydance Media, echoed Ms. Holmes. \u201cJohn has been incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that we\u2019re creating an environment where people know they have a voice and know they are being heard.\u201d Ms. Edwards previously spent nearly two decades at DreamWorks Animation.\nSome of Mr. Lasseter\u2019s creative tactics have not changed. One is a willingness to radically overhaul projects while they are on the assembly line \u2014 including removing a director, something that can cause hurt feelings and fan blowback. He believes that such decisions, while difficult, are sometimes crucial to a quality outcome.\n\u201cLuck,\u201d for instance, was already in the works when Mr. Lasseter arrived at Skydance. Alessandro Carloni (\u201cKung Fu Panda 3\u201d) had been hired to direct the film, which then involved a battle between human agents of good luck and bad luck.\n\u201cAs soon as I heard the concept, I actually was kind of jealous,\u201d Mr. Lasseter said. \u201cIt\u2019s a subject that every single person in the world has a relationship with, and that is very rare in a basic concept of a movie.\u201d\nBut he ultimately threw out almost everything and started over. The primary cast now includes Jane Fonda, who voices a pink dragon who can sniff out bad luck, and Whoopi Goldberg, who plays a droll leprechaun taskmaster. Flula Borg (\u201cPitch Perfect 2\u201d) voices the overweight, bipedal unicorn, who is a major scene stealer.\n\u201cSometimes you have to take a building down to its foundation and, frankly, in this case, down to its lot,\u201d Mr. Lasseter said.\nMr. Lasseter did not invent the concept of doing real-world research to inform animated stories and artwork, but he is known for pushing far beyond what is typically done. For \u201cLuck,\u201d he had researchers dig into what constitutes good luck and bad luck in myriad cultures; the filmmaking team also researched the foster care system, which informed part of the story. (The lead character grows up in foster care and is repeatedly passed over for adoption.)\nAs at Pixar and at Disney, Mr. Lasseter set up a \u201cstory trust\u201d council at Skydance in which a group of elite directors and writers candidly and repeatedly critique one another\u2019s work. The Skydance Animation version will soon include Brad Bird, a longtime Pixar force (\u201cThe Incredibles,\u201d \u201cRatatouille\u201d) who recently joined Mr. Lasseter\u2019s operation to develop an original animated film called \u201cRay Gunn.\u201d\nMs. Holmes said Mr. Lasseter was a nurturing creative force, not a tyrannical one.\n\u201cJohn will give you notes on sequences,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will suggest dialogue. He will comment on color or timing or effects. He\u2019ll pitch story ideas. He\u2019ll draw something \u2014 \u2018Oh, maybe it could look like this.\u2019\n\u201cAnd then it\u2019s up to you and your team to execute against those notes. Or not. Sometimes we came back to John and said the note didn\u2019t work \u2014 and this is why \u2014 or we decided we didn\u2019t need to address it.\u201d\nMs. Holmes added: \u201cWhen the answer is no, he\u2019s really OK with it.He\u2019sreally OK with it.\u201d"

        "title": "Clock Running Out on Antitrust Bill Targeting Big Tech",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Critics of the country\u2019s largest tech companiesbrandedthe last few months \u201cHot Antitrust Summer\u201d because they hoped that Congress would vote on new regulations for Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook.\nThe legislation\u2019s chances of passing before Labor Day melted away instead. The Senate is expected to take up one last major matter of business before its August recess, debating and voting on the Democrats\u2019 large climate, tax and health care package.\nThe failure to secure a vote is a setback for the politicians, activists and regulators who believe that Big Tech has too much control over commerce, communications and culture. After Labor Day, Washington will turn much of its attention to the midterm elections instead of major legislation. And if Republicans regain the majority in Congress, the regulations have a far smaller chance of being taken up.\n\u201cOne of the senators actually said to me, \u2018Maybe you\u2019re just ahead of your time,\u2019\u201d Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the main driver of the legislation, said in an interview. \u201cAnd I said to them, \u2018Yeah, but being ahead of your time doesn\u2019t mean that your time hasn\u2019t come.\u2019 And at some moment your time comes.\u201d\nSupporters of Ms. Klobuchar\u2019s bill, called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, argue that a national update to antitrust law would allow smaller businesses to thrive by reining in big tech companies. The bill would bar the companies from prioritizing their own services over those of their rivals. So Amazon, for example, could not show its own Amazon Basics batteries before those made by Duracell, and Google might have to put its own restaurant reviews on par with sites like Yelp in search results.\nThe bill\u2019s backers cheered in May when Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, said privately that he would put it up for a vote early in the summer. It was approved by the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support, and Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, her primary Republican co-sponsor, said they had the votes for the legislation to succeed if the full Senate voted on it.\nThe tech companies poured tens of millions of dollars into lobbying against the bill. Groups funded by the companies put ads on the air in swing states, saying the legislation was ill-advised at a time of rampant inflation. The chief executives of Google, Apple and Amazon all personally lobbied against the bill.\nThe industry also argued that there could be unintended consequences for speech online, as the bill could be interpreted as also limiting how much these companies can moderate content, including hateful posts. The bill\u2019s supporters say their concerns are unfounded, butfour Democratic senators in June called for amending the bill to ensure it was not misinterpreted.\nSupporters of the bill have tried to continue putting pressure on Mr. Schumer to bring it up for a vote, highlighting work his children have done for the big tech companies.\nThey argued that if lawmakers had to vote on the bill, it would pass. But last month at a fund-raiser, Mr. Schumer said he didn\u2019t believe the measure had the 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. And he said he would not put it on the floor until he had a better sense that it could pass, said a person with knowledge of his comments, who would speak only anonymously because the discussion was private. Mr. Schumer\u2019s commentswere first reportedby Bloomberg.\n\u201cAll I can tell you is that Klobuchar was very disappointed when she was led to believe it was going to be brought up in this time frame and it\u2019s not brought up, and we don\u2019t have a lot of time between now and the election,\u201d Mr. Grassley said in an interview.\nOther priorities in the Senate like theclimate, energy and tax packagebrokered between Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Mr. Schumer have also brushed antitrust matters aside. Before the surprise reconciliation deal on that bill, slow work on aveteran health care bill, asweeping gun control measureand achip manufacturing billdominated the legislative calendar.\nSome of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors said the bill was a low priority for them as they prepared to leave Capitol Hill for the month. Senator Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, said she was focusing on legislation that was being discussed before the August recess.\nMs. Klobuchar said that she had spoken with Mr. Schumer and discussed putting the bill up for a vote in the fall.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s committed to working on this and getting this through,\u201d she said. There is also a similar proposal in the House of Representatives that has bipartisan support.\nA spokesman for Mr. Schumer said in a statement that the majority leader was \u201cworking with Senator Klobuchar and other supporters to gather the needed votes and plans to bring it up for a vote.\u201d\nSarah Miller, the executive director of the liberal American Economic Liberties Project, said that should the efforts to pass a new antitrust law in Washington fizzle, it would only make the role of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, whichsued to block Meta\u2019s acquisitionof a virtual reality company last month, and state lawmakers more important in reining in Big Tech.\n\u201cFortunately there\u2019s not only one sheriff in town,\u201d she said, \u201calthough I think Congress\u2019s ability to directly promote fairness and competition in digital markets will continue to be an essential project.\u201d"

        "title": "Change These Default Settings and Be Happier With Your Tech",
        "fulltext": "Many default settings buried deep inside our technology make us share superfluous amounts of data with tech companies. In mylast column, I went over how to shut those off.\nBut not all default settings do sneaky things with our information. There are also some that need to be activated or disabled to make our devices more enjoyable to use.\nNewer iPhones, for one, come with a fancy camera that can shoot extremely clear videos in ultrahigh\u201c4K\u201d resolution\u2014 but most people probably aren\u2019t using their cameras to their full potential because, by default, the phone is set to shoot videos at a lower resolution.\nTVs are another example. Many modern televisions come with an effect known as motion smoothing turned on to make videos look as if they are playing at a higher frame rate, which is supposed to make fast-motion scenes look more detailed. But in many applications, especially when you\u2019re watching movies, it creates a soap-opera effect that many find looks fake. It\u2019s the setting on a TV that manytech-inclined people switch off immediately.\nOur consumer electronics are among our most expensive household purchases, so it\u2019s worthwhile to peruse and change the default settings to reap their maximum benefits. Here\u2019s what I and other tech writers always change to make our phones, computers and televisions work better.\nApple\u2019s iPhones include various settings that are turned off by default and must be activated to make the device more convenient to use and to take better photos.\nUnlock an iPhone while wearing a mask.Though mask mandates have been lifted in many places, plenty of people still wear them to feel safe, especially indoors. One of the biggest drags to using an iPhone was having to punch in a passcode, rather than use facial identification, when wearing a mask. Recent versions of Apple\u2019s iOS now let iPhone users unlock the device without removing their mask. Go toSettings \u2192 Face ID & Passcode \u2192 Face ID with a Maskand toggle this setting on (green).\nShoot 4K video.To make an iPhone camera shoot video at its highest resolution, go toSettings \u2192 Camera \u2192 Record Videoand choose a 4K option.(I prefer \u201c4K at 30 fps\u201d because it works well when uploading videos to social media apps and internet sites like YouTube.)The downside is that 4K recordings will clog more of the phone\u2019s digital storage. But if you paid for that fancy camera, why not put it to use?\u200c\nActivate the camera grid.In digital photography, photographers use various composition techniques to make photos more aesthetically pleasing. The iPhone camera has a setting to show a grid to help compose shots. Go toSettings \u2192 Camera \u2192 Gridand toggle this setting on.\nAndroid phones also include controls that have to be activated or modified to make the screen look better and the phone easier to use.\nChange the display\u2019s color profile.Many Android phones come with big, bright screens, but their colors may look oversaturated or too blue. Ryne Hager, an editor at the tech blog Android Police, said he typically switched out the default color profile whenever he set up a new Android phone. Instructions vary from phone to phone. For Samsung phones, go toSettings \u2192 Display \u2192 Screen mode\u2192Natural. For Pixel phones, go toSettings \u2192 Display \u2192 Colors \u2192 Natural.\nModify the shortcuts.On Android phones, you can customize the \u201cquick settings\u201d menu for shortcuts to features that you use often. Swipe down from the top of the smartphone screen, and swipe down again. If you tap the icon that looks like a pencil, you can choose to add tiles that let you, for example, activate hotspotting to share the phone\u2019s cellular connection with a computer.\nActivate the camera grid.Similar to iPhones, some Android phones can also show a grid to make photo composition easier. On Pixel phones, open the camera app, swipe down from the top of the screen, tap the gear icon and then go toGrid type \u2192 3x3.\nOn Macs, where Apple users tend to do work, it\u2019s useful to adjust settings to eliminate distractions and make tasks quicker. That involves switching off some features that were on by default and turning on some hidden features.\nActivate a shortcut to show the desktop.Shrinking and moving around windows just to find a file on the desktop can be tedious. The first thing I do with any Mac is activate a shortcut that immediately hides all windows to show the desktop. Go toSystem Preferences \u2192 Mission Control \u2192 Show Desktopand choose a keyboard key to trigger the shortcut. (I use the fn key on my MacBook keyboard.)\nTurn off notifications for distracting apps like Messages.In an era of never-ending video calls, you definitely don\u2019t want text messages bombarding your screen and making sounds when you\u2019re in a meeting. Just switch those notifications off permanently. Go toSystem Preferences \u2192 Notifications & Focus \u2192 Messages \u2192 Allow Notificationsand toggle the setting to off (gray). In this menu, turn off notifications for any other noisy apps.\nAdd the Bluetooth icon to the menu bar.Most of us use Bluetooth accessories like wireless earphones and mice, so to make it easier to connect and disconnect these devices on a Mac, it helps to have quick access to the Bluetooth menu. Go toSystem Preferences \u2192 Bluetooth \u2192 Show Bluetooth in menu barand check the box. This will show the Bluetooth icon in the upper-right portion of the screen, where you can quickly connect and disconnect earbuds and other wireless accessories.\nLike Macs, Windows computers, by default, blast us with lots of notifications, but most frustrating are the many bleeps and bloops that go off when something goes wrong. Kimber Streams, a Wirecutter editor who tests laptops, shuts all these annoyances off.\nTurn off notifications.Go toSettings \u2192 System \u2192 Notifications. Uncheck all the boxes and toggle off all the switches to disable all notifications.\nTurn off system sounds.Go toSettings \u2192 System \u2192 Sound \u2192 More Sound Settings \u2192 Sounds \u2192 Sound Scheme: No sounds, and then hitApply.\nVirtually every TV comes with default settings that are far from ideal for showing the best picture.\nWith any TV, it\u2019s worthwhile toadjust colors, brightness and contrastto suit your space. There\u2019s no universal set of steps because the best settings will differ for every TV and living room. But there are helpful TV calibration tools to make this simple, including my go-to tool,Disney\u2019s World of Wonder, a Blu-ray Disc with instructional videos on adjusting your TV settings.\nBy far the most important step on any TV, though, is to turn off the hideous motion smoothing effect. Steps vary across TVs, so do a web search on disabling it for your model. On my LG TV, I went toAll Settings \u2192 Pictures \u2192 Picture Mode Settings \u2192 Picture Options \u2192 TruMotion \u2192 Off.\nGood riddance."

        "fulltext": "A traveler who put a tracking device in her bag helped sheriff\u2019s deputies in Florida identify an airport worker who was accused of stealing more than $16,000 in goods from passengers\u2019 luggage, the authorities said.\nGiovanni De Luca, 19, a baggage handler at Destin-Fort Walton Beach Airport, was arrested on Aug. 10 and charged with two felony counts of grand theft, the Okaloosa County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. The sheriff\u2019s office said Mr. De Luca, who worked for a subcontractor at the airport, had stolen from two passengers.\nOn July 14, the first passenger flew on a Delta/Air France flight into Destin-Fort Walton Beach, but her luggage never arrived, according to an arrest report. Her bag contained clothes, makeup and other items worth $1,648, according to the arrest report.\nThe bag also included an Apple AirTag, a Bluetooth-enabled tracking device that sends its location to its user to help them locate lost items. Placingsuch tracking devicesin luggage has become an attractive option for many travelers this summer as airport chaos has led tomore lost or delayed baggage.\nThe passenger told investigators that she received a notification on July 31, two weeks after she landed, that the device had been active on a street in Mary Esther, a town near the airport in the Florida Panhandle. Deputies looked through the addresses of airport employees and found that Mr. De Luca lived on the street, according to the arrest report.\nDays later, on Aug. 4, an employee for a Delta Air Lines subcontractor filed a report with the sheriff\u2019s office that he saw Mr. De Luca go through another passenger\u2019s checked bag at the outgoing baggage carousel, according to the arrest report.\nMr. De Luca was again working on Aug. 9 when a man flying from Destin-Fort Walton Beach reported to the sheriff\u2019s office that $15,000 in jewelry and sunglasses had been stolen from his luggage, according to the arrest report.\nThe next day, sheriff\u2019s deputies confronted Mr. De Luca at his home, where they recovered the missing jewelry and sunglasses, and arrested him, the sheriff\u2019s office said. He also admitted to going through the woman\u2019s missing bag from July 14 and destroying the AirTag when he found it, but her items were not recovered, the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nHe was booked in Okaloosa County on Aug. 10 and released the next day, according to jail records. Mr. De Luca could not be reached for comment, and it was unclear if he had a lawyer.\nA Delta spokesperson said in a statement that the airline was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d in the investigation.\n\u201cDelta has zero tolerance for this alleged conduct by anyone associated with Delta, including those who work for contractors,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nWhile AirTags and other tracking devices have been used tothwart theft, privacy groups have alsosounded alarms about their use to abet stalkingor tracking people without their knowledge.Apple said in Februarythat it would make changes to make it more difficult for people to use AirTags to track people without their knowledge, though critics said the steps did not go far enough."
