        "title": "Apple Rethinks Its Movie Strategy After a String of Misses",
        "fulltext": "When Apple won a bidding war in 2021 for the rights to make the action comedy \u201cWolfs\u201d with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, it did so in part because it promised the stars it would put the movie into a large number of movie theaters.\n\u201cBrad and I made the deal to do that movie where we gave money back to make sure that we had a theatrical release,\u201d Mr. Clooney said last yearin an interviewwith the Hollywood trade publication Deadline.\nBut this month, just six weeks before the film was set to show up in thousands of theaters around the United States, Apple announced a significant change in plans. \u201cWolfs\u201d will now be shown on a limited number of movie screens for one week before becoming available on the company\u2019s streaming service on Sept. 27. (Internationally, it won\u2019t appear in theaters at all with the exception of the Venice Film Festival, where it will premiere on Sept. 1.)\n\u201c\u2018Wolfs\u2019 is the kind of big event movie that makes Apple TV+ such an exceptional home for the best in entertainment,\u201d Matt Dentler, the head of features for Apple Original Films, said in a statement. \u201cReleasing the movie to theaters before making it widely available to Apple TV+ customers brings the best of both worlds to audiences.\u201d\nThe film\u2019s director, Jon Watts,told Vanity Fairthat he had found out about the change in plans only days before the announcement. \u201cThe theatrical experience has really made an impression on me, of how valuable this thing is and how important it is,\u201d Mr. Watts said. \u201cI always thought of this as a theatrical movie. We made it to be seen in theaters, and I think that\u2019s the best way to see it.\u201d\nDespite the filmmakers\u2019 desires, the about-face follows a middling run at the box office for Apple, whichbegan releasing films into theatersaround the country via partnerships with traditional studios in October.\nIt joined forces with Paramount Pictures to release Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon,\u201d which cost $200 million to make and grossed $157 million worldwide. Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d (Sony) cost $200 million and grossed $221 million worldwide. The $200 million spy thriller \u201cArgylle\u201d (Universal) grossed $96 million. And most recently, Apple teamed up with Sony again to release \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d which cost $100 million but grossed just $40 million worldwide despite the star power of Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum.\nApple\u2019s deal with Sony has it splitting marketing and distribution costs. Once those costs are recouped, the studio receives a distribution fee. Theater owners keep roughly 50 percent of the gross.\n\u201cNone of Apple\u2019s films have done well,\u201d Stephen Galloway, the dean of Dodge College of Film and Media Arts, said in an interview. \u201cFinancially, you might think it doesn\u2019t matter. This is a company worth $3.3 trillion. But psychologically, it does.\n\u201cApple\u2019s brand is quality, cutting-edge, sleek, refined, forward-looking, and so now you\u2019re tarnishing that brand with what seems like an old-fashioned, not-relevant, not-part-of-the-zeitgeist slate.\u201d\nApple, which declined to comment for this article, is not alone in its box office struggles. This year has seen some really big hits (\u201cInside Out 2,\u201d \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d) and some notable misfires (\u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d). And Apple has seen some of its films perform well in streaming.\nThis month, it released \u201cThe Instigators,\u201d with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, on Apple TV+ after one week of a limited theatrical release. The film helped the streaming service add about 50,000 subscribers, more than the number \u201cNapoleon\u201d accounted for when it was released last year, according to the data firm Parrot Analytics. Another data firm, Luminate, reported that \u201cThe Instigators,\u201d which was directed by Doug Liman, was the most-watched streaming film across all platforms during its first week of release.\nApple does not publicly disclose subscriber or viewing numbers.\nApple\u2019s entertainment programming is overseen by Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, who both had decades of experience running Sony Television beforejoining the company in 2017. The film business is run by Mr. Dentler, a former programmer at the SXSW Film Festival who joined Apple in 2012.\nRicky Strauss, Disney\u2019s former president of marketing, was hired last year to oversee creative marketing and strategy, but he reported to executives at company headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., while Mr. Dentler reported to Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht in Los Angeles. Mr. Strauss left after 16 months and hasn\u2019t been replaced.\nThe leadership team does hold the title of the first streaming service to win the best picture Oscar, which it did in 2022 with \u201cCODA.\u201d But its recent theatrical performance is not dissimilar from the bumps that Amazon Studios endured soon after Jennifer Salke, a veteran NBC executive,took over in 2018.\nSoon after taking the reins, Ms. Salke spent close to $50 million at the Sundance Film Festival for the rights to a handful of movies. Once the first film \u2014 \u201cLate Night,\u201d starring Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling \u2014 bombed at the box office, Ms. Salke quickly shifted her strategy. Future films went straight to streaming, which limited the financial risk and the public ridicule that often accompanies box office disappointments.\nMs. Salke has since hired Sue Kroll and Courtenay Valenti, two veteran executives from Warner Bros., to help improve her movie fortunes, both at the box office and for streaming films. Amazon now intends to more than double the number of movies it releases theatrically by 2027.\nWith \u201cWolfs,\u201d Apple substantially outbid its competitors, according to three people with knowledge of the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss financial terms, paying Mr. Clooney and Mr. Pitt more than $35 million each and Mr. Watts (\u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d) more than $15 million.\nSony Pictures, which had agreed to distribute the film and split the marketing costs with Apple, was set to begin a national marketing campaign during the Paris Olympics, only for Mr. Van Amburg to cancel it at the last minute, according to three people familiar with the marketing plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal matter.\nApple executives in Cupertino were already questioning the entertainment units over the amount of money being spent on movies, and the people said there was a thought within the company to not risk a public disappointment should the movie not succeed at the box office.\nCAA, the agency that represents Mr. Clooney, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Watts, did not fight the last-minute move, since the lack of promotion could have led to a theatrical underperformance affecting its clients\u2019 reputations, the people said.\nA spokesperson for CAA declined to comment.\nBoth competitors and those who work for Apple are rooting for the company\u2019s success. With the overall box office down 15 percent from last year, Paramountlaying off 15 percentof its employees before its pending merger and Warner Bros. Discovery struggling with its enormous debt load, Hollywood would love for Apple to keep spending money on movies. It seems likely to be disappointed.\nThis spring, top executives held a meeting at company headquarters. The result was a new edict, according to two people familiar with the details, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an internal gathering. Apple\u2019s studio would make one or two event-size films a year, with big budgets and expansive theatrical releases. The rest of its films would have budgets of $80 million or less, the people said.\nApple is still planning a big theatrical release next July for its movie \u201cF1,\u201d from the director Joseph Kosinski (\u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d), in partnership with Warner Bros.\nMr. Pitt is playing the leading role."

        "title": "Coming to \u2018iPhone City\u2019: An Electric Car Factory From Foxconn",
        "fulltext": "The core of Foxconn\u2019s business is in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province in central China, known as \u201ciPhone City.\u201d That\u2019s where a network of suppliers, infrastructure and factories, and sometimes as many as 250,000 Foxconn employees, manufacture most of the world\u2019s iPhones for Apple.\nNow Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, isplanningto build a new, 700-acre campus in Zhengzhou to make electric cars.\nThe question is, who will be the customers?\nIn February, Apple canceled its long standing project to develop electric carsafter plowing more than $10 billioninto it. Many of its rivals in China have charged ahead.\nFor Foxconn, the investment in Zhengzhou is part of a broader push to reduce its dependence on Apple. Sales of iPhones in China haveslumped, and Apple and other American device makers haveshifted some manufacturingto other countries.\nFoxconn plans to make cars designed and sold by other companies, the way it has made iPhones for Apple. So far it has won orders from Luxgen, a subsidiary of a Taiwanese automaker it has partnered with to make a limited number of buses and cars.\n\u201cThey need a breakthrough, which means finding a major customer,\u201d said Kirk Yang, the chairman of private equity firm Kirkland Capital.\nFoxconn has set out to become a major player in a crowded field.\nOver 130 companies sold electric vehicles in China last year, said Stephen Dyer, head of Asia Automotive at AlixPartners. The firm expects fewer than 20 of them will be profitable by the end of the decade.\nThe United States and the European Union have set steeptariffsto keep Chinese electric cars out. The intense competition has sparked a price war that has pushed even Tesla, the American company that is a leading manufacturer and seller of E.V.s in China, to discount.\nAnd in China, the line between smartphone makers and car companies has increasingly blurred. Huawei and Xiaomi, two of the companies that have eclipsed Apple among the country\u2019s best selling smartphone brands, already sell electric cars. Days after Foxconn announced its investment in the Zhengzhou electric vehicle facility, Xiaomi broke ground on its second.\nFoxconn executives say that the factors that enabled the company to make iPhones faster and at a lower cost than its competitors will translate to success in the auto industry.\nThat includes the manufacturing power and government support the company has built up in Zhengzhou. Perks like roads, power plants and tax breaksplayed a central rolein Foxconn\u2019s success as an Apple supplier. When a Covid-19 outbreak threatened output ahead of the 2022 holiday shopping season,local officials pitched into keep the iPhones moving off the factory floor.\nBut analysts question whether manufacturing power will be enough to help Foxconn stand out in China\u2019s crowded market.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s leading Chinese E.V. players to win in the market is not necessarily manufacturing, it\u2019s more about the software and technology that they are offering to consumers,\u201d said Mr. Dyer, who was previously an executive at Ford Motor in Shanghai.\nAnd when it comes to cars, reliability and safety matter to customers as much as low prices. \u201cIf a consumer electronic device crashes, it crashes,\u201d said Mr. Yang. \u201cBut a car malfunction can be fatal.\u201d\nFoxconn has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in E.V.-related manufacturing in Southeast Asia. It plans to make batteries and car parts in Thailand and Vietnam and microchips for cars in Malaysia. It has plans to be involved in a multibillion-dollar battery project in Indonesia, along with a number of other companies including a state-owned coal firm. The company is also in negotiations with two Japanese carmakers to make their vehicles.\nAt an old General Motors plant in Ohio that it bought fromLordstown Motors, which filed for bankruptcy last year, Foxconn makes a small number of electric buses.\nAt home in Taiwan in 2021, Foxconn set up a joint venture with the Taiwanese carmaker Yulon Motor to make luxury sedans, sport utility vehicles and buses under the name Foxtron. On Wednesday, Foxconn said it had delivered 5,400 cars for Yulon this year.\nFoxconn\u2019s limited output to date is not near the scale it would take to compete with China\u2019s top electric car makers.\n\u201cYou can hand build those at that volume,\u201d said Tu Le, a managing director of the consultancy Sino Auto Insights."

        "title": "Telegram Founder\u2019s Indictment Thrusts Encryption Into the Spotlight",
        "fulltext": "When French prosecutors chargedPavel Durov, the chief executive of the messaging app Telegram, with alitany of criminal offenseson Wednesday, one accusation stood out to Silicon Valley companies.\nTelegram, French authorities said ina statement, had provided cryptology services aimed at ensuring confidentiality without a license.\nIn other words, thetopic of encryptionwas being thrust into the spotlight.\nThe cryptology charge raised eyebrows at U.S. tech companies including Signal, Apple and Meta\u2019s WhatsApp, according to three people with knowledge of the companies. These companies provide end-to-end encrypted messaging services and often stand together when governments challenge their use of the technology, which keeps online conversations between users private and secure from outsiders.\nBut while Telegram is also often described as an encrypted messaging app, it tackles encryption differently than WhatsApp, Signal and others. So if Mr. Durov\u2019s indictment turned Telegram into a public exemplar of the technology, some Silicon Valley companies believe that could damage the credibility of encrypted messaging apps writ large, according to the people, putting them in a tricky position of whether to rally around their rival.\n\u201cIf we assume this becomes a fight about encryption, it is kind of bad to have a defendant who looks irresponsible,\u201d said Daphne Keller, who directs the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford\u2019s Cyber Policy Center.\nEncryption has been a long-running point of friction between governments and tech companies around the world. For years, tech companies have argued that encrypted messaging is crucial to maintain people\u2019s digital privacy, while law enforcement and governments have said that the technology enables illicit behaviors byhiding illegal activity.\nThe debate has grown more heated as encrypted messaging apps have become mainstream.Signalhas grown by tens of millions of users since its founding in 2018. Apple\u2019s iMessage is installed on the hundreds of millions of iPhones that the company sells each year. WhatsApp is used by more than two billion people globally.\nThese apps are encrypted by default, which means that users\u2019 conversations are immediately private the moment they start chatting. They also have end-to-end encryption, which scrambles messages in such a way that they can be deciphered only by the sender and the intended recipient.\nIn the past, Mr. Durov has championed Telegram\u2019s security as above that of its peers. He called the app\u2019s \u201csecret chat\u201d feature \u201cthe only popular method of communication that is verifiably private\u201d in apostto his personal Telegram channel in May.\nBut unlike WhatsApp, Signal and Apple\u2019s iMessage, Telegram requires users to manually opt into encryption through a hard-to-find setting within the app. That setting is offered only in one-to-one conversations on Telegram, even as many people use the service to join groups that can include hundreds of thousands of people.\nThe quality of Telegram\u2019s encryption has also been debated by security experts. Signal has made its software code viewable to the public, so that anyone can check the encryption for vulnerabilities. Telegram does not offer the same transparency and it is unclear how strong its encryption is.\n\u201cA lot of Telegram\u2019s users thought the landlord didn\u2019t have a key to their apartment,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, a security researcher at Citizen Lab, a cybersecurity watchdog at the University of Toronto. \u201cThey\u2019re now discovering that the company actually has keys for four out of five of their rooms.\u201d\nThat has frustrated U.S. tech executives, who said that Mr. Durov had played into the public\u2019s lack of understanding of encryption to bolster Telegram\u2019s image as a secure place to communicate.\nApple, WhatsApp and Signal declined to comment on Mr. Durov and Telegram.\nApple, WhatsApp and Signal have regularly gone to court or fought high-profile battles with governments to protect encryption. Last year, WhatsAppthreatened to pull out of Britainif lawmakers approved a measure ordering it to remove encryption from its app. Meredith Whittaker, the president of Signal, also said last year that the company would\u201cabsolutely 100 percent walk\u201daway from providing the service in Britain if it were forced to weaken the app\u2019s security.\nAnd in 2020, Applepushed backagainst an F.B.I. request that the company break its encryption in order to access data on two iPhones that belonged to a gunman who opened fire at a naval base in Florida.\nThe European Union has been debating a new law that would require messaging services to scan for photos and links to detect possible child sexual abuse material, which has raised alarms among encryption supporters.\nSilicon Valley executives are now watching Mr. Durov\u2019s case closely for the French authorities\u2019 next moves on encryption. Some of the tech companies were surprised by the cryptology charge because it was unclear to them that a license was needed in France for the technology.\nApart from the encryption charge, Mr. Durov, who was barred from leaving France, was also indicted with complicity in managing an online platform to enable illegal transactions by an organized group, complicity in crimes such as enabling the distribution of child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking and fraud, and refusing to cooperate with law enforcement.\nHis case has led to a debate about whether Telegram\u2019s less robust standards for encryption contributed to French authorities so heavily scrutinizing the platform. Harmful and illicit material on Telegram is often out in the open, whereas the contents of conversations on WhatsApp and Signal are only available to the sender and recipient of a message.\n\u201cTelegram is one of the few services that is not end-to-end encrypted by default,\u201d said Zach Judge-Raza, a British barrister at Fieldfisher who specializes in data and privacy issues related to national security laws. \u201cThat could have been part of its downfall because everything is out in the open for everyone to see.\u201d\nIf the history of tech is any guide and encryption increasingly becomes a focus in Mr. Durov\u2019s case, Silicon Valley firms could eventually speak up to defend private messaging \u2014 even if it means rallying behind an imperfect messenger in Telegram.\n\u201cI wish I could say it was a settled debate that more security is better,\u201d Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said in an interview with The New York Times last year. \u201cI think encryption is still under threat in parts of the world.\u201d\nAdam Satarianocontributed reporting from London."
