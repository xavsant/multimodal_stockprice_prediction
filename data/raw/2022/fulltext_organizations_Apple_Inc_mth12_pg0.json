        "title": "The Battle Royale Over Apple\u2019s App Store",
        "fulltext": "Apple is the world\u2019s most valuable company. Is it also a monopolist? To answer that question to your own satisfaction, I suggest that you watch a grippingreality showon YouTube. It\u2019s an hour-and-a-quarter courtroom hearing from Nov. 14 in the case of Epic Games v. Apple. It features brilliant lawyers doing battle before three appellate judges in one of the nation\u2019smost beautifulcourtrooms. And the stakes are high, for Apple and the entire tech sector.\nOutside the courtroom, Apple has gotten trashed in the past week. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook\u2019s parent, Meta Platforms,saidby video at The New York Times\u2019s DealBook Summit on Wednesday: \u201cI do think Apple has sort of singled themselves out as the only company that is trying to control unilaterally what apps get on a device. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a sustainable or good place to be.\u201d\nElon Musk, as if he didn\u2019t have enough on his plate, also went after Apple, saying it was trying to sabotage Twitter, the company he recently bought. He alsoaccusedApple of threatening to pull Twitter from its App Store. By Wednesday, heseemedto have patched things up after a visit to Apple headquarters.\nThe sight of billionaires sniping at one another is always entertaining, but if you really want to get a feel for the legal and economic issues around whether Apple is a monopolist, I recommend tuning in to Epic Games v. Apple \u2014 not just that one November hearing but the wholesprawlingdocket. There are lots of other antitrust issues swirling around Apple, includingaccusationsby the European Commission involving Apple Pay, but the App Store that Zuckerberg and Musk have been griping about is superimportant, and it\u2019s at the center of Epic Games v. Apple.\nAs with so much else in antitrust, this case comes down to how to balance conflicting priorities and perspectives. Apple says it\u2019s protecting its customers\u2019 safety; Epic says that\u2019s just an excuse for suppressing competition and maximizing profit.\nThe back story \u2014 because every courtroom drama needs a back story \u2014 is that shortly after Apple entered the phone business in 2007, it allowed outside software developers to make applications for the iPhone (and later the iPad) on the condition that they follow strict rules to keep out hackers and other troublemakers. The licensing deals made money for the outside developers and also benefited Apple, since the apps made the iPhone and iPad more useful. According toone brief, the number of apps increased from 500 in July 2008 to 1.8 million in November 2020. More than99.99 percentof apps in the App Store were developed by third parties.\nBut some of the outside developers complained that Apple\u2019s terms were onerous. Apple required from the start that apps for its iOS operating system be distributed only through the App Store. It also insisted that if you wanted to buy many kinds of digital content using an app, you had to do it using the function built by Apple. And Apple charged for that functionality \u2014 up to 30 percent of the purchase price.\nEpic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite online video games, tried to bypass Apple\u2019s payment system with a hidden chunk of code, which predictably led Apple to block Fortnite from the App Store. Epic then sued Apple in federal court in 2020, alleging violation of federal and state antitrust laws as well as California\u2019s unfair-competition law. (Epic simultaneously sued Google, which manages the Google Play store for Android devices. That case is ongoing.)\nTo use Fortnite lingo, it was a battle royale. Apple countersued Epic, charging breach of contract. Apple denied it was a monopolist, pointing to competition from the Google Play store for Android devices. In September 2021, District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found for Apple on nine of 10 counts but for Epic on the 10th, ordering Apple to stop prohibiting app developers from directing customers to other platforms where they could, in some cases, buy digital content more cheaply.\nApple and Epic both appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Microsoft, which is trying to build up its own app store, took Epic\u2019s side in a friend-of-the-court brief. The first hearing in the appeals was the one on Nov. 14 that I mentioned above.\nEpic\u2019s lawyer, Thomas Goldstein, struck first in the hearing. Goldstein has argued 45 cases before the Supreme Court, including Google v. Oracle America (2021), in which the justices found that Google\u2019s copying of part of Oracle\u2019s Java software was a fair use.\nGoldstein challenged the characterization of Apple and its App Store as a safe and secure \u201cwalled garden.\u201d He said, \u201cThe only thing that is kept out by Apple\u2019s walled garden is competitors.\u201d\nApple\u2019s lead lawyer, Mark Perry, who rocked a graying ponytail, rejected Goldstein\u2019s dig. \u201cThat is just false, and it is totally disproven by the trial record,\u201d said Perry, who\u2019s also a veteran appeals lawyer. \u201cWhat\u2019s kept out by walled gardens is fraudsters and pornsters and hackers and malware and spyware and foreign governments who wish to hijack the phone and GPS and microphone feature of the device.\u201d\nPerry said that for Apple to allow links or buttons inside apps so people could get around Apple\u2019s in-app purchase functionality \u201cwould be a breach in the wall that bad actors could exploit.\u201d\nWhen Goldstein got another chance to speak at the end of the hearing, he argued that Apple has the right to encourage use of its own App Store but not the right to forbid customers \u201cby contract and by technology\u201d from using another app store.\nApple earned more than $3,000 per second in its last fiscal year. It\u2019s only natural to wonder if some of its success is achieved by suppressing competition. From watching last month\u2019s courtroom drama and reading some of the briefs, I\u2019m thinking that Apple is only half right. Yes, its walled garden is great. But its customers deserve more of a choice.\n\u20137 percent\nThis decline is the estimated drop in China\u2019s imports in November in comparison to November 2021, in dollar terms. That\u2019s according to a survey of economists by FactSet.

        "title": "Apple Details Plans to Beef Up Encryption of Data in Its iCloud",
        "fulltext": "Apple has long promised that what is on your iPhone stays on your iPhone. But that pledge came with the caveat that if law enforcement had a warrant for someone\u2019s iCloud account, Apple could provide a file of unencrypted messages, photos and notes.\nNow, the company is planning to close that loophole.\nOn Wednesday, Apple said it was expanding its end-to-end encryption system to keep most iCloud data indecipherable, even when it\u2019s stored in data centers. The increased protections, which are optional, aim to make the sensitive data inaccessible to hackers and governments. Previously, encryption covered only select information, such as passwords, payment and health data.\nThe change sets up a potential conflict with the U.S. government and other governments that have clashed with Apple over access to data on criminals\u2019 iPhones. ThoughApple has refused to assistlaw enforcement in unlocking iPhones over the years, it has fulfilled thousands of requests annually for iCloud backups that include unencrypted messages and photographs.\nLaw enforcement has been able to obtain confidential messages in high-profile cases, including its prosecution of Paul Manafort, chairman of former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. In the first six months of last year, the company received requests for 7,122 iCloud accounts in the United States. These security upgrades would close off that access.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see companies prioritizing security, but we have to keep in mind that there are trade-offs, and one that is often not considered is the impact it has on decreasing law enforcement access to digital evidence,\u201d Sasha O\u2019Connell, an executive in residence at American University and a former section chief at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u201cThe big question is: Who decides that trade-off? It continues to sit in Apple\u2019s hands.\u201d\nApple hadn\u2019t fully encrypted iCloud data because it wanted to make it easier for customers to retrieve information for users who were locked out or lost access to their accounts. But data breaches have tripled over the past seven years, as more data has migrated to the cloud, spurring Apple to want to enhance its security.\nApple\u2019s new protections are part of a broader push by tech companies to improve customer security. Google recently introduced end-to-end encryption for group chats in its Messages app, and Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp started offering encrypted backups a year ago.\nUsers who opt in to increased encryption for iCloud, which Apple calls Advanced Data Protection, can also separately increase their account\u2019s security by getting a hardware security key, Apple said. The added protection can be used by everyone but was designed to safeguard the data of public figures who can be targeted by hackers, including celebrities, journalists and government officials.\nOnly three categories won\u2019t be covered \u2014 Apple\u2019s Mail, Contacts and Calendar systems \u2014 because they are connected to legacy technology, the company said.\nThe program rolls out later this year in the United States and worldwide starting next year, Apple said. It will be available to customers in China, where a Chinese company manages storage of their iCloud accounts.\nA separate plan toscan iPhones for images of child sexual abusehas been abandoned, Apple said. That proposal, which was introduced last year, facedblowback from privacy activists.\nInstead, Apple said, it will update its messaging system in the future to cover nudity in videos. It will also make the technology behind those protections available to other messaging apps."

        "title": "How Much Would You Pay for Steve Jobs\u2019s Birkenstocks?",
        "fulltext": "How much would you pay for Steve Jobs\u2019s old Birkenstocks?\n\u201cI\u2019d pay to look at them,\u201d Whoopi Goldberg said last week at a party for Birkenstock at Cipriani Wall Street.\n\u201cAbout 75 cents,\u201d she added.\nMr. Jobs\u2019s well-worn, tan suede Arizona sandals, which the Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs famously wore in the 1970s and 1980s as he developed Apple Computers in his family garage in Los Altos, Calif.,were soldfor $218,750 by an undisclosed buyer at auction last month, according to The Associated Press.\nThe shoes were now on display in a transparent plastic box for a crowd that included an international mix of fashion editors and Ms. Goldberg at one of the first major events the company has thrown in the United States. The brand will turn 250 years old in 2024, and the party was a lead-up to the anniversary. Birkenstock executives would not comment or answer questions about how the shoes ended up at the event.\nThe grand room, with its more than 50-foot vaulted ceilings was staged as a giant lush jungle, interspersed with ferns, mosses, banana leaves and hedges. In the middle of the room, a clearing was made for a vast exhibition space, where the brand displayed its treasures, as if at a museum. At the rear, surreal projections of raw materials scaled the walls, while beneath them a Santa\u2019s workshop of edgy elves \u2014 rows of tattoo artists at workbenches \u2014 inscribed fitted sneakers with guests\u2019 personalized details. An entire side room was dedicated to foot massages.\nAmong the exhibited shoes were several of Birkenstock\u2019s most famous fashion collaborations: Marc Jacobs's unauthorized riff from his 1993 Perry Ellis grunge collection; Rick Owens\u2019s strappy sneaker boots; elegant Jil Sander clogs; bejeweled Manolo Blahniks and handmade Dior mules.\nIt was next to these that Mr. Jobs\u2019s everyday Arizonas were displayed.\nDespite the new value of Mr. Jobs\u2019s sandals, the fashion crowd was not particularly interested in owning them.\n\u201cI have so many,\u201d Ms. Goldberg said, wearing a pair of black rubberSuper Birkiclogs. \u201cI don\u2019t need his.\u201d\n\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have any value to me,\u201d said Joerg Koch, the editor in chief and chief executive of 032c, the German fashion publication. \u201cI\u2019m not a collector. I collect books.\u201d\nJames Harris, the co-host of the menswear podcast Throwing Fits, said he would pay \u201cnegative money because those are cooked beyond recognition.\u201d\nBut Mordechai Rubinstein, a fashion consultant who operates the Instagram accountMister Mort, saw the metaphysical value. \u201cYou could say, \u2018I\u2019m wearing Steve Jobs\u2019s soul. You want to touch Steve Jobs\u2019s soul? That\u2019s the closest you\u2019re going to get to it. Slide right in.\u2019\u201d\nStill, Mr. Rubinstein added: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t buy them.\u201d\nAbout an hour into the party, the room was humming. Next to the memorabilia, there was a neatly made Birkenstock bed, which the company has manufactured since 2017. A trio of young women jumped in and took selfies.\nBy the bar, the singerChanese Elif\u00e9performed a rendition of \u201cCan\u2019t Take My Eyes Off You\u201d on a small circular stage, rising above a circle of greenery. Servers wore tan jackets, khakis and Birkenstock Arizona sandals or Boston Clogs, the brand\u2019s mosticonicstyles. The vibe was orderly but relaxed. There were small passed plates of roast salmon, steak or chicken with rice.\nCapucine Lavaune, an aspiring influencer on TikTok, said she would pay $10 for Mr. Jobs\u2019s Birkenstocks \u201cbecause influencing doesn\u2019t make that much money,\u201d she said.\nJian DeLeon, the men\u2019s fashion and editorial director at Nordstrom, leaned against a display of memorabilia with Noah Thomas, the associate fashion director of men\u2019s and children\u2019s at Macy\u2019s. Together they run the Instagram account Mule Boyz, which celebrates backless shoes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an Arizona, not a Boston, so it\u2019s not really in my wheelhouse,\u201d Mr. DeLeon said. \u201cI would prefer a turtleneck.\u201d\nAs the evening came to a close, Oliver Reichert, Birkenstock\u2019s chief executive officer, wearing well-worn suede Arizonas, was entertaining his young children near the Birkenstock bed.\nMr. Reichert, who would also not comment on who owns the shoes, said he would pay \u201cthe middle of doughnut,\u201d or in other words, nothing. \u201cI have shoe size 47, so they\u2019re too small for me.\u201d\nQuick Question is a collection of dispatches from red carpets, gala dinners and other events that coax celebrities out of hiding."

        "title": "The Numbers in the News",
        "fulltext": "The number of major central banks \u2014 the Bank of Japan and the People\u2019s Bank of China \u2014 that didn\u2019t raise interest rates this year, even as inflation threatened global economic growth and sapped consumer purchasing power. Central banks have collectively increased rates by more than 70 percent in 2022, according to LPL Financial, with the same goal: raise borrowing costs to cool rising prices that have been hitting shoppers from London to Poughkeepsie. Many were following the Fed, which increased its prime lending rate to a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent from roughly zero a year ago. The effect: stocks and bonds slumped on concerns that the increases would slow the economy.\nThe value in dollars of Elon Musk\u2019sdeal to buy Twitter, backed by about $12.5 billion of debt that investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, took on to help finance the acquisition. The banks made the promise before technology sector shares crashed, the billionaire tried to walk away from the acquisition, and the market for leveraged loans seized up. Unable to sell that debt without incurring huge losses, the banks head into the new year saddled with loans that will constrain their ability to finance more deals.\nMr. Musk\u2019s management of Twitter has been erratic: He\u2019s fired workers, refused to pay invoices, changed content moderation policies,allowed banned usersback on to the platform, temporarily suspended some journalists\u2019 accounts, been accused of neglecting his other companies and said he would resign as C.E.O. (eventually). But his style has wonadmirationamong many tech executives, founders and investors.\nThe number ofvacant properties in Chinaas of late summer. The world\u2019s second-largest economy has been hammered this year and asharp slowdown in the crucial property sectorhas been one big reason. Real estate development accounted for about a quarter of China\u2019s G.D.P. over the past decade, but a squeeze on the industry caused seemingly impregnable companies to teeter and prompted rare social unrest among unhappy property owners. The lingering challenges facing the debt-fueled housing industry point to structural questions that still hang over the economy.\nThe number oflayoffs in the tech sector, according toLayoffs.fyi. Job cuts at companies includingAmazon,Meta,TwitterandStripehave dominated headlines in recent months, as Silicon Valley faces pressure to downsize. The shift is partly a post-pandemic correction. Companies hired aggressively (perhaps too aggressively)when demand for services boomed as consumers were stuck at home. But as the broader economy slowed in the latter half of the year, companies have been squeezed and tech stocks have plummeted.\nThe number ofjobs createdin the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The labor market is confounding economists. Ordinarily, when economic growth falters, hiring slows down, too (example A: the tech sector). Job growth is ticking lower, but employers are continuing to hire, keeping the unemployment rate a relatively strong 3.7 percent. That\u2019s good news for workers, but it may force the Fed to double down on aggressive rate increases in the first half of 2023.\nThe cost in euros ofGermany\u2019s bailout of Uniper, once Europe\u2019s biggest importer of Russian gas. The utility company has been decimated this year as energy prices soared. The business was hit particularly hard after Gazprom, the Russian energy company that was its biggest supplier, cut gas flows in apparent retaliation for economic sanctions on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Uniper posted a net loss of \u20ac40 billion, or about $42.5 billion \u2014 the biggest in German corporate history \u2014 for the first nine months of 2022. The government nationalized the company to avoid a Lehman Brothers-style effect on the energy sector.\nThe number of consecutive quarters Apple has grown \u2014 a streak that isnow at risk. The tech giant last reported a year-on-year quarterly decline in 2019, but the punishing impact of China\u2019s \u201czero Covid\u201d policy on supply chains and consumer spending in one of its biggest markets now poses a big threat. Apple produces more than 95 percent of its iPhones in China andwarned last monththat it would ship fewer of its newest models after a Covid outbreak and weekslong lockdown at the device\u2019s biggest manufacturing hub. That could have hit sales in the crucial holiday quarter.\nThe amount in dollars of the shortfall in FTX\u2019s accounts when the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried declared bankruptcy last month. The company, once seen as one of the most stable in the sector, could owe money tomore than a million peopleand organizations. Mr. Bankman-Fried was once lauded as an industry leader, able to secure funding from top investors who backed a wide range of causes and businesses,from charitiesandpoliticianstosportsand thenews media. But he is now undercriminal investigation, former top associates are cooperating with the authorities, and FTX has been called \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history.\u201d\nThe length of time that Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood-testing start-up Theranos, wassentenced to prisonafter being convicted of defrauding investors. (Ramesh Balwani, the company\u2019s former C.O.O., was sentenced tonearly 13 years.) Ms. Holmes raised $945 million and her company was valued as high as $9 billion, turning her into one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most celebrated entrepreneurs. But her claims that Theranos\u2019s technology would enable tests to be conducted with just a few drops of blood proved untrue.\nBoeing produced its final humpbacked jumbo jet onDec. 6. The industry\u2019s push for more fuel-efficient planes and the pandemic proved the death knell for the onetime titan of the skies. The plane made its first commercial flight in January 1970. By being able to carry hundreds of passengers at a time, the 747 helped drive a boom in international travel. But its market share fell in recent years, as airlines shifted to more sustainable and less expensive aircraft.\nWe\u2019d like your feedback!

You can read more by visiting the Turning Pointsseries page.\n1. Apple becomes the first company to reach a stock market value of $3 trillion.\nIn January,Apple\u2019s valuebriefly hit the $3 trillion mark, making it the first publicly traded company to do so. Its value has since declined, as it and other companies face a skittish economy still reeling from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and record inflation. Apple was also the first company to be valued at $1 trillion, in 2018, and $2 trillion, in 2020.\n2. Scientists pinpoint how star formation in our galaxy began.\nScientists can explain for the first time what triggered the formation of stars in the Milky Way,according to a paperpublished in Nature in January. Researchers say a chain reaction of supernovae about 14 million years ago led to the creation of a 1,000-light-year-wide bubble, at the center of which lies our galaxy. Though scientists knew this bubble existed, they recently discovered that all the local star-forming regions sit on its surface, because the chain reaction pushed away the dust and gas needed to produce new stars to the bubble\u2019s edges.\n3. Victoria\u2019s Secret features a model with Down syndrome.\nThe Puerto Rican model Sof\u00eda Jirau is the first woman with Down syndrome to become a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. She appears in the fashion company\u2019s Love Cloud ad campaign, which emphasizes diversity and inclusivity.\n4. Microplastics are detected in human blood.\nAstudy published in Marchin Environment International found microplastics in human blood. About half of the participants in the study had polyethylene terephthalate \u2014 a polymer used in water bottles and food packaging, among other everyday items \u2014 in their bloodstream. Scientists had previously established that people are exposed to microscopic particles of plastic through the food they eat, the water they drink and the air they breathe.\n5. An ice shelf collapses in East Antarctica.\nThe Conger ice shelfcollapsed in mid-March, the first such collapse in the eastern part of Antarctica since satellites started recording activity there in 1979. The collapse of the 450-square-mile stretch of ice occurred sooner than expected, according to experts, and in a part of the continent that is considered less vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\n6. Scientists capture an image of the Milky Way\u2019s black hole.\nIn May, scientistsunveiled the first imageof Sagittarius A*, a black hole at the center of our galaxy. It was the result of an international effort known as the Event Horizon Telescope project. In 2019, the same team of scientists unveiled the first image of a black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, which is 1,500 times larger than Sagittarius A*.\n7. Women referee at men\u2019s World Cup.\nSt\u00e9phanie Frappart of Francebecame the first womanlead referee at a men\u2019s World Cup match when she officiated a game between Costa Rica and Germany in Qatar in December. This was also the first men\u2019s World Cup game to have an all-woman referee team: Ms. Frappart\u2019s assistants were Neuza Back of Brazil and Karen Diaz Medina of Mexico.\n8. An Andy Warhol silk-screen breaks auction records in the United States.\nA silk-screen of Marilyn Monroe\u2019s face by Andy Warhol, \u201cShot Sage Blue Marilyn,\u201dfetched $195 millionat a Christie\u2019s auction in May, shattering a record set in 2017 by a Jean-Michel Basquiat painting as the highest price paid for an American artwork sold at auction.\n9.South Korea launches a satellite using its own rocket.\nSouth Korea successfully launched a satelliteusing its Nuri rocket, built by the government\u2019s Aerospace Research Institute and domestic companies. The event ushered in an ambitious new space era for the country and was a rallying point of communal pride. South Korea aims to land a spacecraft on the moon by 2030.\n10. A paralyzed man dies by legally assisted suicide in Italy.\nIn June, Federico Carboni, a 44-year-old man paralyzed for 12 years after a traffic accident, became the first person in Italy to die bylegally assisted suicide. In 2019, Italy\u2019s highest court ruled that assisted suicide is legal under certain circumstances, a widely debated issue in a predominantly Roman Catholic country.\n11. Scientists reveal bacteria large enough to see with the naked eye.\nIn astudy published in Junein the journal Science, researchers identified the existence of a bacterium that can be seen without a microscope, upending theaccepted scientific narrativethat bacteria are microscopic in nature. On average, the species Thiomargarita magnifica grows to about 9,000 microns (0.35 inches) in length. Although Thiomargarita magnifica was initially discovered in 2009 in a Caribbean mangrove forest, it took researchers time to determine that it was a species of bacteria because of its surprising size.\n12. Meta reports its first drop in quarterly revenue since its I.P.O. in 2012.\nMeta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, reported in July itsfirst revenue declinesince the company went public 10 years ago. The social media company, once a Wall Street wonder, has recently sought to remake itself as a power player in the immersive 3-D experience known as the metaverse. But it has grappled with a declining and aging user base, while facing more competition from apps like TikTok.\n13. Women are appointed to high-level positions in the Vatican and Al Azhar.\nFor the first time,three women were appointedto a Vatican committee that advises Pope Francis on candidates for bishops in the Catholic Church. And in Egypt, the Al Azhar Mosque named a woman as an adviser to the grand imam, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, a first in the Islamic institution\u2019s 1,000-year history.\n14. More Americans are smoking marijuana than cigarettes.\nAGallup report released in Augustrevealed that more Americans are smoking marijuana than cigarettes for the first time on record. About 16 percent of the Americans polled said they currently smoke marijuana, five percentage points more than those who reported smoking cigarettes. Cigarette use has continued to decline since its peak during the mid-1950s, when 45 percent of Americans reported that they smoked.\n15. Catholics outnumber Protestants in Northern Ireland.\nAccording to census numbers released in September,more Catholics live in Northern Irelandthan Protestants for the first time since the creation of the United Kingdom territory more than a century ago \u2014 a shift that has prompted rumblings about a possible referendum on reunifying Ireland.\n16. The breaking of the wand of office is televised.\nIn Britain, the symbolic breaking of the wand of office wastelevised for the first timeduring Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s committal service 11 days after her death in September. To signify the end of the queen\u2019s reign, the Lord Chamberlain broke the wand, a staff that represented her rule, at St. George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor.\n17. The Xturismo hoverbike makes its first public flight.\nA Japanese start-up demonstrated its Hoverbike in flight for the first time in September at the Detroit Auto Show. TheXturismo hoverbike, a flying bike that can stay aloft for 40 minutes, will set buyers back more than half a million dollars. Plans for a more affordable electric hoverbike, at $50,000, are in the works.\n18. NASA smashes a spacecraft into an asteroid in a planetary defense test.\nNASA purposelyflew a spacecraft into an asteroidin September, altering the asteroid\u2019s trajectory in a test mission that has implications for future asteroids that could threaten Earth. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, was the planet\u2019s \u201cfirst planetary defense test,\u201d according to NASA.\n19. France sends gas to Germany.\nFor the first time, France ispumping natural gas directly to Germanyin exchange for electricity. Both countries are pivoting after Russia cut off its gas supply to Europe in what critics say is retribution for the West\u2019s sanctions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n20. A Neanderthal clan\u2019s remains are found in a Russian cave.\nScientists haveuncovered the first known remainsof a Neanderthal clan in a cave in Russia, according to astudy published in the journal Naturein October. The findings have led to one of the largest genetic studies of a Neanderthal clan \u2014 including a father and daughter \u2014 to date. Scientists believe this group of about 11 Neanderthals likely died around the same time 54,000 years ago, possibly from starvation.\n21. The first person of color heads the British government.\nRishi Sunak was born in southern England to parents who emigrated from British colonial East Africa. His grandparents were from the Punjab region of India. In October, he made history as the first person of color tobecome prime minister of Britain. He is also the first person of the Hindu faith to sit in that office \u2014 and may even be the first prime minister who comes to the job with more wealth than the British royal family. Mr. Sunak, a former banker, and his wife, whose father co-founded the information technology company Infosys, are worth an estimated 730 million pounds (about $870 million); the late Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s wealth was estimated at about 370 million pounds ($440 million), according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Mr. Sunak was the chancellor of the Exchequer under Boris Johnson. He replaced Liz Truss, the embattled prime minister who served only 44 days.\n22. The FIFA World Cup is hosted in the Middle East for the first time.\nThe 2022 World Cup was held in Qatar, a first for the country and for the Middle East. This is also the first World Cup to take place in the winter in the northern hemisphere. Qatar spent billions of dollars building facilities and upgrading its infrastructure in the lead-up to the event."

        "title": "Detective Sued Over SWAT Raid Based on Wrong Location on the Find My App",
        "fulltext": "When a SWAT team showed up in front of her house in January and demanded over a loudspeaker for anyone in the home to come out with their hands up, Ruby Johnson was watching television in a bathrobe, bonnet and slippers, according to court documents.\nThe SWAT team and Denver police officers had arrived at Ms. Johnson\u2019s home in an armored vehicle with a German shepherd. Officers, some in tactical gear with rifles, used a battering ram on the rear garage door of Ms. Johnson\u2019s home and also caused damage inside the house, court records say.\nOfficers searched for stolen goods while Ms. Johnson, 77, waited in a police vehicle. After several hours, the police left. Their search was fruitless.\nIn a lawsuit filed last week, Ms. Johnson, a retired U.S. Postal Service worker who lives alone, says that a detective, Gary Staab, sought the warrant based on inaccurate information from the Find My app. The mobile application, which helps track down missing or lost Apple products, such as iPhones, iPads and MacBooks, led him to believe that stolen goods were inside her home, the suit says.\nMark Silverstein, a lawyer for Ms. Johnson and the legal director of the A.C.L.U. of Colorado, said on Monday that Detective Staab, the sole defendant named in the suit, should not have applied for the warrant.\n\u201cThe detective did not have the facts needed to justify a search,\u201d Mr. Silverstein said. \u201cHis supervisor should have vetoed it. The district attorney should not have greenlighted it. The judge should not have approved it, and the SWAT team should have stayed home.\u201d\nThe Denver Police Department said in a statement on Monday that it had opened an internal investigation and that it was working with the Denver district attorney\u2019s office to create training for officers about warrants based on applications like Find My.\n\u201cThe Department of Public Safety and Denver Police Department sincerely apologize to Ms. Johnson for any negative impacts this situation may have had on her,\u201d the department said, adding that it hoped to \u201cresolve the matter\u201d without further litigation.\nDetective Staab, who is still with the Police Department, did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. It was unclear whether he had a lawyer.\nHe was assigned on Jan. 4 to investigate a truck that had been reported stolen the day before, according to court documents. The filings state that the owner told the police that inside the truck were four semiautomatic handguns, a tactical military-style rifle, a revolver, two drones, $4,000 in cash and an iPhone 11.\nThe detective interviewed the truck\u2019s owner, Jeremy McDaniel, who told him that he had used the Find My app the day before to search for the iPhone and that it had placed the lost phone at an address, according to court documents.\nMr. McDaniel, who could not be reached on Monday, also told Detective Staab that he had rented a car to drive by the address but did not see his truck. Mr. McDaniel told the detective that he suspected that his truck could have been in the garage of the home.\nThe Find My app was created to help Apple product owners find an \u201capproximate location\u201d of a lost item, according to theapp\u2019s legal terms. The tool relies on a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi and GPS networks and Bluetooth data to show users an estimate of where the lost item could be.\nThe approximate location may be specific enough to identify one household or wide enough to include several buildings, if the item cannot be precisely pinpointed. In the app\u2019s reviews, many users have reported success in finding lost items, while others have said that the app was inaccurate.\nApple, the developers of the Find My app, did not respond to a request for comment on Monday about the suit.\nThe lawsuit included a screenshot of the Find My app linking Mr. McDaniel\u2019s phone to one home, but the radius included parts of other homes and of two streets spread over sections of four blocks.\n\u201cThe screenshot offered no basis to believe McDaniel\u2019s iPhone was likely to be inside Ms. Johnson\u2019s house, rather than on any of several neighbors\u2019 properties or discarded on a nearby street by a passing driver,\u201d the lawsuit said.\nAbout three hours after interviewing Mr. McDaniel on Jan. 4, Detective Staab obtained a search warrant, and Denver police and SWAT officers soon descended on Ms. Johnson\u2019s lawn.\nAfter the raid, \u201cMs. Johnson could not bear to remain in her house,\u201d so she lived with her daughter nearby for a week and then stayed at her son\u2019s home in Houston for several months, according to the lawsuit.\nMs. Johnson has since returned to her home, but she is considering moving, as she \u201cexperiences anxiety living alone in her home and is afraid to answer the door,\u201d the suit says."

        "title": "FTX\u2019s Founder Faces Growing Legal Troubles",
        "fulltext": "Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed crypto exchange FTX and its trading affiliate Alameda Research,remains in a Bahamian jailthis morning, facing an avalanche of charges over what U.S. prosecutors have called \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history.\u201d\nBut the pressure hasn\u2019t let up yet, as Mr. Bankman-Fried \u2014 or S.B.F., as he\u2019s commonly known \u2014 faces yet more charges, fights efforts to extradite him to the United States and confronts the possibility that some of his lieutenants may be working with prosecutors. (He\u2019ll also undoubtedly be pilloried at ahearing about cryptoheld by the Senate Banking Committee this morning, which will also include a \u201cShark Tank\u201d judge and the actor Ben McKenzie of \u201cThe O.C.\u201d fame.)\nCharges against S.B.F. are multiplying.In addition to those pressed by the federal prosecutor in Manhattan, who haslong experience with white-collar cases, and the S.E.C., the 30-year-old faces accusations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that include manipulating the price of his exchange\u2019s FTT token and front-running customers.\n(In a small sign of how seriously S.B.F. views his situation, heabandoned his uniform of baggy T-shirts and cargo shortsfor a navy suit as he was taken in by Bahamian authorities.)\nU.S. authorities will need him to be extradited, however,and a lawyer for S.B.F. suggested his client will contest that effort. His team may argue that the conduct alleged by U.S. prosecutors wasn\u2019t a crime in the Bahamas, though there are equivalent criminal offenses. A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 8.\nMeanwhile, the Bahamian securities regulator objected to statements by FTX\u2019s current C.E.O., John Ray III, about the exchange\u2019s collapse, including those about S.B.F.\u2019s apparent efforts to strike a deal with the nation\u2019s authorities.\nQuestions are swirling about whether any S.B.F. allies have flipped.AtTuesday\u2019s hearingbefore the House financial services committee, Mr. Ray affirmed that he would cooperate with prosecutors. He also listed FTX\u2019s numerous business failures, including its accounting being run \u2026on QuickBooks.\nMr. Ray added that he was looking for evidence of wrongdoing by Bankman-Fried and top lieutenants like Ryan Salame and Caroline Ellison. Unlike S.B.F., other former FTX and Alameda officials have gone quiet in recent weeks, leading to speculation that some \u2014 including Ellison \u2014may be cooperating with law enforcement.\nFears about wider crypto contagion are resurfacing.Binance, the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange,faced $3 billion in customer withdrawals on Tuesday, a stampede that prompted Changpeng Zhao, the firm\u2019s co-founder, to give a trading update on Wednesday and calm investor fears during a Twitter Spaces event. He blamed a brief panic by investors spooked by FTX\u2019s troubles for the withdrawals.\n\u201cPeople got hurt by one exchange, lost a lot of money\u201d and moved their crypto holdings, including from his exchange, he said. He added that the flow had reversed on Wednesday: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing money flowing back in already.\u201d But CZ, as he\u2019s known,warned employeesthat \u201cwe expect the next several months to be bumpy.\u201d\nCongress makes a breakthrough on an omnibus government spending deal.House and Senate negotiators haveagreed on a broad frameworkto fund the federal government in 2023. That puts lawmakers on track to vote on the package next week \u2014 and avert a government shutdown.\nDanske Bank will pay $2 billion to settle money-laundering investigations.The payments to the Justice Department, the S.E.C. and Denmark\u2019s Special Crime Unit willend inquiries into compliance failuresthat led to more than $230 billion in suspicious transactions from Russia and other countries flowing through a branch in Estonia. Shares in Danske were up 1.4 percent this morning.\nApple reportedly plans to let iPhones use alternative app stores.The company plans to open up its iOS platform in Europe, letting users download softwareoutside of Apple\u2019s app portal, according to Bloomberg. The move, meant to comply withnew European rules, would also let developers avoid paying commissions on in-app payments to Apple.\nShares in Moderna jump on promising trial results of a cancer vaccine.The drugmaker\u2019s stock rose nearly 20 percent on Tuesday after the company announced data showing that its personalized melanoma vaccine, coupled with a Merck treatment,drastically reduced patients\u2019 riskof recurring disease or death. A note of caution: The results haven\u2019t been peer-reviewed.\nU.S. efforts to contain TikTok\u2019s security risks hit more speed bumps.Concerns from the F.B.I. and unilateral moves by state regulatorsare the latest challengesto federal officials\u2019 plan to address national security concerns about the Chinese-owned video platform. Meanwhile, lawmakers introduced a bill to ban TikTok in the U.S.\nIt\u2019s decision day for the Fed, and investors are holding their fire as they await news on the central bank\u2019s latest move on interest rates. At 7 a.m. Eastern, U.S. futures were trading flat and European stocks were broadly lower ahead of what is widely expected to be a decision to raise the Fed\u2019s prime lending rate by 0.5 percentage points.\nInvestors got good news on Tuesday,when the latest Consumer Price Index reportshowed inflation continues to slowafter reaching a multidecade high this spring. The C.P.I. has now fallen nearly two percentage points since June; the reading from last month showed prices were up 7.1 percent on an annual basis, below forecasts. That spurred an impressive stock-buying spree at the start of Tuesday\u2019s trading session, as investors bet that inflation had peaked. But markets slid in the afternoon.\nConcern about a slowing economy is a big source of market volatility. The Fed\u2019s aggressive policy of slowing inflation by raising borrowing costs has messed with investor psychology, Lawrence Gillum, a fixed income strategist at LPL Financial, told DealBook. The markets now think the Fed will slam the brakes on rate rises in the first half of 2023, and begin to cut rates in the second half of the year, he said.\nThat view could be mistaken.\u201cWe don\u2019t think the Fed will declare \u2018mission accomplished\u2019 any time soon\u201d on its inflation fight, he said. As long as the central bank tries to keep a lid on prices, there\u2019s a risk that its approach will push the world\u2019s biggest economy into a recession, and trigger further market volatility.\nThe S&P 500 has risen more than 12 percent in the past two months,as data show inflation is in retreat. But if other measures show the economy is contracting, that could squash the stock rally: \u201cThere is a risk that markets could be moving higher prematurely,\u201d Gillum said. That will make this afternoon\u2019s news conference by Jay Powell, the Fed chair, even more important for investors looking for insight into the economy\u2019s health.\nNo one can accuse Elon Musk of backing down from \u2014 or being unwilling to pick \u2014 a fight, with targets as varied as Dr. Anthony Fauci, current and former Twitter employees and Tim Cook of Apple.\nBut there are signs that the Twitter boss is preparing towage legal war on an array of fronts, including not paying vendors\u2019 bills or severance payments due to laid-off employees, The Times reports. It\u2019s the latest indication that Mr. Musk is playing hardball to cut costs at the social media company.\nMr. Musk appears willing to test the bounds of contracts,by not honoring agreed-upon payouts and forcing renegotiations on commercial leases. He has also revamped the company\u2019s legal team, dismissing his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, and using counsel from his other companies, like SpaceX.\nMeanwhile, Twitter has slashed more costs by getting rid of catering staff and auctioning office supplies and kitchen equipment. It has also laid off more executives, including the global head of infrastructure and the vice president of information security.\nNone of this is likely to reassure Tesla shareholders, whoare increasingly worried thatMusk is too distractedby his work at Twitter. The electric carmaker\u2019s stock is down 52 percent this year. One longtime Tesla investor,Ross Gerber, tweeted on Tuesday at the Tesla board: \u201cWhat is the plan? Who is running Tesla and when is Elon coming back?\u201d\nIn other Twitter news:\nJack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder and former C.E.O., conceded that hedeserves some blamefor Twitter\u2019s content-moderation problems, though he implicitly faulted the activist investor Elliott Management as well.\nTo generate more advertising revenue, Twitter is said to be weighing a plan to force users toagree to personalized adsunless they subscribe to Twitter Blue.\n\u2014Ken Griffin, the billionaire financier, in a lawsuit filed against the I.R.S. over last year\u2019s leak of his tax returns to the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica. Griffin accused the I.R.S. of failing to safeguard his personal tax information; the agency has said it is investigating the matter, but hasn\u2019t provided public updates.\nAnyone looking for signs of optimism from the Chinese economy is probably feeling a sense of whiplash. Beijing\u2019s abrupt decision last week to reverse some of the most draconian aspects of its zero-Covid policy is now followed by reports that officialscanceled, then uncanceledan important economic planning meeting this week, highlighting the opacity of policymaking as cases surge in the world\u2019s second biggest economy.\nThe scale of the outbreak is unknown, and the data could get murkier.Beijing is all but abandoning its policy of rigorous testing and severe lockdowns for more lax measures. Health officials now say theywon\u2019t publish data on asymptomatic cases, adding toworries about the country\u2019s Covid preparedness, and raising further questions on the reliability of government information.\nSome Chinese are reverting to lockdown-like behavior.Cities, including Beijing, areeerily quietas residents stay at home for fear of getting the virus or to avoid infecting others, putting a damper on business activity. Restaurants are empty, pharmacies are running out of flu medication and disinfectant supplies, and the usually ubiquitous delivery drivers have almost vanished.\nInvestors are still hopeful for 2023.Business groups say moving beyond zero-Covid is vital for restoring economic growth. Chinese trade data for November showed the costs of Beijing\u2019s highly restrictive policy: the government recorded the largest monthly decline in imports and exports since the start of the pandemic.\nBut underlying economic challenges remain unresolved.Chinese companies are still struggling to access crucial technologies, and the Biden administration is set to place more of thecountry\u2019s businesses on its trade blacklist, according to the Financial Times. Meanwhile, Japan and the Netherlands are in talks with the U.S. to restrict tech exports, such as high-tech chips, to China.

        "title": "Apple Expands Pricing for Apps",
        "fulltext": "For years, iPhone customers who visited the App Store found apps priced at 99 cents, $1.99 and $9.99. The pricing was part of Apple\u2019s policy of restricting what developers could charge.\nNow, 15 years after the App Store was created, the company is ditching those limitations and allowing apps to choose from nearly 600 pricing options, including the simple fee of $1, Apple said on Tuesday.\nRising inflation around the world has put pressure on Apple and developers to be more flexible in what they charge customers. The company also continues to face abacklash from developers, regulators and lawmakers around the world over its App Store policies. The App Store is the only gateway for thousands of apps to reach iPhone users, making Apple an arbiter of software distribution.\nLast year, Apple agreed to introducemore flexible App Store pricingin the settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by developers, who accused the company of having a monopoly on the distribution of iPhone apps.\nThe new prices will range from 29 cents to $10,000, a break from the previous range of 99 cents to $999.99, Apple said. The prices will roll out for subscription apps this week and be available for other apps next year.\nThe $10,000 ceiling could be a sign that Apple anticipates higher-priced offerings, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Apple is developing a virtual- and augmented-reality headset that blends the digital world with the real world, and Ms. Milanesi said the video games and entertainment options on that new device could cost more.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if seats courtside for a basketball game on a headset will cost more than a real game or not, but they could,\u201d she said.\nAdjusting prices country by country and managing foreign exchange rates will be made easier, Apple said. Some app developers set one subscription price for the world and focus on developed markets such as the United States, Europe and Japan. But Matt Ronge, founder of Astropad, an app that turns the iPad into a drawing tablet, said Apple\u2019s increased flexibility could allow him to expand into new markets.\n\u201cIf you can charge a more reasonable price in India, it could open up some possibilities,\u201d Mr. Ronge said. \u201cAny time they open it up in any way, I\u2019m a fan.\u201d\nAs Congress wraps up its year, among the bills under consideration is the Open Markets Act, which seeks to give developers more control over their apps and allow them to skirt the fees \u2014 as much as 30 percent \u2014 that Apple and Google charge developers."

        "title": "Two Women Sue Apple Over AirTag Stalking",
        "fulltext": "Two women sued Apple on Monday over the dangers of its AirTag tracking devices in the hands of stalkers, saying the company had failed to heed warnings from advocacy groups and news reports.\nThe proposed class action lawsuit was filed on Monday in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and accuses Apple of failing to introduce effective safeguards that would prevent stalkers from using AirTags to track people. The women said the devices had been used by their former partners to track them.\nApple introduced AirTags, which cost $29 and are about the size of a quarter, last year as a device that could be used to track personal items like keys and wallets. Other devices pick up their Bluetooth signals; some iPhone users get alerts if a nearby AirTag is moving alongside them. Advocates for survivors of domestic violence warned early on that stalkers could take advantage of the trackers.\n\u201cWith a price point of just $29, it has become the weapon of choice of stalkers and abusers,\u201d the lawsuit said.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The companymade changes to the productsearly this year after complaints, saying, \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms any malicious use of our products.\u201d\nBoth plaintiffs in the lawsuit said that their former partners had used AirTags to stalk them and that they continued to fear for their safety.\nThe court papers said that Lauren Hughes, who lives in Travis County, Texas, learned that an AirTag was being used to track her in August 2021 after the breakup of a three-month relationship. Ms. Hughes\u2019s stalker left her threatening voice mail messages and made abusive posts on her social media accounts.\nMs. Hughes decided to move after the stalker left items outside her apartment. While she was staying at a hotel during the move, she received a notification on her phone that an unknown AirTag was traveling with her. She found it in the wheel well of her car. After she moved, her stalker posted a photo online of a taco truck in her new neighborhood and included \u201c#airt2.0\u201d next to a winking face emoji in the caption, the suit said.\nThe second plaintiff, who lives in Brooklyn, chose not to provide her name and is referred to as Jane Doe in the court papers. She found an AirTag in her child\u2019s backpack this summer after a \u201ccontentious divorce,\u201d and the lawsuit said that her stalker had \u201ca commitment to continuing to use AirTags to track, harass, and threaten her.\u201d\nThe lawsuit documents concerns raised by domestic violence groups, digital privacy experts and in news articles just after Apple announced the AirTag in April 2021, includinga December 2021 article in The New York Timesthat featured interviews with seven women who believed they had been tracked with AirTags.\nIn February, Apple said that it would update the AirTag to make it harder for people to use them to track others without their knowledge. The changes included improving the alert system that lets people with iPhones know that an unknown AirTag is nearby.\nThe lawsuit said that the company\u2019s safeguards were \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d in part because they do not offer automatic protections for Android users, who must download an app to get a warning that an unknown AirTag is nearby.\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for owners of iOS or Android devices who have been tracked with an AirTag or are at-risk of being stalked."
