        "fulltext": "Workers are stuck in their hometowns. Officials want detailed health plans before factories or offices can reopen. Assembly lines that make General Motors cars andApple iPhonesare standing silent.\nMore than two weeks afterChinalocked down a major city to stopa dangerous viral outbreak, one of the world\u2019s largest economies remains largely idle. Much of the countrywas supposed to have reopened by now, but its empty streets, quiet factories and legions of inactive workers suggest that weeks or months could pass before this vital motor of global growth is humming again.\nThe global economycould sufferthe longerChinastays in low gear. It has been hampered by both the outbreak and its own containment efforts, a process that has cut off workers from their jobs and factories from their raw materials. The result is a slowdown that is already slashing traffic along the world\u2019s shipping lines and leading to forecasts of a sharp fall in production of everything from cars to smartphones.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Europe in medieval times,\u201d said J\u00f6rg Wuttke, the president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, \u201cwhere each city has its checks and crosschecks.\u201d\nNew figures show the authorities still have a long way to go before the outbreak can be tamed. On Tuesday, they reported a milestone: the overall death toll from coronavirus in China had topped 1,000. On Monday,the numberwas 908.\nIn a sign that China\u2019s leaders feel increasing pressureto look like they are in control, Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s top leader, toured a Beijing neighborhood and hospital, in what state media described as an inspection of the front line of the outbreak. Chinese officials have been roundly criticized online even in the face of tough censorship for what many see as a slow initial response and the suppression of early warnings.\nOn Monday, a team from the World Health Organization landed in Beijing to work with Chinese researchers battling the coronavirus. Their arrival could signal a shift in attitude among China\u2019s leaders, whohad balked at a visitand have long worked to show that they do not need foreign assistance to tackle problems.\nThe organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited with concern instances of infections among people who had not traveled to China, suggesting that even more cases could emerge. \u201cIn short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\u201dhe wrote on Twitter.\nChinese health officials have been encouraged that the pace of recoveries among victims has outpaced deaths for more than a week. The rate of infection, however, has continued to soar, suggesting that the worst is still to come.\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that restarting China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest manufacturer and a titan of global trade \u2014 would be difficult even if the country made major strides in the next few days toward containing the outbreak.\nUntil then, the damage is spreading.\nOn Monday, Nissan of Japan said it would shut down its plant in Kyushu, Japan, for four days beginning later this week \u201cdue to supply shortages of parts from China.\u201d Other carmakers, like FCA in Italy and Hyundai in South Korea, have already warned that a lack of parts from China could force them to curtail production in their home markets.\nThe China Development Forum, the country\u2019s premier gathering of business leaders and economists, said its annual meeting, set for next month, had been postponed indefinitely.\nGovernment officials had extended China\u2019s official Lunar New Year holiday by three days to Feb. 3 to keep people home. Major business hubs, like the cities of Beijing and Shanghai and the provinces of Guangdong and Shandong, then further extended holidays until Monday.\nAs the day dawned, it was clear that business as usual had not resumed. Traffic in Beijing was much lighter than normal, stores remained closed and many residents worked from home or did not work at all.\nDaimler, the German maker of Mercedes cars, said it began gradually ramping up production at its Chinese factories on Monday. But other major companies said their factories remained closed or were running slower than usual. Ford Motor said that its joint venture with one of China\u2019s biggest state-owned firms was restarting some production, but that it would \u201cramp up our production over the following weeks.\u201d\nGeneral Motors said it would reopen the first of its huge assembly plants in China on Saturday, and would gradually reopen the rest over the next two weeks, \u201cbased on local employees\u2019 safety readiness, supply chain readiness and product inventory needs.\u201d\nChina\u2019s containment efforts are contributing to the disruptions.\nThe authorities have locked down a region of central China around Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak. The local authorities are taking a tough stance with traffic, meaning workers are struggling to return to their jobs. Many towns and cities have begun imposing two-week mandatory quarantines on arriving truck drivers who picked up cargos in cities with disease outbreaks or even just drove through these areas.\nWu Lin, an associate director at a Shanghai advertising company, returned to Wuhan, her hometown, for the holidays on Jan. 21 and had a high-speed train ticket back to Shanghai on Feb. 2. But her ticket was canceled soon after Wuhan was locked down, and she has tried and failed repeatedly since then to find a way out.\n\u201cThere is no point to keep looking,\u201d she said.\nShipyards around the country have run into labor shortages, said Tim Huxley, the chief executive of Mandarin Shipping, a Hong Kong freighter shipping company. Shipbuilders and ship repair providers have begun citing these labor shortages to invoke clauses in their contracts that allow them to delay completion of projects for events beyond their control, he said.\nAside from fear of disease, the country\u2019s nearly 300 million migrant workers \u2014 almost two-fifths of the labor force \u2014 now have another reason to be reluctant to travel to distant cities: Their children are still home. Depending on the province, many schools are not scheduled to resume until Feb. 25 or even March 1.\nEven factories with enough workers are running into further problems. The packaging industry is almost shut down, so everything from plastic packing to steel drums is running out, Mr. Wuttke said.\nLocal regulators are putting up even more barriers.\nBefore businesses in big manufacturing hubs like Shanghai, Shenzhen, Suzhou or Nanjing can reopen, they must now verify the travel history and health of every employee over the past two weeks. They must have frequent temperature checks of employees, hand-washing procedures and a plan to isolate and refer to hospitals anyone showing even fevers as low as 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit.\nMost difficult of all, businesses cannot reopen without approval of their health plans by municipal officials \u2014 and larger operations also have to wait for a site visit from a health official.\nShenzhen, a vast sprawl of electronics factories and skyscrapers next to Hong Kong, issued new health and safety rules on Sunday and said factories that made iPhones and other Apple products would have to meet them before opening. Foxconn Technology, a Taiwanese company that owns the factories, said it met all health and hygiene rules but declined to comment on when production would restart at specific locations. Apple declined to comment.\nApple\u2019s iPhone production, which is heavily concentrated in China, could drop by 10 percent in the first three months of the year, projected TrendForce, a technology forecasting firm in Taiwan.\nThe municipal government in Shanghai, home to more than 20 million people and a vast array of businesses, said only 70 percent of the city\u2019s manufacturers were taking steps to resume production. Few have actually received permission to do so.\nBusinesses \u201cwant to protect staff, but also nobody wants to get caught offsides when it comes to the labor law or the daily announcements from the government,\u201d said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\nIt is not yet clear how the ripples from China\u2019s slowdown will affect the United States. Businesses that rely on assembling a lot of different parts from various suppliers could become the hardest hit. At the top of that list is the auto industry \u2014 a single car may require as many as 30,000 parts from various suppliers.\nAmerican businesses have been trying to diversify away from China as President Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing has made it less economical to manufacture there. But a lot of steering parts, electronics and even door hinges still come to the United States from China, said Razat Gaurav, the chief executive of Llamasoft, a company in Ann Arbor, Mich., that handles supply chain logistics for big automakers and aerospace companies in North America.\n\u201cIf the current coronavirus crisis continues to impact production capacity in China,\" he said, \u201cit will ultimately impact auto assembly plants in the U.S. and Mexico.\u201d\nBen Dooley, Jack Ewing and Raymond Zhong contributed reporting.

        "title": "Apple Signals Coronavirus\u2019s Threat to Global Businesses",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Appleon Monday became one of the first companies to reveal how the coronavirus that has gripped China was affecting its business, saying it was cutting its sales expectations for this quarter, which a month ago it had projected to be robust.\nThe iPhone maker, which is highly dependent on Chinese factories and Chinese consumers, said ina statementthat its supply of smartphones would be hampered because production was ramping up more slowly than expected asChina reopened its factories. Apple also said that demand for its devices in China had been hurt by the outbreak; it closed all 42 of its stores in the country last month and most have yet to reopen.\n\u201cWork is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated,\u201d said Apple, one of the world\u2019s most valuable public companies.\nMany global firms rely on factories in China to manufacture goods as varied as socks and laptop computers. And Chinese consumers, who had ridden a wave of rising wealth, had been avid buyers of luxury goods, iPhones and many other items.\nFears over the coronavirus\u2019s impact on the global economy and business have been growing. As of Tuesday morning in China, more than 72,000 people had been infected by the coronavirus and over 1,800 had died worldwide, officials reported. About three-quarters of a billion people in China are under some kind of lockdown orders,according to a New York Times analysis.\nApple\u2019s action on Monday \u201cis the first of many we\u2019re going to see around the coronavirus impact,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. \u201cApple is heavily exposed. It confirms the worst fears that the iPhone impact was going to be more dramatic than expected.\u201d\nShares in Apple were trading about 3.2 percent lower in premarket trading on Tuesday.\nApple, which is widely regarded as a bellwether of global supply and demand for goods, has bet big on China in recent years. Timothy D. Cook, the chief executive, worked with China\u2019s telecom providers to introduce the iPhone in the country last decade. After that, Apple\u2019s already substantial sales took off further. China is now the company\u2019s second largest market after the United States.\nApple also assembles most of its products in China. Foxconn, the Taiwan company that makes iPhones and other gadgets on behalf of Apple and global electronics companies, has declined to detail which plants have reopened since the Lunar New Year holiday ended butdenied a media reportthat it was aiming to reach 50 percent production levels by the end of this month. None of the factories that make iPhones are in Hubei Province, the center of the coronavirus outbreak.\nCountries including Japan and Germany have already been grappling with slowing growth. Japan, which counts on a lucrative flow of Chinese tourists, as well as exports to the country\u2019s enormous market of consumers, may potentially fall into a recession. And there are concerns the coronavirus could crimp Europe\u2019s already weak growth.\nAs the crisis over the virus has deepened, several large companies have indicated that their production may be hurt and that the damage may spill over into their financial results. China\u2019s giant network of factories, which accounts for a quarter of the world\u2019s manufacturing output, was sluggish in ramping up after the extended Lunar New Year holiday that the authorities imposed because of the outbreak.\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles recently temporarily shut a factory in Serbia because of shortages of Chinese parts. The European aerospace giant Airbus has indicated it is only slowly restarting its assembly line, and automakers like General Motors and Toyota have begun only limited production in recent days.\nStarbucks and Ikea have also closed their stores in China and many shopping malls in the country have been deserted, threatening to squeeze sales for retailers like Nike and others. International airlines, including American, Delta, United, Lufthansa and British Airways, have canceled flights to China, and hotel chains around the world may feel the loss of Chinese travelers.\nAn economic slowdown forChina this yearcould clip global economic growth by 0.2 percent to an annual rate of 2.3 percent, according to one forecast from Oxford Economics. That would be the slowest pace since the global financial crisis late last decade.\nThe next signal of the virus\u2019 impact is expected to come on Tuesday, when Walmart is scheduled to report quarterly results.\nApple declined to comment beyond its statement.\nFor Apple to warn that it will miss sales expectations is highly unusual. The Silicon Valley company has been one of the world\u2019s most profitable firms and it has a cash pile of more than $200 billion. Thelast time it cut its sales forecastwas in January 2019 \u2014 the first time in 16 years it reduced its revenue guidance \u2014 because of poor iPhone sales in China.\nLast month, Apple forecast that its sales wouldrise 9 percent to 15 percentin the current quarter. At the time, Mr. Cook said the company had provided investors with a wider than expected estimate range because it was uncertain about the rapidly spreading coronavirus. The current quarter is usually heavily reliant on Chinese demand because the Lunar New Year holiday is a busy shopping and gift-giving period.\nMr. Cook said at the time that all of Apple\u2019s suppliers in the Wuhan area were \u201calternate sources\u201d \u2014 not the primary suppliers that it depends upon most.\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss,\u201d he said, adding that the impact to suppliers outside the Wuhan region was \u201cless clear.\u201d\nOf Apple\u2019s 42 retail stores in China, it has now reopened seven, but with limited hours. The company is following government guidelines on where it can reopen stores and the hours they can operate.\nEven if all of the factories that make iPhones get back up to speed in China, Apple faces other challenges there. It relies on a sprawling network of Chinese suppliers to provide key components for its main devices. All of those suppliers will need to pass government inspections that their facilities are properly disinfected with proper accommodation for potentially quarantining affected workers.\nApple issued its sales warning just as it was enjoying strong demand for itsnew iPhone models, which include the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro. After sales of the devices fell sharply for most of 2019, the company reported an 8 percent sales increase in iPhones the last three months of the year. Buzz is also building over new iPhones this year that are expected to work with faster 5G wireless networks.\nApple said in its statement that demand for its product and services outside China was in line with expectations.\n\u201cApple is fundamentally strong, and this disruption to our business is only temporary,\u201d the company said."

        "fulltext": "The coronavirus outbreak in China has rattled the global economy, disrupting virtually every major industry, from food, fashion and entertainment to automobiles and technology.\nAnd more than two weeks into the crisis, there is no sign that the economic impact is about to ease up.\nMuch of Chinawas supposed to have reopened by now. But the country\u2019s empty streets, quiet factories and legions of idle workers suggest that weeks or months may pass before this motor of global growth is running at full speed.\nOver the years, companies as varied as Disney, Nike, McDonald\u2019s and Hyundai have come to rely on China\u2019s efficient factories and increasingly affluent consumers. Now the virus is forcing companies torestrict travelto China or temporarily shut stores, offices, restaurants and theme parks. And the disruption to Chinese manufacturers has rippled through global supply chains, making it difficult for companies to obtain parts for everything from video-game consoles to cars.\nIt\u2019s too early to assess the fullfinancial impactof the outbreak. But over the last few weeks, big companies have revealed, with varying degrees of specificity, how the virus has affected them.\nHere\u2019s what we know so far.\nUnder Armourtold investorson Tuesday that its revenues in the first few months of 2020 \u2014 and potentially beyond \u2014 would take a hit of $50 million to $60 million because of the outbreak.\nThe Asia-Pacific region made up about 12 percent of Under Armour\u2019s total sales last year and has been one of its faster-growing markets. \u201cGiven the significant level of uncertainty with this dynamic and evolving situation, full-year results could be further materially impacted,\u201d the company said.\nFedEx hasreached an agreementwith its pilots\u2019 union, the Air Line Pilots Association, allowing crew members to decline trips to China.\nAnother union representing pilots, the Independent Pilots Association, made a similar arrangement with UPS in a\u201cCoronavirus Letter of Agreement.\u201dThat deal allows UPS pilots to take a leave of absence for trips involving \u201ca flight segment into, or out of, mainland China,\u201d the union\u2019s president, Robert Travis, said.\nDisneyhas offered one of the more detailed assessments of how the coronavirus is affecting business. For more than a week, its theme parks in Shanghai and Hong Kong have been shut. The closings are expected to reduce the company\u2019s operating income by $175 million in the second quarter, Christine McCarthy, the chief financial officer,said on an earnings call.\nThe Canadian film companyImaxwasforced to postponethe release of five films it had planned to showcase in China during the Lunar New Year holiday period.\nIn Japan,Nintendo, which makes video games and gaming devices, said shipments of its Switch game console to Japanese customerswould be delayed.\nAnd last week, officials in the Chinese city of Macauasked its 41 casinos to close for half a month. The move will hit American casino operators in the region.\nWynn Resortsis losing $2.4 million to $2.6 million every day that its casino in Macau remains closed because of the coronavirus, the company\u2019s chief executive said.\nTim Cook, the chief executive ofApple,told analystsin January that its suppliers could be disrupted and that traffic to its stores in China had dropped.\nApple has a large sales presence in China and assembles most of its products there. Mr. Cook said that some Apple suppliers would remain closed and that traffic into its stores in the country had fallen off.\nQualcomm, which makes smartphone chips, is alsohurting. Last year, nearly half its revenue came from China, a major hub for smartphone manufacturing and sales.\nThe company\u2019s chief financial officer, Akash Palkhiwala, told investors last week that the company had reduced the low end of its earnings guidance for the next three months because of the uncertainty created by the outbreak.\nThis month\u2019sMobile World Congressin Barcelona, Spain, one of the tech industry\u2019s biggest trade shows, is puttingspecial safety measuresin place, including prohibiting any visitors from Hubei Province in China from attending. Several big companies, including Amazon andSony, are choosing to stay away.\nMany auto plants have shut down in China because of the virus, including factories run byTesla,Ford MotorandNissan.\nOn Monday, Nissan of Japan said it would shut down its plant in Kyushu, Japan, for four days beginning later this week because of \u201csupply shortages of parts from China.\u201d\nHyundai, the world\u2019s fifth-largest automaker,said last week that it would temporarily stop production linesat its factories in South Korea because of shortages of Chinese parts.\nAuto companies had hoped to restart production on Monday, but an increasing number have pushed that off until next Monday.Volkswagenon Saturday cited problems with \u201cthe nationwide restarting of supply chains as well as limited travel options for our production employees.\u201d\nFiat Chryslerwarned that the outbreak could disrupt production at one of its European plants in the next few weeks, Reutersreported. But the company\u2019s chief executive said it wasn\u2019t changing its financial guidance for 2020.\nOver the last couple of weeks, a series of major airlines have canceled flights to China, includingDelta,UnitedandAmerican. But the airlines have said little about how the cancellations will affect their bottom lines. Analysts expect the impact to be relatively small.\nUnited draws only about 4 percent of its revenue from service to China, which accounts for just 3 percent of Delta\u2019s revenue and 2 percent at American, said Helane Becker, an airline analyst with Cowen Research.\nAlso cutting back sharply isAir China, which flies the most passengers nonstop between the United States and China. On Thursday, it was granted permission to significantly limit service between the two countries, theTransportation Department said.\nAir China intends to operate seven flights a week, in both directions. In 2018, it operated an average 129 flights a week into and out of the United States, according to federal data.\nThe spread of the virus has also taken a toll on the cruise industry. On Friday,Royal Caribbeanbarred all people holding Chinese, Hong Kong or Macau passports from boarding its ships. The vast majority of those passengers would be on ships leaving China, which account for only 6 percent of the company\u2019s business, according to Rob Zeiger, a spokesman for Royal Caribbean.\nSeveral hundred of the approximately 3,300McDonald\u2019srestaurants in China have closed. But the company\u2019s chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, said the overall impact on profits would be\u201cfairly small\u201dif the virus stayed contained.\nStarbuckshas closedmore than halfits 4,300 stores in China and delayed a planned update to its 2020 financial forecast, saying it expects a material but temporary hit.\nAndYum Brands, the operator of the KFC and Pizza Hut franchises in China,saidnearly one-third of its restaurants had been closed because of the outbreak. The remaining stores have seen a major drop in sales.\nAbout half theNikestores in China have shut down, and those that remain open have shortened hours, the company said. Nike has not released a numerical estimate of the financial repercussions, buttold investorsthat it expected \u201cthe situation to have a material impact on our operations in greater China.\u201d\nCanada Goose Holdingssaid the impact would be substantial enough that it had to lower its profit outlook for the year, saying customer traffic in China and in \u201cinternational shopping destinations in North America and Europe\u201d has been affected. \u201cNo supply chain interruptions have occurred,\u201dthe company saidin a statement on Friday.\nTheVF Corporation, which owns brands like Timberland and the North Face, announced it would temporarily close about 60 percent of its stores in China. And it said traffic had slipped at stores that are currently open.\nBurberrywarned investors that the outbreak was having a \u201cmaterial negative effect on luxury demand.\u201d Twenty-four of its 64 stores in mainland China are closed, and those that remain open, with reduced operating hours, have fewer shoppers than usual, the company said.Tapestry, the American luxury giant that owns Kate Spade, Coach and Stuart Weitzman,saidthe outbreak could reduce its sales by up to $250 million in the second half of the year.\nAndEst\u00e9e Lauder, the luxury cosmetics company,warnedthat the outbreak would hurt its financial results \u201cin the near term,\u201d predicting that sales in the third quarter of 2020 would be the most affected. The spread of the virus has slowed air travel and tourism, reducing store traffic in key global shopping areas, it told investors.\nReporting was contributed by Ian Austen, Niraj Chokshi, Lizzie Paton and Carlos Tejada."
