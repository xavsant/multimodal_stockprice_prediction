        "title": "Downloading Mac App Updated Automatically",
        "fulltext": "Q.Does the Mac automatically install updates to programs from the Mac Store, or just OS X Yosemite system patches?\nA.Along with OS X system updates, you canhave the Mac install any app updatesit finds during its daily check-in with Apple\u2019s servers. If you are not sure what your Mac is set to do, open the System Preferences icon from the Dock, or go to the Apple Menu in the upper-left corner of the menu bar and select System Preferences.\nIn the System Preferences box, click the App Store icon. In the box that appears, you can turn on (or off) the check boxes to automatically check for updates and download those files in the background when your computer is connected to the Internet. Note that especially large updates from Apple can bog down your connection if your broadband plan is on the slower side. (If your surfing speed seems balky, a hefty OS X update may be downloading behind the scenes.)\nIn addition to installing Mac Store app updates and OS X patches, you also have the option ofautomatically installing data files and security fixes. (These are usually what Apple pushes out quickly to protect the operating system from Internet threats.) If you have multiple Macs around the house, the App Store preferences also give you the option to automatically download the applications purchased on the other computers with the same Apple ID.\nTo turn onautomatic downloads for iTunes music and videopurchased on other Mac or Windows PCs with the same Apple ID, open the iTunes program. Press the Command and comma keys on the Mac (or the Control and comma keys on the PC version) to open the iTunes Preferences box. In the box, click the Store tab and under Automatic Downloads, turn on the check boxes next to the type of content you wish to download to the machine.\nMoving a Router to a New Modem\nQ.I am switching from DSL to a cable modem. Can I use the same router I bought to use for my wireless network with DSL broadband with the cable modem?\nA. If you have been using a router you bought yourself \u2014 like a Netgear model or an Apple AirPort Express \u2014 you should be able to unplug it from the DSL modem and use it with the new cable modem. Depending on how you set up your network with the old modem, you may have to adjust the router\u2019s settings (liketaking it out of bridge mode) to get it to work with the cable modem.\nYour results may vary with the hardware, but routers supplied from your old ISP for use with your DSL service may be more problematic to switch over and reuse. Check with your cable company about compatibility.\nThe cable provider may have different types of equipment to lease or sell you, and some may bemodem-router combination models. Some providers now charge a monthly rental fee for the cable modem itself. If you do not wish to lease the modem, you can usually buy your own and connect it, as long as the model you choose iscompatible with the company\u2019s network. Your Internet service provider should have a list of approved modems posted in the technical-support area of its site."

        "title": "Working Together in Antarctica",
        "fulltext": "Re \u201cWith deal, China eyes Antarctica\u201d (News, April 24): Questions about China\u2019s motives in expanding its Antarctic operations are paralleled by condemnation for its depletion of Africa\u2019s resources and degradation of its environment. China\u2019s development aid for Africa is motivated by a mixture of altruism, empathy, humanitarianism as well as economic and strategic gain. But in its sprint toward prosperity, China is seen as neglectful of its environmental obligations. As an emerging donor, it has yet to garner the humanitarian credibility that postwar reconstruction help for Germany and Japan fostered for the United States and Britain. It is no wonder that China remains a target of suspicion on the world stage.\nThe recent rescue of researchers, crews and journalists aboard the Akademik Shokalskiy immobilized in sea ice and perilous weather in East Antarctica serves as a reminder that multinational cooperation remains possible despite territorial demarcation disputes and a burgeoning Chinese presence on the continent. As an expedition physician who recently worked on the Akademik Shokalskiy, I was heartened by this veritable united nations of rescue missions. It reaffirms our better angels.\nInstead of geopolitical posturing and one-upmanship, a spirit of reciprocity and multilateralism forced three major players \u2014 Australia, China and the United States \u2014 to work cooperatively in Antarctic waters to implement a challenging, lengthy and risky mission to evacuate scientific crew and travelers from the Akademik Shokalskiy. Despite all the mortal threats to this continent\u2019s well-being and wildlife, I am confident that Antarctica could yet represent a beacon of hope engendered by a spirit of collaboration. The large-scale science advances that we stand to gain from trust, transparency and alignment of purpose could haul us further back from the edge of the ecological precipice.\nDr. Joseph Ting Brisbane, Australia\nThe writer is an adjunct associate professor at the Queensland University of Technology\u2019s School of Public Health.\n\nBig Tech steps over the line\nRe \u201cU2\u2019s flight (turbulence included)\u201d (Culture, May 2): I\u2019m a U2 fan, and was pleased that the latest album was a free gift from Apple. Indeed, I went out and purchased a physical copy of the deluxe edition. However, I understand the public backlash against U2 and Apple for automatically adding the album to people\u2019s digital music libraries. In this article about U2\u2019s preparation for its upcoming tour, Bono says, \u201cApple and we got a lot of the backlash that was headed to Big Tech for knowing too much about us.\u201d Let\u2019s be clear: The backlash was based on the line between suggestions and decisions, and the fact that U2 and Apple stepped over this line. People don\u2019t mind Big Tech knowing us enough to offer suggestions; we\u2019re used to this. What people don\u2019t want is Big Tech thinking it knows us better than we know ourselves. By all means, Bono or Tim Cook can buy me a book, but don\u2019t put it on my bookshelf.\nColin O\u2019Sullivan, Dublin\n\nExcluding Muslims in France\nRe \u201cSkirt sets off furor in France over secularism\u201d (News, April 30): As a sociologist researching Muslim communities in Europe, I was horrified to read how a school principal sent home 15-year-old Sarah K. for wearing a long skirt seen as a sign of her Muslim faith. How ironic that French public servants themselves extinguish the civil liberties they claim to uphold. Perhaps because I am a Jewish woman living in the once highly Jewish Bavarian Quarter in Berlin, I am particularly sensitive to ever-increasing restrictions targeting one group or another. Sarah\u2019s experience in being sent home from school evokes for me the signposts marking remembrance in my own neighborhood: \u201cJewish doctors could no longer practice medicine\u201d or \u201cJewish children could no longer attend public schools.\u201d I feel foolish for hoping that, following the Charlie Hebdo murders, France would seek to foment inclusion rather than separate and shame its Muslim youth. Some here argue that Muslims are the \u201cnew Jews\u201d in Europe. I pray we don\u2019t make such claims a reality.\nElisabeth Becker Topkara, Berlin\n\nEbola and global health diplomacy\nRe \u201cEbola clinics seen as U.S. misstep\u201d (News, April 13): The writer argues that American investments in response to the West African Ebola outbreak may have been poorly allocated and structured. This perspective risks short-sightedness on three fronts. First, the United States\u2019 efforts to utilize military forces for humanitarian ends represent a key paradigm shift following the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Second, these clinics will remain as long-term infrastructure contributions to the Liberian health system long after emergency efforts have ended. Third, the outcomes of investments in global health cannot be measured simply in terms of the lives saved.\nThe crucial significance of gestures of international goodwill and humanitarianism extend far beyond the medical into the realms of international relations, foreign policy and global solidarity. In this sense, even a flawed response is inestimably better than no response at all. Such global health diplomacy efforts, which of course are never perfect, are therefore nonetheless to be welcomed and supported, not least for the added rationale they generate for international development funding.\nSebastian Kevany, San Francisco"

        "title": "Amazon to Stop Funneling European Sales Through Low-Tax Haven",
        "fulltext": "In the continuing battle between Europe and American tech companies, score one for Europe.\nIn a move that could put pressure on its rivals to follow suit,Amazonwill start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all its sales through Luxembourg, a low-tax haven that is the home base in the region for Amazon and many other large tech companies.\nSeveral European countries, including Germany and France, have criticized the tax strategies of some American tech companies, includingGoogle, which use complicated structures that sharply reduce the amount of tax they pay in individual European countries.\nTheEuropean Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is also investigating whetherAppleand Amazon receive unfair state support through low-tax agreements in Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively, where the companies run their European operations.\nOn May 1, Amazon said that it had started reporting revenue from its operations in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. By altering how it reports its revenue, the online retailer may become liable for larger tax charges in certain nations, though it may still be able to reduce its tax burden through other complex accounting practices.\nAmazon reported a 14 percent rise in European revenue, to 13.6 billion euros, or $15 billion, in 2013 (the latest full-year figures available), according to company filings.\n\u201cWe regularly review our business structure to ensure that we are able to best serve our customers,\u201d Amazon said in a statement on Sunday. The company added that the changes to how it reported revenue from its European operations had started more than two years ago.\nA spokesman declined to say whether the changes were because of growing pressure from European policy makers on American tech companies to pay more tax on their operations in the 28-member European Union.\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\nThe news of changes to Amazon\u2019s tax structure wasreported last week by The Guardian.\nAmazon faces other pressures in Europe, too. In Germany, local unions have held a series of strikes over employee treatment. Both sides have clashed over how much Amazon\u2019s workers should be paid and other benefits mandated under German law.\nThe changes to the company\u2019s tax arrangements, however, are likely to put pressure on other tech companies in the United States that funnel the majority of their European revenue through low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands.\nIn Britain, George Osborne, the country\u2019s finance minister,has championeda so-called Google Tax that imposes a 25 percent tax on the local profits of international companies that are perceived to route money unfairly overseas. The new policy came into effect last month.\nAnd in response to mounting criticism from other European countries, Ireland announced late last year that it would phase out atax loopholecalled the \u201cDouble Irish\u201d that would often be used by tech companies. The structure allows corporations with operations in Ireland to make royalty payments for intellectual property to a separate Irish-registered subsidiary. That subsidiary, though incorporated in Ireland, typically has its home in a country that has no corporate income tax.\nThe Double Irish policy has allowed companies like Google to limit how much tax they pay on their international operations. The policy was phased out for new companies at the beginning of 2015, and will be stopped entirely by the end of the decade.\nYet, despite the growing clampdown on tax structures used by American tech companies and others, analysts say that European countries are still vying to attract international companies through low-tax policies.\nBritain, Ireland and the Netherlands have already created new policies that allow companies to apply for a lower tax rate on profits that result from certain patents that are held locally.\nThe European Commission, however, is currently reviewing the legality of these so-called patent boxes."

        "fulltext": "\nQ.Can I forward an iPhone 6 text message to someone who wasn\u2019t in the original conversation? Also, how long do messages last before they disappear?\nA.You can forward a text message received inApple\u2019s Messages appto another person with a couple of steps. With the message you want to forward on the screen, press and hold the message bubble until a menu with Copy and More\u2026 buttons appears. Tap the More\u2026 button.\nNext, make sure the message has a blue check mark next to it and then tap the arrow icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen. The New Message window appears with the selected message attached. In the To: field at the top of the screen, enter the name or number of the person getting the message and hit the Send button.\nAs for the life span of text messages on the iPhone, you can keep them around indefinitely, or give them an expiration period. On the Home screen, tap the Settings icon, flick down the list on the next screen and select Messages. Move down the list of settings and tap Message History. Here, you can choose the specific length of time you want to keep the messages on your phone: 30 Days, One Year or Forever.\nTracking Pages Read in the Kindle App\nQ.Is there any way to turn off the Amazon automatic page synchronization if two people are reading the same book with the Kindle app on two different tablets and don\u2019t want to keep seeing alerts about what page number the other person is on?\nA.Amazon allows you to read the same book on multiple devices without losing your place, but the system is meant for one reader using the same book. For instance, you can start reading on a Kindle tablet at home, pick up where you left off on your phone\u2019s Kindle app during your commute and then continue from your last stopping point when you return to the Kindle. The company uses its online Whispersync technology to track your page progress across each device you use, as long as the e-readers and Kindle apps are all registered to the same Amazon account.\nWhen two people are using one Amazon account while reading the same book on separate devices, Whispersync still notes the furthest page read each time and offers to update other devices in the mix with an alert box noting the new stopping point. This can be especially annoying if one person reads faster or more frequently than the other.\nYou can always choose No in the alert box to keep your own place in the pages, or you can turn off Whispersync \u2014 at least until you both finish the book. To temporarily disable the automatic synchronization, log into your Amazon account and proceed to theManage Your Content and Devicespage. Select the Settings tab, scroll down to Device Synchronization (Whispersync Settings) and turn the button to Off. Later, if you both are reading different books on multiple screens, you can return to the settings and reactivate Whispersync to keep track of the page progress through each title."

        "title": "Is Your Child Your Excuse to Buy an Apple Watch?",
        "fulltext": "The Apple Watch does exactly what I wanted it to do \u2014 but it\u2019s not the killer app for parents. Yet.\nI\u2019ve had the Apple Watch for almost three weeks (no special New York Times treatment; I set an alarm for 3 a.m. on the first day you could order one, and had it in my hands on the first day they shipped). It\u2019s\n                                        handy. I look at my phone less than I did before, whether I\u2019m in a meeting or with my family. If there is something I need to be alerted to, I know the watch will let me know. I also pull my phone out less\n                                        often because, ridiculously enough, I\u2019m now wearing \u2014 wait for it \u2014 a watch. Meaning I don\u2019t need to look at my phone every time I want to know what time it is, and I don\u2019t get\n                                        sucked into its many possibilities as often.\nMy practical, parental reason for wanting the watch was simple: I\u2019m frequently in a meeting or other position where it is difficult or rude to check my phone, yet I need to be reachable. I\u2019ve had to leave\n                                        my phone on, or at least face up on the table, far too often. On the flip side, I often need to be reachable for work, sometimes by email, but I don\u2019t want to be picking up my phone constantly to see if that\n                                        email has come in.\nThe Apple Watch does exactly what I want in that respect; it alerts me only when emails are from certain people, and if there is an incoming call, I can tell at a glance who\u2019s calling, or silence the watch/stop\n                                        the notification vibration with a discreet hand over my wrist. I can leave my phone in my bag.\nAs a bonus, I can also leave my phone on my dresser when I\u2019m at home. I\u2019m heavily dependent on texts with certain friends; our weekends are full of \u201cwanna go for a walk,\u201d \u201cdoes L want\n                                        to come over\u201d or other things that can mean disappointment if I don\u2019t see them in time, but I\u2019ve never liked keeping the phone on me at home. Another first world problem solved. Finally, the\n                                        Apple Watch ended my constant phone hunts. I would open the Find My iPhone app on my desktop, set the phone to ping and then find it under a magazine on the counter. Now I can set off that same ping with a few swipes\n                                        on my wrist.\nBut are those solutions that are worth, at a minimum, a $349 investment? That\u2019s a personal call, based on budget and interest. They are to me; I\u2019ve been looking for something that had that functionality\n                                        for years. But ultimately they\u2019re no more than an extension of what the phone already does, and does well \u2014 and to make it all work the way I wanted it to took time and effort as well as trial and\n                                        error. (Apple is happy to help you through that process, at its stores or on the phone; when I needed help figuring out something, I filled out a form to request a call from support, and the phone rang faster than\n                                        I thought possible.)\nWe can count on Apple, and app developers, to find ways to make the Apple Watch indispensable for parents that go beyond staying constantly connected. For now, there are some fun (pregnancymonitoringapps) and some convenience (you can monitor volume and other settings from the watch while your toddler watches\n                                        theNick Jr. appon your iPhone). For parents of teenagers driving some models of post-2014 Volkswagens, there areserious monitoring possibilities:\n                                        The watch can alert you if the car leaves a designated area or exceeds a preset speed limit. The future holds watch-enabled baby monitors and, surely, virtual toddler leashes. Already, a parent and a teenager could\n                                        use Apple Watches to stay more closely connected \u2014 if, that is, you\u2019re willing to spring for a second watch.\nWhat about the rest of the watch\u2019s functions? I\u2019m delighted with mine. I\u2019m more active, because I can\u2019t bear not to achieve the 30-minute daily exercise goal that is included in the watch\u2019s\n                                        Activity Monitor. That is an improvement over my Jawbone Up band, which spurred me to take 10,000 steps daily, but not at any particular effort level. That same app also alerts me to stand every hour (a setting\n                                        that can be turned off, but that I appreciate).\nYou can use the watch to carry on a phone conversation without a headset, which works reasonably well in my home, but would be deeply annoying to anyone around anywhere else. There is a bit of a lag, and some volume\n                                        difficulties that left me talking into my wrist \u00e0 la Dick Tracy more than once. Now that I\u2019ve made the text as big as it can be, because my eyes are failing, I really do like being able to be in easy\n                                        text contact with the few people I text with frequently. That part of it is every child\u2019s secret agent dream, although, because only one of my favorite texting buddies has an Apple Watch, the opportunities\n                                        to send one another our heartbeats are limited (and once you\u2019ve drawn and sent one little happy face with your finger, you\u2019ve drawn and sent them all).\nI\u2019ve paid for coffee at Starbucks, which I found entertaining, but no more convenient than paying with my iPhone. I\u2019ve used the remote-control camera app to take a family picture; I\u2019ve set quick\n                                        timers for cooking or to remind me to stop working and go pick up my kids when I know I\u2019m likely to become engrossed and lose track of time. I use the workout timer daily. I enjoy and appreciate the functions\n                                        of the watch, but it is not (unlike the iPhone) itself an entertainment device \u2014 I added one game app (Rules) but haven\u2019t found myself even slightly inclined to hold up one hand while poking at the\n                                        game with the other.\nI like the watch for itself. I turn my wrist and see the time and the date, and a butterfly opens its wings. That makes me happy every time, although occasionally the face fails to light up until I flip my wrist more\n                                        emphatically, making me look, in public, as though I\u2019m trying to draw attention to my pretty new toy. Unlike what happened when I tried to wear Google Glass in public, the watch hasn\u2019t attracted attention\n                                        from strangers. It\u2019s no bigger than the watch my stylish cousin wears daily (we compared). It looks like a watch (although one that\u2019s not helpful to anyone trying to peer over your shoulder to see\n                                        the time), and I haven\u2019t had a new watch in a long time. I\u2019m happy.\nSo, sure, you can use your child to justify your Apple Watch purchase. Or your fitness needs. Or your secret agent dreams."

        "title": "Snapping the Windows Screen",
        "fulltext": "Q.How do you take a screenshot on a Windows 8.1 tablet if you don\u2019t have a real keyboard with a PrtScrn key?\nA.There are at least three ways to take tablet screenshots without using a third-party app. On Microsoft\u2019s own Surface tablets, hold down the Windows button on the front, then quickly press the Volume Down button on the device. Once you press and release the Volume Down button, the tablet\u2019s screen should dim slightly to indicate that the screenshot has been captured.\nThe resulting image is saved in the .png format (Portable Network Graphics) inside the Screenshots folder tucked in the tablet\u2019s Pictures folder or Photos app. The screenshot process is similar on many Windows-basedDellandNokia Lumia tablets, but check with the manufacturer for instructions if the Windows and Volume Down button combination does not work on your device.\nAs an alternative, you can quickly mail images of your current tablet\u2019s desktop by way of the WindowsCharms bar; just drag your finger in from the right edge of the screen to reveal the Charms icons. Tap the Share icon and under Screenshot, tap Mail to capture the image and attach it to an outgoing message. If you have social media accounts, you should see their icons for sharing in the Charms bar, too.\nFor more screenshot control, you can also use theSnipping Toolutility, which first arrived with Windows Vista and lives on in the current Windows 8.1 operating system. To find it, open the Charms bar, tap the Search icon and enter \u201csnipping tool\u201d in the box. In the search results, tap Snipping Tool.\nWhen the Snipping Tool program opens, tap the New button and select the type of \u201csnip\u201d you want to use, like a full-screen or a single-window screenshot. Tap the screen to capture your shot. You can edit and save the image from the Snipping Tool to your Pictures folder.\nQ.I don\u2019t care for the Photos app that replaced iPhoto in the latest Mac update. Can I get iPhoto back?\nA.Apple\u2019snew Photos programis intended to replace both its olderiPhotoandAperturesoftware for picture-editing and management. The Photos icon even supplants iPhoto in the Dock after you upgrade to OS X 10.10.3, but iPhoto is not removed from your Mac andyou can still find itin the Applications folder.\nWhen you open iPhoto, however, Apple does remind you that your photo library has been moved to the Photos app. You can still work in iPhoto, but new pictures you add or edit there stay in the now-retired program.\nTIP OF THE WEEKIf entering your password to download a free app seems like an unnecessary step, you can skip it with Apple\u2019srecent iOS 8.3 update.

        "title": "Google and Apple Adjust Strategies on Mobile Payments",
        "fulltext": "The battle for mobile software dominance revolves around two companies: Apple and Google. Now both giants are also going head-to-head in mobile payments, as they prepare to push deeper into digital wallets.\nGoogle is set to unveil plans at its annual developer conference on Thursday for an overhaul of its mobile payment products, according to three people familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition they not be named because the details are confidential.\nChanges include a service called Android Pay that will let merchants accept credit card payments from inside their mobile apps and can be integrated with loyalty programs at retailers, the people said. Google Wallet, a mobile commerce app, will also be reintroduced as a peer-to-peer payments app that consumers can use to send money to each other directly from their debit accounts, they said.\nApple is preparing to announce details about enhancements to Apple Pay at its software conference next month. Those include a rewards program for the mobile wallet service, said two people briefed on the product.\nThe moves are the latest advances in mobile payments as several players jockey for an edge. With more consumers willing to make purchases using smartphones, companies are rushing to take the lead in the market, spurring eBay\u2019s PayPal to heavily market a suite of mobile apps, while start-ups like Square and Stripe expand their payments processing software to small and midsize businesses.\nThe stakes are also high for Apple and Google, which are entering mobile payments later than others in the industry. For Apple, mobile payments tie people more directly to its main product, the iPhone. For Google, payments are a hook to reel people into its ecosystem of services and another way to gain insight about consumers.\n\u201cThey want to be as disruptive to payments as Amazon has been to retail,\u201d said Sucharita Mulpuru, a retail and payments analyst for Forrester Research. \u201cBy being early they can shape the customer experience and expectations.\u201d\nAnaik Weid, a Google spokeswoman, declined to comment, as did Laura Newell, an Apple spokeswoman.\nThe challenge for Apple and Google, along with rivals, is that the mobile wallet is generally a technology in search of a problem. Cash and credit cards are easy to use and accepted broadly worldwide. As a result, the mobile wallet is typically more of a supplementary service than a replacement.\nNonetheless, mobile payments are growing quickly. Forrester Research predicts they will balloon to$142 billion by 2019in the United States, almost tripling from $52 billion in 2014.\nAwareness of mobile payments has been stoked by Apple Pay, which Apple introduced last October. Apple has partnerships with dozens of American banks, allowing Apple Pay to work with most major credit cards. Some retailers, like Walgreens and Whole Foods, have said mobile wallet payments in their stores have grown significantly since the debut of Apple Pay.\nBut analysts have noted that a missing piece from Apple Pay was a rewards program to keep users returning to participating merchants. People familiar with Apple Pay said that next month, Apple will announce such a program offering perks to consumers who make purchases with the service, though they declined to reveal details.\nApple Pay remains limited. It is available only on the latest Apple mobile devices, and just a select number of retailers accept payments from the service, said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research.\n\u201cApple Pay has given it a really big shot in the arm, but even that is nascent,\u201d Mr. Dawson said. That leaves plenty of room for another company, like Google, to grab a slice of the market, he said.\nGoogle\u2019s new Android Pay can also be used at brick-and-mortar stores in addition to letting merchants accept credit card payments from their mobile apps, said the people familiar with the company\u2019s plans. Consumers who use Android Pay for a purchase will also automatically add points to loyalty programs run by participating retailers, they said. The revamped Google Wallet will be available for Android and iOS devices, they added.\nGoogle has had trouble getting a mobile wallet to catch on with consumers. In 2011, the company introduced Google Wallet, a way for customers to pay for purchases in stores with an Android phone. The project was riddled with problems; issuing banks and the large credit card networks were not on board, and mobile carriers hampered Google\u2019s efforts to support Google Wallet on Android phones.\nWith its revitalized payments push, Google now is working closely with credit card networks, card-issuing banks and payments processors, said the people familiar with the situation. Retailers, too, are more eager to accept mobile payments products that work with their loyalty programs in order to gain insight into customer shopping habits.\nGoogle has the opportunity to offer its Android payment service to a broad swath of handsets by different manufacturers, while Apple\u2019s payment service is exclusive to its device owners. Yet Google will not be able to control its payment system as tightly as Apple, which could create room for the Android service to break down, Mr. Dawson said.\nAnother potential headache for Google is Samsung, the world\u2019s largest handset maker and the top seller of Android devices. The South Korean manufactureracquired LoopPay,another mobile wallet competitor, this year. That offering could divide Samsung smartphone users who may have to choose between Google\u2019s wallet and Samsung\u2019s LoopPay product.\nStill, Google and Apple offer something that few others can: Hardware, software and an insatiable desire to win.\n\u201cGoogle and Apple have deep pockets and the appetite to invest,\u201d said Ms. Mulpuru of Forrester Research. \u201cThey may create something that is a lasting disruption.\u201d"

        "title": "Steve Jobs: A Cottage Industry of Movies and Books",
        "fulltext": "Three weeks after the mercurial Apple co-founder Steve Jobs died, in October 2011, Walter Isaacson published an authorized biography that many then considered to be the definitive account of the billionaire\u2019s life.\nMr. Isaacson, the former managing editor at Time, had interviewed Mr. Jobs more than 40 times over two years and talked to 100 friends and colleagues for the book \u201cSteve Jobs.\u201d Four years later, though, the fascination with Mr. Jobs persists.\nThis year alone, about a dozen books will be published about him, and two movies will be released: Alex Gibney\u2019s critical documentary,\u201cSteve Jobs: The Man in the Machine,\u201dwhich premiered at the South by Southwest festival in March, and Danny Boyle\u2019s\u201cSteve Jobs,\u201dstarring Michael Fassbender, which will be released in October. (Not to be confused with the 2013 film \u201cJobs,\u201d which starred the younger-Jobs look-alike Ashton Kutcher.)\nThe movies come in the same year as the recently released biography\u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201dwritten by Rick Tetzeli and Brent Schlender, former Fortune staff members and the only book to be endorsed by Apple executives so far.\nThis year\u2019s crop of books and movies feeds the insatiable appetite of Apple fans that has spurred a cottage industry in all things Steve Jobs.\n\u201cThere are dozens of books about Ben Franklin and Albert Einstein,\u201d said Mr. Isaacson, who is the chief executive of the Aspen Institute and has written biographies of Einstein and the diplomat Henry A. Kissinger. \u201cSteve is to our time what those amazing characters were to theirs.\u201d\nThe latest books focus variously on Mr. Jobs\u2019s leadership (\u201cSteve Jobs: Visionary of the Digital Revolution,\u201d by Christine Honders, being published in August); his values (the newly released \u201cSteve Jobs and Philosophy,\u201d edited by Shawn E. Klein); and his image (\u201cSteve Jobs: Insanely Great,\u201d by Jessie Hartland, set for July).\nMore are being released only on (oh, the irony) Amazon\u2019s Kindle. Yet another print book, \u201cDo What You Love: And Other Lies About Success and Happiness\u201d by Miya Tokumitsu, scheduled for August, examines how the follow-your-dream philosophy promoted by Mr. Jobs and others like Oprah Winfrey is at odds with modern capitalism.\nBoth Mr. Isaacson\u2019s \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d and \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d by Mr. Tetzeli and Mr. Schlender, explore the technology executive\u2019s temperament and business acumen.\nBut Mr. Isaacson\u2019s book has been criticized by some Apple executives who say it is an unflattering portrait of their boss. And so they have participated in, and subsequently lauded, the overall more sympathetic \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs.\u201d Mr. Schlender was one of a handful of journalists to have a close relationship with Mr. Jobs for two decades and, among other things, talks about their relationship in his book.\nDavid Kirkpatrick, an author who has written extensively about technology and is the chief executive ofTechonomy, which holds conferences on technology-related issues, said that more books are likely in the coming years as people seek to imitate Mr. Jobs\u2019s impact on many industries: music, publishing, computers and telephones.\n\u201cThey are all intended for people who want to go into business and be the next Steve Jobs, which is silly,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you capture the essence of someone perceived to be a miracle worker?\u201d\nMr. Jobs\u2019s story, Mr. Kirkpatrick suggested, transcended worldly concerns: \u201cHe did not get famous just because he was about business success. He was about beauty and design.\u201d\nSurely a Netflix series can\u2019t be far behind."

        "title": "The Apple Watch: More Than Just a Bracelet",
        "fulltext": "The musings, observations and procrastinations of T\u2019s critic at large Jody Rosen.\nThere is a famous photograph, taken sometime in the 1950s, of Frank Sinatra at Capitol Studios, the recording studio of Capitol Records in Los Angeles. The photo catches Sinatra at the time and in the place of his artistic\n                                zenith \u2014 in the laboratory where he cooked up his greatest music. More importantly for the present discussion, it captures him looking like a million bucks. He is wearing the classic Sinatra uniform: smartly cut\n                                suit, white shirt, jauntily loosened necktie and, needless to say, a fedora, which is balanced on his head at an angle that it would be willful to call anything but \u201crakish.\u201d Sinatra is gazing dreamily and\n                                a bit sadly up toward the ceiling, possibly listening to a playback of a song he\u2019s just recorded. In any case that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to think he\u2019s doing, and I\u2019d like to think that the song\n                                is \u201cIn the Wee Small Hours of the Morning.\u201d\nThe detail that catches my eye is one so small that it\u2019s almost invisible: a wristwatch, peeking out from the singer\u2019s left sleeve. Of course there\u2019s a watch: Frank Sinatra circa 1955 would not have been\n                                seen without one. Nor would Sinatra\u2019s friend and sartorial muse Humphrey Bogart have sidled up to a bar without a watch. Nor would Barack Obama mount the Presidential lectern without a watch. Nor would Jay Z saunter\n                                onstage without the Hublot that he\u2019s rhymed with \u201cyou blow\u201d and \u201cTebow.\u201d\nWhen the wristwatch first reached the mass marketplace, in the 1920s, it was a novelty item, or a novel variation on a novelty: a clock you strapped to your arm rather than a clock that dangled from a chain on your waistcoat.\n                                For a while, wristwatches were regarded as women\u2019s wear, as feminine and feminizing. But by World War II they had become essential accouterments of the modern man, totems of masculine confidence and competence. A\n                                wristwatch says: I am a full-grown adult; I am worthy of your trust and, by the way, your lust. If you have a watch on your arm you are, in the most literal sense, a man with a mission: You have appointments to keep, places\n                                to be, responsibilities.\nA watch also confers elegance. It is discreet decoration, jewelry that pretends not to be jewelry. A watch is an accessory that man can wear without being too fashion-forward; it\u2019s debonair, but not dandy. Crucially,\n                                watches draw attention to the forearm, the well-muscled male forearm that is always there to help in a pinch: The forearm that can pop open the lid on a peanut butter jar without running it under hot water, the forearm\n                                that can peel back a 747\u2019s safety door like the pull tab on an old beer can, the forearm that will gallantly guide strangers down the aircraft\u2019s inflatable evacuation slide, women and children first. A wristwatch\n                                is the last thing that a man puts on before slipping into his sports jacket and slapping Brut on his lantern jaw, and it is the last thing he removes before expertly making love to his wife. Or is it the only article of\n                                clothing he leaves on?\nFor me, anyway, watch form has always trumped watch function. Sure, watches keep time; that\u2019s neat. But in the 21st century, there is no shortage of ways to get the time of day, starting with your cellphone. I wear a\n                                wristwatch because without it I feel vaguely emasculated and infantilized. About a year ago, my watch \u2014 which cost about $33,870 less thanJay Z\u2019s Hublot\u2014 stopped working. For months I wore a watch that was frozen at the hour 9:32; it was right twice a day, as the proverb says, but what did I care? I had my iPhone, which told the correct time all day long. Eventually,\n                                I got a new watch: a blue Swatch that is handsome and chunky and has three big white buttons that\u2026 actually, I have no idea what the buttons are for. I\u2019ve never used the buttons, and I rarely check the time\n                                on my watch. But I wear it every day. You see, it\u2019s a nice bracelet.\nAll of which is to say: I\u2019m not quite the target audience for the new Apple Watch. The Watch, as you\u2019ve doubtless heard, is a watch-plus \u2014 some combination of timepiece, telephone and life coach. Apple\u2019s\n                                promotional literature touts the Watch\u2019s intimacy and novelty: It is Apple\u2019s \u201cmost personal device yet,\u201d offering \u201cinnovation in every interaction.\u201d In practice, this means that\n                                it is small, as wristwatches by definition are, and it can do all kinds of awesome things that wristwatches generally can\u2019t, like take dictation, and open the lock on your hotel room door, and tell you Matt Harvey\u2019s\n                                earned-run average.\nLate last week, because my editors asked me to, I got an Apple Watch. It\u2019s one of the lower-end models, a \u201cWatch Sport.\u201d\n                                It\u2019s a lovely thing; as a watch, a plain old watch, I like it a lot. It has an \u201cIon-X Glass\u201d screen that is nestled inside a 42-millimeter silver aluminum case and a snazzy powder-blue watchband made\n                                of very comfortable fluoroelastomer rubber. It has 10 customizable watch faces, including a few traditional looks, with tick-tocking hour, minute and second hands. I\u2019m partial to the sleek \u201cModular\u201d\n                                look, which I\u2019ve customized to display the time of day, the weather and the \u201cmoon phase,\u201d mostly because I like to glance at my wrist and see Apple\u2019s pretty little rendering of the moon, floating\n                                in the starless sky of the Retina display screen.\nOf course, $399 is a lot to pay for an animated moon. To get my money\u2019s worth, I need to exploit the Watch\u2019s full range of apps and thingamabobs. My colleague Farhad Manjoo, the Times\u2019s technology columnist,wrote, \u201cthe Watch\u2019s software requires a learning curve that may deter\n                                some people\u2026 to a degree unusual for a new Apple device, the Watch is not suited for tech novices.\u201d I\u2019m not sure what a tech novice is in the year 2015, but I do know that, nearly a week in, I am still\n                                poking lamely at the Watch, wearing a pained expression last seen around these parts in 1983, when my grandfather spent a long night of the soul wrestling with a Betamax. I haven\u2019t quite figured out how to navigate\n                                the Watch\u2019s screens, nor how best to use the knob that Apple calls the \u201cdigital crown,\u201d nor how exactly to modulate the different touches \u2014 gentle tap, forceful press \u2014 that trigger the\n                                Watch\u2019s varied functions. I do know that the Watch does a lot of tapping itself: drumming delicately on my wrist when texts come in or other alerts pop up. This is the work of the Watch\u2019s \u201ctaptic engine,\u201d\n                                which aims to efface the divide between man and machine. With the Apple Watch, a reminder about a doctor\u2019s appointment is a thing you feel in your body before you glimpse it on a screen.\nNow, I\u2019m no technophobe. I\u2019m keenly aware that history can be narrated as a series of apocalyptic overreactions to new machines, from the printing press to the bicycle to the personal computer. Also, I\u2019m\n                                a huge Apple fan. I have a more meaningful relationship with my MacBook than I do with all but a few human beings, and my feelings about my iPhone can be likened to those the Sumerian warrior god Ninurta had for his enchanted\n                                mace, Sharur. My default position is: Apple makes beautiful gizmos that revolutionize daily life and, almost invariably, prove indispensable. So I say this advisedly, with the full knowledge that it\u2019s a snap judgment\n                                I may revoke next month, or tomorrow: The Apple Watch is annoying, and possibly sinister.\nFor one thing, I can\u2019t wrap my mind around the Watch\u2019s relationship to the iPhone. The closest analogy I can come up with is that of a suckerfish and a manta ray: an irksome hanger-on (Apple Watch) and a smooth\n                                swimmer (iPhone). You use your iPhone to control the settings of the Watch, which, when activated, does subpar versions of things that the iPhone does very well. You can receive email on the Watch, but it\u2019s hard\n                                to read, and if you want to write a reply \u2014 well, you can\u2019t, you have to write the email on your phone. When someone calls you on your iPhone, your Watch rings, too. I answered a phone call from my father\n                                on the Watch, but the conversation didn\u2019t go well: Every other word was cutting out. (I called my Dad back using my iPhone. Turns out, he\u2019d rung me up to find out how it was going with the Apple Watch.)\nOften, the Watch functions as a glorified remote control for the iPhone. For instance, you can touch a button on the Watch to play songs through your iPhone. But why would you do that? Why wouldn\u2019t you cut out the middleman\n                                and press play on the phone proper? The Watch also has a camera function, but not a camera lens \u2014 it merely mirrors whatever you\u2019re viewing through your iPhone camera. If you want to, you can snap a photo\n                                by tapping a tiny button on the Watch-screen. But again, what\u2019s the point? To do so is to turn a simple one-device action \u2014 grab your iPhone, point and click \u2014 into an unwieldy two-device slapstick\n                                routine. The best use of the camera, I\u2019ve discovered, is to train your iPhone lens on the Watch and snap a pic: the result is an eerie image, aninfinity of screensstretching into the digital void, out towards those far reaches of cyberspace where the ghosts of M.C. Escher, Jorge Luis Borges and Steve Jobs float and frolic, knocking your brain around with badminton rackets.\nOne of the Watch\u2019s most hyped features is its Activity app, which does things like monitor your heart rate, report the distance you\u2019ve walked and tally the number of calories you\u2019ve burned. Also, it pesters\n                                you. When I set up the Watch, I programmed in daily activity goals, and now, my watch won\u2019t let up, taptic-ing me all day long to insist that I stand up, move around, get off my fat can. The principle is a noble\n                                one. In the digital age, we spend too much time sitting down and staring at screens. (A survey released two days before the Watch hit the market found that, last year, 28% of the American population was \u201ctotally\n                                sedentary.\u201d) The Apple Watch tries to split the difference by being both a screen and a hectoring aerobics instructor. But there are contradictions built in. The Watch aims to promote fitness; it also aims to spare\n                                users the undue exertion of reaching for their cellphones. And with a price point that ranges from just under $400 to nearly $18,000, it\u2019s unlikely that the Watch\u2019s taptic touch will reach the low income Americans\n                                who, studies say, are most in need of more exercise.\nAs far as I can tell, the thing that the Watch does best is buy stuff. One of the first tasks I was asked to perform when setting up the Watch was to establish an Apple Pay account, and as a free-ranging virtual credit card,\n                                the Watch works like a dream. You pass your Watch-screen over a bar code scanner and, presto, you\u2019ve purchased a bag of groceries, or a new pair of shoes \u2014 or better yet, by Tim Cook\u2019s lights, five\n                                more Apple Watches. The Watch may be the most ingenious device ever conceived to serve the needs of upscale consumers, a machine that transforms yuppies into hyperefficient yuppies, lubricating the flow of goods and services\n                                into Watch-wearers\u2019 lives and whisking the cash out of their bank accounts.\nCall me sentimental, but I find this depressing. Spiritually speaking, the Apple Watch is light years away from the talismanic watch on Sinatra\u2019s wrist at Capitol Studios. The traditional wristwatch was a Machine Age\n                                contraption shrunk to wearable size, holding a miniaturized version of the cogs and gears that Charlie Chaplin tussled with in \u201cModern Times.\u201d The message of that watch was a classic 20th century capitalist\n                                one: Life is work, a ruthless race against the clock to accomplish as much as you can, before time runs out and your second hand ticks no more. The vision of existence proposed by the Apple Watch is less grueling, certainly,\n                                but more grim: that we live to shop, and vice versa."
