        "fulltext": "To the Editor:\nRe\u201cChina\u2019s Slump Leads to Drop in Apple Sales\u201d (front page, Jan. 3):\nA $50 Huawei smartphone does \u2014 pretty much \u2014 what an $800 iPhone does. So, yes, we can come up with all sort of theories why Apple is not raking it in as it used to. We can blame China. We can blame the millennials, not being as gullible as before and having less disposable income since their student loans are in the tens of thousands.\nWe can blame President Trump, of course. We can blame Qualcomm, for its patent battle. We can blame the fluctuating stock market, as if that were a new thing. We can blame Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, for not being innovative enough.\nOr we can try to accept that things change and that what was \u201ccool\u201d and made sense yesterday might not be so today. This constant demand for the future to be predictable and advantageous is absurd, or maybe just a thing of the past.\nMichele CastagnettiLos Angeles"
