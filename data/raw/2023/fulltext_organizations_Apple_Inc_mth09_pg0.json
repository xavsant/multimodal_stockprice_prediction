        "title": "Apple\u2019s Market Value Falls By Billions On Worries About China Crackdown",
        "fulltext": "Shares in Apple, the world\u2019s most valuable public company, continued to tumble on Thursday after areportthat China would extend a ban on iPhones for government workers. The company is on track to lose$200 billion of market value, with shares falling about 6 percent over two days to roughly $175 as investors react to a potential threat in one of its biggest markets.\nBut the ripples will be felt more broadly: If one of the most successful operators in the world\u2019s second-largest economy is at risk, can any Western company thrive there?\nChina may be making things tougher for Apple.Officialsat government agencies were ordered not to use iPhones for work or bring them to workplaces, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bloomberg later reported that this would alsoapply to other government-controlled organizations, including state-owned enterprises. (Some Western governments, including the United States, already bar public employees from using TikTok, the Chinese-owned video platform, and devices made by China\u2019s Huawei.)\nApplemanufactures most of its hardwarein China, and the country accounted for about a fifth of total revenue last year. Apple doesn\u2019t break out iPhone sales in the country, but TechInsights, a market research firm, estimates that in terms of second-quarter shipments, China was a bigger market than the United States.\nApple has avoided the pitfalls that have snared other Western companiesamid rising U.S.-China tensions, building market share and remaining a sought-after brand. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s C.E.O., praised the company\u2019s\u201csymbiotic\u201drelationship with China in March on his first visit to the country since the start of the pandemic. Apple is a big source of jobs in the country, and even if it wanted to shift operations, it would be difficult to replicate the best-in-class supply chain it has built in China over decades. Some analysts say the reports about a government ban are \u201coverblown.\u201d\nRising local competition could pose another challenge.Huawei, which is under U.S. sanctions that prevent it from accessing the most advanced chips from American companies, caused a stir last week with anew smartphone. The Mate 60 Pro reportedly was fast enough to suggest the company and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., China\u2019s biggest chip maker, are making progress in producing homegrown tech to replace Western brands.\nSome China hawks are pushing for tougher measureson Western companies operating in the country (more on that below). But American C.E.O.s want the Biden administration to maintain communication lines with China, according toGina Raimondo, the commerce secretary. And other brands, including Tesla and Starbucks, have big operations in China that wouldn\u2019t be easy to unwind quickly.\nIn other China news:\nExportsfell for the fourth consecutive month, tumbling 8.8 percent in August compared with last year.\nBut China\u2019scar industry is booming, with exports quadrupling in just three years, and shipyards struggling to build fleets fast enough to move vehicles overseas.\nGoogle settles antitrust charges over its app store.The tech giant said that it hadreached a tentative dealwith a group of states over accusations that it monopolized distribution of apps that run on its Android operating system. But the company still faces a big fight with the Justice Department over search, with the trial set to begin next week.\nThe eurozone\u2019s economy barely grows in the second quarter.Gross domestic product for the blocrose 0.1 percentin the three months ended June 30. That was below expectations, as a slowdown in China and elsewhere hit exports. The report comes ahead of a European Central Bank decision next week on whether to raise interest rates again.\nComcast accelerates plans to sell its Hulu stake to Disney.The cable giant\u2019s chief, Brian Roberts, said negotiations over his company\u2019s 33 percent stake in the streaming service wouldbegin soon after Sept. 30. Roberts talked up the value of Hulu, calling it a \u201ckingmaker asset\u201d and saying it was worth much more than $27.5 billion.\nWeWork seeks to renegotiate nearly all its leases.The move, announced by the co-working company on Wednesday, is an effort to cut costs and potentially shed underperforming locations after it warned last month that it might not survive.\nA contingent of lawmakers has crisscrossed the country in recent months on a fact-finding mission, trying to determine how corporate America\u2019s ties with China intersect with Washington\u2019s increasingly restrictive trade policy there. Their next stop: Wall Street.\nThe House committee on competition with China will hold a series of discussions next week in New York.Chairman Mike Gallagher, Republican of Wisconsin, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois, are leading a delegation to meet Wall Street power players, including several leaders of banks, hedge funds and venture capital firms. On the agenda is a tabletop exercise with retired military generals and financial firms gaming out the geopolitical and business ramifications of a hypothetical Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a person close to the committee told DealBook.\nAttendees will include executives from Apollo Global Management and Centerview Partners, DealBook hears. Also on the calendar: a lunch hosted by Lux Capital\u2019s Josh Wolfe,and a \u201cfield hearing\u201d at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank, involving the former S.E.C. chair Jay Clayton, on the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s potential threat to U.S. financial stability.\nThe committee wants to know more about money flows.Gallagher haswarnedthat \u201cmillions of Americans have become financial backers of the C.C.P. without knowing it,\u201d through their investment portfolios. The committeelaunched an investigationof the asset manager BlackRock and the finance giant MSCI, saying their funds were investing in Chinese companies that were deemed a national security threat or were perpetrating human rights abuses.\n\u201cIt is important that our committee hear from the financial industry about how C.C.P. policies are affecting Americans\u2019 savings and investments, and what Congress needs to do to help protect American investors and our national security,\u201d Krishnamoorthi told DealBook.\nThe U.S. economy may yet pull off a soft landing, but the outlook is uncertain for many American households and businesses, the Fed\u2019s latest \u201cbeige book\u201d survey of regional business shows. Here are three findings from Wednesday\u2019sdata release:\nProfit margins are getting squeezed.Supply-chain costs are falling for many companies, but apparently not fast enough. Businesses are finding it harder to pass on price increases to financially stretched consumers \u2014 credit card delinquencies are on the rise \u2014 and that\u2019s hurting the bottom line.\n\u201cFun-flation\u201d held up through the summer, but will it last?Consumers may have cut back on buying stuff, but they were still splurging on trips, concert tickets and Instagrammable experiences in July and August. The Fed singled out \u201cstronger than expected\u201d tourism spending over the past two months \u2014 but survey respondents said they considered this to be \u201cthe last stage of pent-up demand for leisure travel from the pandemic era.\u201d\nThe labor market has cooled off.Hiring has slowed, and that\u2019s hitting labor costs, confirming findings fromlast week\u2019s jobs report. After huge pay gains in the first half of the year, businesses expect \u201cwage growth will slow broadly in the near term,\u201d the Fed found. That\u2019s a key finding as the central bank weighs whether to raise rates at least once more to help bring inflation closer to its 2 percent target.\nSome of America\u2019s most profitable companies are steeling themselves for a new 15 percentcorporate minimum tax, a provision of last year\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act that is meant to capture revenue lost to prolific use of deductions to whittle down tax bills.\nBut while the new tax is projected to raise more than $200 billion over a decade starting in the 2023 tax year, corporate America and its allies in Washington are stillscrambling to blunt its impact, The Times\u2019s Alan Rappeport writes.\nThe context:Lawmakers have long been concerned about hugely profitable companies paying little in taxes thanks to clever accounting. A 2021 report found that 55 of the nation\u2019s biggest businesses hadpaid no federal income taxthe previous year.\nAbout 150 companies could face significant increases in their tax liabilities under the new law, including giants likeAmazon and Berkshire Hathaway, which have had effective tax rates in the single digits in recent years, according to the Congressional Research Service.\nExperts warn of unintended consequences,like the law encouraging companies to change how they report their profits as they search for new loopholes.\nBusiness has pushed back hard.Large financial firms and business trade groups spent more than $1 million in the first half of the year alone lobbying over the law\u2019s implementation, according to the nonpartisan watchdog Accountable.US.\nThere\u2019s still room to change the details of the law before the Treasury Department issues final rules by year end.\nDan Doctoroff has been many things over a long, high-profile career: a financier, the man who sought to bring the Olympics to New York City, a top lieutenant to Mike Bloomberg in government and business, and a Google-backed entrepreneur.\nBut he is something else, too: an advocate for fighting A.L.S., the neurodegenerative disease that killed his father and uncle \u2014 and now afflicts him. The Times\u2019s Christopher Maag writes about thelatest stage of Doctoroff\u2019s life, as he raises millions to fight A.L.S. and keeps busy while his own body slowly fails him:\nHe no longer tries to see the future. He is here, present, and it\u2019s simple. With A.L.S., there\u2019s no time to worry about time. He flies to Puerto Rico, Knoxville, Detroit and Provence with family or friends from high school. He rides his Vespa to meet his rich friends. He delivers his Target ALS pitch, wins a handshake and a promise for $200,000 or a million. He\u2019s still on the board at Bloomberg Philanthropies and the University of Chicago, still gets dragooned into helping the mayor and the governor plan New York\u2019s future.

        "title": "In Monitoring Child Sex Abuse, Apple Is Caught Between Safety and Privacy",
        "fulltext": "In 2021, Apple was embroiled in controversy over a plan to scan iPhones for child sexual abuse materials.Privacy experts warned that governments could abuse the system, and the backlash was so severe that Apple eventually abandoned the plan.\nTwo years later, Apple is facing criticism from child safety crusaders and activist investors who are calling on the company to do more to protect children from online abuse.\nA child advocacy group, the Heat Initiative, has raised $2 million for a new national advertising campaign calling on Apple to detect, report and remove child sexual abuse materials from iCloud, its cloud storage platform.\nNext week, the group will release digital advertisements on websites popular with policymakers in Washington, such as Politico. It will also put up posters across San Francisco and New York that say: \u201cChild sexual abuse material is stored on iCloud. Apple allows it.\u201d\nThe criticism speaks to a predicament that has dogged Apple for years. The company has made protecting privacy a central part of its iPhone pitch to consumers. But that promise of security has helped make its services and devices, two billion of which are in use, useful tools for sharing child sexual abuse imagery.\nThe company is caught between child safety groups, which want it to do more to stop the spread of such materials, and privacy experts, who want it to maintain the promise of secure devices.\nA group of two dozen investors with nearly $1 trillion in assets under management have also called on Apple to publicly report the number of abusive images that it catches across its devices and services.\nTwo investors \u2014 Degroof Petercam, a Belgian asset manager, and Christian Brothers Investment Services, a Catholic investment firm \u2014 will submit a shareholder proposal this month that would require Apple to provide a detailed report on how effective its safety tools were at protecting children.\n\u201cApple seems stuck between privacy and action,\u201d said Matthew Welch, an investment specialist at Degroof Petercam. \u201cWe thought a proposal would wake up management and get them to take this more seriously.\u201d\nApple has been quick to respond to child safety advocates. In early August, its privacy executives met with the group of investors, Mr. Welch said. Then, on Thursday,the company responded to an email from the Heat Initiative with a letterthat defended its decision not to scan iCloud. It shared the correspondence withWired, a technology publication.\nIn Apple\u2019s letter, Erik Neuenschwander, the director for user privacy and child safety, said the company had concluded that \u201cit was not practically possible\u201d to scan iCloud photos without \u201cimperiling the security and privacy of our users.\u201d\n\u201cScanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems,\u201d Mr. Neuenschwander said.\nApple, he added, has created a new default feature for all child accounts that intervenes with a warning if they receive or try to send nude images. It\u2019s designed to prevent the creation of new child sexual abuse material and limit the risk of predators coercing and blackmailing children for money or nude images. It has made those tools available to app developers as well.\nIn 2021, Apple said it would use technology calledimage hashesto spot abusive material on iPhones and in iCloud.\nBut the company failed to communicate that plan broadly with privacy experts, intensifying their skepticism and fueling concern that governments could abuse the technology, said Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory at the Cyber Policy Center,who opposed the idea.\nLast year, the companydiscreetly abandoned its plan to scan iCloud, catching child safety groups by surprise.\nApple has won praise from both privacy and child safety groups for its efforts to blunt the creation of new nude images on iMessage and other services. But Mr. Stamos, who applauded the company\u2019s decision not to scan iPhones, said it could do more to stop people from sharing problematic images in the cloud.\n\u201cYou can have privacy if you store something for yourself, but if you share something with someone else, you don\u2019t get the same privacy,\u201d Mr. Stamos said.\nGovernments around the world are putting pressure on Apple to take action. Last year,eSafety Commissioner in Australia issued a reportcriticizing Apple and Microsoft for failing to do more to proactively police their services for abusive material.\nIn the United States,Apple made 160 reportsin 2021 to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a federally designated clearinghouse for abusive material. Google made 875,783 reports, while Facebook made 22 million. These reports do not always reflect truly abusive material; some parents have had theirGoogle accounts suspendedand have been reported to the police for images of their childrenthat were not criminal in nature.\nThe Heat Initiative timed its campaign ahead of Apple\u2019s annual iPhone unveiling, which is scheduled for Sept. 12. The campaign is being led by Sarah Gardner, who was previously the vice president for external affairs at Thorn, a nonprofit founded by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat child sexual abuse online. Ms. Gardner raised money from a number of child safety supporters, including the Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation and the Oak Foundation.\nThe group has builta website that documents law enforcement caseswhere iCloud has been named. The list will includechild pornography charges brought against a 55-year-old in New Yorkwho had more than 200 images stored in iCloud.\nMs. Gardner said the Heat Initiative planned to target advertising throughout the fall in areas where Apple customers and employees would encounter it. \u201cThe goal is to continue to run the tactics until Apple changes its policy,\u201d Ms. Gardner said.\nKashmir Hillcontributed reporting."

        "title": "Top Apple Executive Defends Favoring Google on iPhones",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s top deal maker on Tuesday defended his company\u2019s favoritism of Google on iPhones, a pivotal collaboration that has shaped the modern tech industry and is at the center of a federal antitrust trial against the search giant.\nEddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president of services, testified in Washington thatGoogle\u2019s placement as the default search option on the Safari browser across Apple deviceswas motivated by quality.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think at the time, or today, that there was anybody out there who is anywhere near as good as Google at searching,\u201d said Mr. Cue, who was called to testify by the Justice Department. \u201cCertainly there wasn\u2019t a valid alternative.\u201d\nThe Justice Department has accused Google of illegally locking in its monopoly through deals to make its search option the default on Apple, Samsung, Firefox and other platforms. Those partnerships squashed competitors that struggled to get their products in front of consumers, the Justice Department argues.\nThe Justice Department and dozens of states that brought the lawsuit argue that Google used the default deals as a \u201cpowerful strategic weapon\u201d to block competitors and lock in its dominance in the search market.\nNo other deal has been as significant to the government\u2019s case as a two-decades-long partnership between Google and Apple. The partnership has been worth $10 billion a year for Apple, which makes up more than50 percent of the smartphone marketin the United States, according to Counterpoint Research, a technology firm.\nMr. Cue\u2019s testimony has been highly anticipated. While the case is focused on Google, the Justice Department has viewed Apple as a secondary player and the foremost example of how Google has used its deep pockets to maintain its power over the global search market. Should the judge rule in the government\u2019s favor, it could cost Google and Apple billions of dollars.\nThe trial is the first monopolization case brought by the government in more than two decades, part of a crackdown on big tech by regulators appointed by President Biden. On Tuesday, theFederal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing it of illegally protecting a monopolyover swaths of online retail by squeezing merchants and favoring its own services.\nThe Justice Department is also suing Google for illegally monopolizing the ad tech market. And the F.T.C. is suing Meta for using its dominance in social media to kill off competition.\nThe U.S. government\u2019s case against Google promised to lift a veil off blockbuster deals between the most powerful global companies, giving the public a rare glimpse into business deals that have determined how consumers access information online.\nApple and Google began their partnership in search in 2002. In 2016, Mr. Cue took over renegotiations of the deal. The 30-plus-year Apple veteran had risen to be the company\u2019s top deal maker, overseeing agreements with record labels for Apple Music, banks for Apple Pay and Hollywood studios for Apple TV+.\nIn 2016, Mr. Cue met with Sundar Pichai, who was then a year into his role as Google\u2019s chief executive, to renegotiate for a higher percentage from their revenue-sharing arrangement.\nDespite some back and forth on financial terms of a new deal, Mr. Cue said negotiations were never tested to the point that the companies would back down from their arrangement.\n\u201cIt was in Google\u2019s best interest and our best interest to get the deal done,\u201d Mr. Cue said, adding that the company had never considered creating its own search engine to compete with Google.\n\u201cWe provided great customers to Google \u2014 they did an amazing job on the search engine side,\u201d he said.\nThe Justice Department disclosed in questioning that the deal in 2016 also included a provision for the companies to defend the agreement should it come under any regulatory challenges. Mr. Cue said that the provision was written in by lawyers for Apple and Google, and that he believed it pertained toan antitrust investigation in the European Union of Google.\nBut few other details were revealed in Mr. Cue\u2019s testimony. Much of the trial, which is expected to last until November, has been held in closed sessions and most exhibits have been sealed. Mr. Cue testified for about four hours, of which more than half was closed to the public.\nApple fought against the testimony of executives, saying that Mr. Cue and others had already been deposed ahead of the hearing and that business contracts under scrutiny were highly sensitive."

        "title": "How to Navigate Apple\u2019s Shift From Lightning to USB-C",
        "fulltext": "The iPhone 15 (technically, the 17th iteration of the iconic Apple phone) has arrived with a big change that is sure to annoy many of us. Eventually, however, we\u2019ll breathe a sigh of relief.\nAllow me to unpack that. To comply with recentEuropean regulations, the iPhone 15, unveiled Tuesday, will abandon the Lightning connector that has been the method for charging iPhones for 11 years. In its place will be a different oval-shaped connector: USB-C.\nFor the average tech user, change isn\u2019t fun. This all means that when Apple customers buy their next iPhones, they will no longer be able to plug in all the Lightning accessories they have collected, such as charging cables, speaker docks and earbuds. They will have to replace those with new products that use USB-C connectors to plug into the new iPhones.\nThis transition feels like a bit of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In 2012,Apple killed the relatively bulky 30-pin connectoron iPhones to switch to Lightning, a slimmer and faster charging technology, which rendered many speakers and chargers obsolete.\nWhat\u2019s different this time is that most of us already have a USB-C cable. Modern headphones, game consoles and many laptops, including Apple\u2019s MacBooks, long ago adopted USB-C as a standard charging port. The iPhone was one of the holdouts.\nWhy is this happening now? Last year, the European Union announced a mandate requiring all smartphone makers to adopt USB-C as a common charging connector by 2024. In theory, this will allow consumers to buy fewer power cables, which, regulators say, could cut down on environmental waste. Thierry Breton, a European commissioner involved in the legislation, said on LinkedIn this month: \u201cA common charger is common sense.\u201d\nSo we are heading toward an era of standardization in which one type of charger works with most of our electronics, which would be ideal. Many of us are familiar with the scenario in which someone is carrying an iPhone cable but a family member or friend needs a different one (likely a USB-C) to replenish their non-Apple phone or computer. Those days, in theory, will be no more.\nBut as is always the case with any big technology shift, it\u2019s not as simple as it sounds. New dangers lie ahead \u2014 including the ability to destroy your phone with the wrong USB-C wire, phone repair experts say. If you\u2019re going to carry only one cable, it\u2019s more important than ever to be judicious about what you buy.\n\u201cCharger damage is a real thing,\u201d said Jessa Jones, the owner of iPad Rehab, a mobile phone and tablet repair shop. \u201cIt\u2019s very common, and it\u2019s something you need to watch out for.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to know:\nThe first step is to stop thinking about modern charging cables as dumb wires.\nHigh-quality chargers are essentially electronics with tiny circuit boards inside them. On Apple\u2019s official Lightning cable, there are two chips: One authenticates that the cable is made by Apple, while the other acts as a fuse that isolates damage to the charger. In the event of a power fluctuation, for example, only the charger would be destroyed and not the phone itself, Ms. Jones said.\nThe problem with USB-C cables is that while they usually look the same, the cheaper, low-quality cords offer no such protection for your device. They may have the correct oval connector, but inside, they lack chips to protect your phone.\nSo if you need a USB-C cable, don\u2019t grab any cheap wire, like the $5 ones you\u2019ll see at a gas station kiosk. Invest in a durable cable from a reputable company. Brands like Anker, Belkin and Amazon Basics are well known for their high-quality power cables that cost roughly $9 to $30, according to John Bumstead, the owner of RDKL Inc., a repair shop that refurbishes MacBooks. Buy the cables from trusted retailers or directly from the brands themselves \u2014 and avoid purchasing used wires on sites like eBay.\nMany USB-C cables lack chips to restrict the current powering your phone. So if you plug it into a source that charges at a higher voltage than your phone accepts, you could electrocute your phone, Ms. Jones said.\nThe lesson here is to be careful about what you plug your cord into. Those USB ports embedded into airplane back seats, hotel room walls or car consoles are a big no-no because it\u2019s unclear what their charging rates are. It\u2019s safest to plug your USB-C cable only into a high-quality charging brick that protects your phone. Wirecutter, our sister publication,recommends USB-C power bricksfrom Anker, RAVPower and Spigen that do a good job replenishing your phone quickly without damaging it.\nFor iPhone owners who aren\u2019t planning on upgrading right away but need new chargers, the most cost-effective alternative to buying another Lightning cable is to go wireless. The E.U. mandate applies only to wires that plug directly into devices \u2014 not wireless charging devices that replenish your phonevia magnetic induction, such as Apple\u2019s puck-shaped MagSafe, which magnetizes to the back of your phone, or wirelesscharging pads and standsfrom brands like Mophie, Anker and Belkin. So those are fine purchases for the foreseeable future.\nAs long as you own a robust cable and a nice charging brick, you will probably be happy with this transition. The USB-C charging standard is faster at transferring data than Lightning, and there may even be some cool perks, like the ability to plug your phone directly into an external display to look at photos.\nMore important, when you\u2019re traveling or commuting, you will no longer have to carry a jungle of wires in your bag, and if you leave your cable at home, chances are you\u2019ll be near someone who is carrying the same one."

A wave of strikes and the growing likelihood of a government shutdown (more on that below) may not help. The S&P 500 eked out a minuscule gain on Wednesday, after hitting a three-month low the day before. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has retreated to levels last seen in late May.\nHere are three charts to show why investors are worried:\nOil is barreling toward $100.For Fed officials focused on fighting inflation, that\u2019s an ominous sign. Brent crude has soaredroughly 30 percent since Julyand West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, briefly topped $95 a barrel overnight, its highest level in more than a year. If rising energy prices nudge inflation even higher, the central bank could decide it needs to raise borrowing costs further and keep them elevated for longer.\nInvestors are dumping bonds. Yields on 10-year Treasury bills, which rise when prices fall, are at a 16-year high. The ripple effects could be felt throughout the economy because a variety of common long-term loans tend to track the yield on T-bills. On Wednesday, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate rose to 7.41 percent, a point last reached in December 2000,according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\nThe A.I.-fueled tech rally is fading.Investors have piled into large-cap tech stocks for much of this year, particularly of companies that are believed to be primed to profit from the boom in artificial intelligence. The so-called \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d \u2014 Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and the chip maker Nvidia \u2014 propelled the S&P 500 into a bull market in June. But that group is far from its July highs, sparking a wider discussion among market bears who wonder if the A.I. investor fervor was little more thana bubble in the making, even asprivate fund-raising and valuationsare booming.\nAdding to the downbeat mood were worse-than-expected results from Micron, the chip maker that wants to become a bigger supplier to Nvidia. The company reporteda quarterly loss on Wednesday, sending its shares down more than 5 percent in premarket trading.\nHollywood studios and striking actors will resume talks on Monday.Theeffort to restart negotiationswas announced a day after leaders of the Writers Guild of America voted to end their union\u2019s separate 148-day strike.

Unlike most chatbots, which users largely interact with on their own, Meta A.I. is meant to be used by people in their everyday Instagram or WhatsApp chats. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pull yourself out of context to interact or engage or get the assistant to help you,\u201dAhmad Al-Dahle, the company\u2019s vice president of generative A.I., told The Verge.\nFurther down the line, the chatbots might be able to draw on public user content from Instagram and Facebook, another thing competing offerings can\u2019t do.\nBut Meta is playing catch-up,partly because of caution around potential misuse of the technology.The company\u2019s reputation for helping spread misinformation in the past hangs over its efforts to unleash consumer-facing A.I. features. Many of the new offerings announced on Wednesday appeared to try to contain any blowback: For instance, a tool that cangenerate photorealistic imageslabels its output as being created by A.I.\nIn other A.I. news: The iPhone designer Jony Ive and OpenAI have reportedly discussed building ahardware A.I. devicewith SoftBank.

        "title": "Google Says Switching Away From Its Search Engine Is Easy. It\u2019s Not.",
        "fulltext": "Imagine if every time you went to the supermarket, your shopping cart came loaded with the same box of cereal.\nThis cereal happens to be the most popular, so it\u2019s convenient for the store to have it in the cart. If you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s simple enough to put it back on the shelf and grab a different box.\nThat\u2019s essentially the crux of Google\u2019s defense against the Justice Department in aconsequential antitrust trial\u2014 the federal government\u2019s first such case in the modern internet era \u2014 that is now unfolding in court.\nThe government hasaccused Googleof illegally using partnerships with handset makers, computer manufacturers and browser developers to stifle competitors in online search. Under those partnerships, theJustice Department argues, Google made its search engine the default service on an overwhelming majority of consumer electronics, like smartphones. That then deterred people from trying alternative search engines, like Bing, DuckDuckGo and others.\nBut Google has argued that it\u2019s easy for people to change their search engine \u2014 just as simple as putting a box of cereal back on the store shelf.\nThe trial raises questions about how and why we use Google search. Many of us grew up doing web searches on Google because it seemed to deliver the best results with minimal effort. But if something better came along, would we really have known since Google came loaded on most of our devices? And even if we had known, would we have just stuck with Google since its search engine was set as the default?\nI decided to test how easy or hard it really is to switch to a different search engine. In a blog post this month,Google said the change was a straightforwardprocess and offered three examples:\nOn an iPhone, it takes four taps.\nOn a Mac\u2019s Safari browser, it takes two clicks.\nOn Android phones, it takes two taps.\nSo I followed Google\u2019s instructions and also shared the company\u2019s guidance with a panel of three design veterans. The verdict: It\u2019s hard to switch \u2014 and most people would probably give up before completing the change.\n\u201cGod help me, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Ted Selker,a product design veteranwho worked at IBM and Xerox PARC, said after reading the steps to change the search engine on an iPhone.\nHarry Brignull, a user-experience consultant in Britain, concluded about Google search: \u201cMost people will just stick with it.\u201d\nI had similar takeaways. Here\u2019s what the design experts and I found after trying to break up with Google search.\nGoogle said iPhone owners could switch to a different search engine in four taps by opening the Settings app, tapping Safari, tapping Search Engine and then selecting a search engine.\nIn reality, it\u2019s more complicated.\nOnce the Settings app is open, Safari doesn\u2019t immediately appear on the screen. It\u2019s buried under 36 other menu items, so the user has to swipe upward at least twice to find the Safari menu. In reality, it takes six taps.\nBut even four steps would probably be too much for many of us, Mr. Selker said. It might have been simple 15 years ago, when most web browsing was done on stationary computers, but in the smartphone era, someone looking for that setting could be interrupted while on the go \u2014 to hop on a bus, for instance.\n\u201cYou cannot expect people to have multi-stepped memory,\u201d he said.\nWith just two clicks, Google said, Mac users can switch the default search engine on the Safari browser to a different service \u2014 by first clicking on the magnifying glass icon and then selecting a different search engine, like Yahoo, Bing or DuckDuckGo.\nThat\u2019s much simpler than on an iPhone. But not everyone knows that the magnifying glass icon is a button \u2014 it allows people to enter a query in the search bar.\nMore problematic is that switching search engines can be confusing, because the steps are inconsistent between Safari on an iPhone and Safari on a Mac, said Tony Hu, a director at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who oversees an engineering leadership program.\n\u201cOverall, the average person would probably struggle with this,\u201d he said.\nMr. Selker said a better design would have been to make changing the search engine more \u201cin your face,\u201d like a prompt asking users to choose a search engine when opening the browser.\n\u201cIt has to make you aware it\u2019s there until you\u2019ve dismissed it,\u201d he said.\nOn an Android phone, Google said, it takes one long press on the search bar to prompt the Remove button to appear. Users can then tap on it to remove the Google search bar widget from the home screen.\nThis example is especially flawed. First, Google\u2019s steps to remove the search bar widget work on some Samsung phones, but they do not work across all Android devices. On Google\u2019s Pixel phones, for example, when a user long presses on the search bar, no Remove option appears.\nMost important, removing the search widget deletes a shortcut to the Google search bar on the home screen, but it does not change the search engine in an Android web browser. Changing to a different search engine requires a different set of steps. Similar to the path on iPhones, it\u2019sa four-step processthat involves opening the browser and changing its settings.\nThe overarching lesson from the government\u2019s antitrust trial against Google is that when companies make arrangements to become a default option, they are aware you will probably stick with the status quo because switching to an alternative requires awareness and effort, said Mr. Brignull, the author of \u201cDeceptive Patterns: Exposing the Tricks Tech Companies Use to Control You.\u201d\nGoogle said in a statement that it was easy for people to change their default search engine on Android devices and Apple\u2019s Safari. The company added that on Windows computers, which require a long process to switch from Bing as the default search engine in Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser, the overwhelming majority of people chose Google as their search engine.\nWith all of that in mind, and the instructions now in front of you, you can try other search engines. If it turns out that you prefer Google anyway, at least it will be your decision \u2014 not Google\u2019s."

        "title": "As Smartphone Industry Sputters, the iPhone Expands Its Dominance",
        "fulltext": "There\u2019s a general rule about consumer electronics: The older a device becomes, the more competitors appear and prices fall. This was true for televisions, personal computers and portable music players.\nIt was supposed to happen with smartphones. But the iPhone has defied gravity.\nOn Tuesday, Apple will unveil the 17th iteration of its flagship product. Remarkably, at an age in which most consumer devices have lost some of their appeal to users, Apple has increased its share of smartphone sales over less expensive rivals.\nOver the past five years, the iPhone has increased its percentage of total smartphones sold around the world while expanding its share of sales in four of the world\u2019s largest regions: China, Japan, Europe and India.\nIn the United States, the iPhone\u2019s largest market, the device now accounts for more than 50 percent of smartphones sold, up from 41 percent in 2018, according toCounterpoint Research, a technology firm. The gains have helped it claim abouta fifth of the world\u2019s smartphone sales, up from a low of 13 percentin 2019.\nApple has expanded its smartphone empire as the broader industry has faltered. Over the past two years,sales of Android smartphones have plummeted, but the iPhone has suffered only modest declines because it\u2019s been winning new customers. It has done so despite being the industry\u2019s priciest device.\nApple has overcome price sensitivity by creating a business that is reminiscent of U.S. car sales. Like a car, iPhones last for years and can be resold to offset the purchase of a new one. Wireless providers, much like auto dealers, offer discounts and monthly payment plans that make it more affordable to buy the latest model. And customers, like brand-loyal car buyers, are more likely to buy another iPhone than switch to Google\u2019s Android operating system.\nApple has also been lucky. Two of its biggest challengers, Samsung and Huawei, have stumbled in recent years. Samsung faltered in 2016 whenthe batteries in its flagship smartphone spontaneously combusted. Huawei, which was popular in China,floundered in 2020after the Trump administration blocked it from buying U.S. technology.\nThe iPhone has avoided wobbles with a reliable blueprint: Apple annually updates the iPhone\u2019s spare but sleek design and reliable software, and brings it to the masses with an operations machine that assembles 200 million flawless iPhones a year with military precision.\nIn the United States, the iPhone\u2019s popularity is expected to widen in the years ahead. Nearly90 percent of teenagers own an iPhone, according to Piper Sandler, an investment bank.\nFor young people, iPhones equal inclusion. Many choose it over Android because Apple\u2019s messaging service, iMessage, will turn the color of messages from its default blue to green if a non-iPhone user is in a messaging group. The stigma associated with having green text messages is so pronounced that when it came time for Dave Storrs\u2019s 14-year-old son to get his first smartphone, the teenager told his father that he wanted an iPhone or no phone at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a status thing,\u201d said Mr. Storrs, an Army retiree who lives in El Paso. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be treated differently.\u201d\nMr. Storrs, who is 49, has been subjected to the same pressure. For more than a decade, he took pride in being what he called an \u201cAndroid renegade.\u201d He owned a series of LG and Motorola phones, even as his son and other family members pressed him to buy an iPhone. He gave in this year after his family gave him a $99 pair of Apple\u2019s wireless AirPod earbuds.\nEach time he wanted to use the AirPods on his Android phone, he had to manually sync them. The laborious process inspired him to buy an iPhone 13, which connects the AirPods instantaneously. After years of using a free Android phone, he now pays $11 a month for the iPhone. But he says that he\u2019ll never go back to Android because he likes that he can wear AirPods and take phone calls while walking his Catahoula leopard dog, Teddy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just convenient,\u201d he said.\nNew buyers like Mr. Storrs illustrate how Apple is gaining customers. The gap between the two major operating systems is tilted in Apple\u2019s favor. About 94 percent of iPhone customers are likely to buy another iPhone, while 91 percent of Android customers are likely to buy another Android, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a technology research firm.\nThe migration from Android to Apple has accelerated as promotional discounts, financing plans and trade-in offers make higher iPhone prices less of a barrier. Wireless carriers sweetened their offers as they scrambled to gain or keep customers after T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020. When the combined company, the new T-Mobile,offered the iPhone 12 free with a 30-month contract, AT&T countered with a similar deal, said Cliff Maldonado of BayStreet Research, a smartphone research firm. It made switching painless.\nAround the same time, Apple and wireless carriers began more aggressively promoting monthly payment plans. The plans have reduced the cost of a new iPhone to less than $40 a month from the $800 to $1,200 that customers had to pay upfront. The prices are lowerfor people who trade in used devices. The old iPhones, which could fetchup to $640, have been auctioned to buyers in Asia, who resell them at a markup, Mr. Maldonado said.\n\u201cThe phone market is like the housing market,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get equity, and pay over time.\u201d\nIn China, the second-most important country to Apple\u2019s business, the iPhone has become the default choice for people who want a premium smartphone. Samsung was squeezed out of the market several years ago, and Huawei has been unable to make a phone with the latest wireless technology. The lack of competition has helped to make the iPhone the country\u2019s best-selling smartphone in recent quarters.\nBut new challenges threaten Apple\u2019s lead. Last month,Huawei unveiled a new premium smartphone, the Mate 60 Pro, its first to feature chips capable of running on 5G cellular networks. Beijing also directed employees of national government agencies not to use iPhones for work. Instead, they have been encouraged to use domestic smartphone brands, raising the possibility that nationalist momentum undercuts future iPhone sales. The news was first reported byThe Wall Street Journal.\nApple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\nApple may be able to offset a dip in China with growth in India. The company now claims 5 percent of sales in the world\u2019s fastest-growing smartphone nation, up from 1 percent in 2019. Counterpoint Research predicts that Apple could double its share to 10 percent next year.\nThe iPhone\u2019s gains in India have been years in the making. In 2017, Apple began working with government officials to start manufacturing iPhones locally, a move that has improved affordability by avoiding import tariffs. It has alsoopened stores in New Delhiand Mumbai.\nThe new flagship iPhones that Apple is set to unveil this week will feature speedier processors, more sophisticated cameras and titanium rather than stainless steel cases, according to supply chain analysts. The changes are expected to come with a $100 to $200 price increase, bringing the cost of an iPhone Pro to $1,100 and the Pro Max to $1,200.\nBut analysts predict that iPhone loyalists will shrug off higher prices. The increases would be less than $5 a month for people on monthly plans and even less for those who trade in old iPhones.\n\u201cThe economy is doing pretty well, and everything costs more,\u201d said Michael Levin, a co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. \u201cPeople are desensitized to increases right now.\u201d"

        "title": "\u2018Unprecedented\u2019 Secrecy in Google Trial as Tech Giants Push to Limit Disclosures",
        "fulltext": "In a court filing last month, Google argued that it needed its privacy inan antitrust trialthat would spotlight its dominance in online search.\n\u201cOnce commercially sensitive information is disclosed in open court, the resulting harm to the party\u2019s competitive standing cannot be undone,\u201d the internet giant wrote to the judge presiding over the case.\nIt was part of a pattern of Google\u2019s pushing to limit transparency in the federal government\u2019sfirst monopoly trial of the modern internet era. Before opening statements began on Sept. 12, Google filed 35 motions and responses in the case \u2014 nearly two-thirds of them sealed, according to a tally by The New York Times.\nNow as the case, U.S. et al. v. Google, enters its third week in court, it is shaping up to be perhaps the most secretive antitrust trial of the last few decades. Not only has Google argued for the landmark trial to be largely closed off to the public, but so have other companies that are involved, such as Apple and Microsoft. Apple even fought to quash subpoenas, describing them as \u201cunduly burdensome,\u201d to get its executives out of giving testimony.\nThe upshot is that last week, more than half of the testimony in the trial was given behind closed doors, according to oneanalysis. When one witness, the chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo,testified on Thursday, he spoke on the stand for nearly five hours \u2014 of which just one hour was open to the public. At the judge\u2019s request, the Justice Department, which is one of the plaintiffs, has also removed its presentations and evidence from the open web.\nThe lack of transparency continued this week as a top Apple executive, Eddy Cue, testified on Tuesday about acrucial search agreement that Apple struck with Google. The federal government has accused Google of illegally using agreements with companies like Apple to maintain its monopoly in online search and to crush rivals.\nLate Monday, Apple petitioned the court to have Mr. Cue\u2019s testimony on the details of its Google agreement take place behind closed doors because it was concerned the Justice Department\u2019s lawyer could \u201cblurt out\u201d confidential information. Questioning Mr. Cue in open court posed \u201ca substantial risk\u201d of revealing Apple\u2019s business relationships and negotiations, the company\u2019s lawyers wrote.\nWhen the trial resumed on Tuesday, it began with 45 minutes of closed discussions over confidentiality \u2014 including how to handle documents and business details during Mr. Cue\u2019s testimony. Then Mr. Cue testified for about four hours, more than half of which was closed to the public. During his open testimony, Mr. Cue spoke in generalities about how Apple teamed up with Google and revealed few details about the contracts, while the Justice Department presented few exhibits.\n\u201cThe secrecy surrounding the proceedings is unprecedented in antitrust trials,\u201d Diane Rulke, an organizational behavior professor at Carnegie Mellon, said in an interview. Four other antitrust experts interviewed by The Times also described the proceedings as unusually opaque, adding that the government\u2019s antitrust case against Microsoft more than 24 years ago was far more accessible to the public and the press.\nGoogle and the Justice Department declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe secrecy has angered legal and antitrust experts. In addition, Digital Content Next, a trade group and Google critic that represents the business interests of media companies including The Times, filed a court motion to make testimony from witnesses public and to provide access to trial exhibits and emails. The judge,Amit P. Mehtaof U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, has not responded to the motion, according to the trade group\u2019s head, Jason Kint.\nRandal C. Picker, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an interview that the public should be able to monitor and scrutinize arguments from the case in real time, to hold the parties accountable.\n\u201cThe public should be looking at this \u2014 staring at Google and staring at D.O.J.,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are both very powerful actors here.\u201d\nBut opening up the trial appears unlikely. Judge Mehta said in a pretrial hearing last month that he was not a businessperson and indicated that he was amenable to companies\u2019 arguments that they needed to protect the details of their businesses.\n\u201cI am not anyone that understands the industry and the markets in the way that you do,\u201d Judge Mehta said. \u201cAnd so I take seriously when companies are telling me that if this gets disclosed, it\u2019s going to cause competitive harm.\u201d\nThe efforts to cloak the information in the case have been longstanding.\nSince thecase was filed in October 2020, Google and others have argued that the court should keep financial transactions, business relationships and internal affairs out of public view, driven by a desire to avoid embarrassing disclosures and competitive corporate secrets. Google\u2019s partners like Samsung, andrivals such as DuckDuckGo, have also sought to shield some of their documents and executives\u2019 testimony from the public.\nIn one legal filing, Microsoft asked the court to consult it on confidentiality throughout the trial.\nThe right of public access \u201cis not absolute,\u201d Microsoft wrote to the court. The company added that the disclosure of \u201cits business strategies, internal deliberations and negotiations\u201d would harm it.\nMicrosoft declined to comment.\nThe closed-door nature of the trial was on full display on Thursday when the Justice Department called John Giannandrea, a senior executive at Apple and a former head of search at Google, to testify on the importance of scale for search engines and his guidance on Apple\u2019s search efforts.\nEven before Mr. Giannandrea began answering questions, the Justice Department\u2019s lead litigator, Kenneth Dintzer, said Apple had expressed a strong preference for the testimony to be in closed session on nearly every topic. Then less than 15 minutes after Mr. Giannandrea took the stand, Judge Mehta called an end to the day.\nThe Apple executive returned to the stand on Friday morning, which started in closed session. More than four hours later, Mr. Giannandrea left the courtroom with lawyers for Apple without the proceedings being opened.\nMatt Stoller, the research director of the American Economic Liberties Project, an antimonopoly think tank, said the secrecy \u201cundercuts the legitimacy of our legal system.\u201d His group tried and failed to persuade the court to open a teleconference line for the trial.\nTim Wu, a law professor at Columbia University who worked on antitrust policies in the Biden administration and who has contributed opinion essays to The Times, said government lawyers sometimes agreed to seal information to speed a case along.\n\u201cThese things are warfare,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to get the information, and you don\u2019t internalize the cost to the public or reporters.\u201d\nBut Mr. Wu noted that there was an inherent irony in Google\u2019s push to limit disclosure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic for a company to suck up all our information and know everything about us and we can\u2019t know a damn thing about them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe deserve a better look at them.\u201d\nDavid McCabecontributed reporting."

        "title": "Chinese Warnings on iPhones Tap Deep Strain of Security Concerns",
        "fulltext": "China has discouraged the use of foreign-made electronic devices by government officials for a decade. It has told agencies and state-owned companies to replace American computer servers and other devices with domestic ones. And officials frequently show off to Americans their phones made by Huawei, China\u2019s cellphone giant.\nNow, some employees of government agencies said they have received directives not to use Apple iPhones for work. Internet users in China also have beencirculating accountsandscreenshotssaid to contain notices to government employees and state-owned businesses ordering or urging them to adopt domestic brands of cellphones and computers for their work.\nChinese authorities have issued no public pronouncements about broader restrictions on iPhones. The suggestion that Apple could lose ground in the valuable Chinese market has pushed the company\u2019s stock lower, and Apple\u2019s most popular product has gotten snared in the persistent China-U.S. tensions over technology.\nChina\u2019s censors, usually assiduous about controlling the flow of information on the internet, appear to have done little or nothing to stop the claims of restrictions, first reported inThe Wall Street Journal.\nHu Xijin, the retired editor of a Communist Party-run tabloid and now a nationalistic commentator with 25 million followers, has written about them on his blog. \u201cIf this trend continues, the U.S. is likely to be the bigger loser,\u201dMr. Hu wrote on Weibo, a popular Chinese social media site. In a written reply to questions, Mr. Hu said that China has been forced by American policies to show greater \u201cvigilance\u201d about security issues.\nOn Sunday,President Bidensaid during a news conference in Vietnam that China\u2019s plan to limit government use of \u201ca Western cellphone\u201d was evidence that \u201cChina is beginning to change some of the rules of the game in terms of trade and other issues.\u201d\nSome local and provincial employees, who make up the bulk of government employees in China, have denied being told of any ban. They have been targeted in previous efforts to discourage the use of Apple devices, notably after Edward J. Snowden, an American government contractor, released information in 2013 revealing American surveillance around the world.\nThe United States and China both have much to lose in a geopolitical fight over consumer electronics.\nApple products are more visible in China than products from Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi are in the United States. But because Apple and many other consumer electronics manufacturers have moved much of their manufacturing to China, one of the largest categories of the American trade deficit with China is in smartphones.\nThe warnings come right after Huawei introduced a smartphone with high-quality cameras that is seen as an iPhone rival. The Huawei phone, the Mate 60 Pro, is the target of aU.S. reviewinto whether it uses computer chips that were made with American technologies that have been embargoed for sale to China. Huawei has presented the phone as a domestic effort.\nGina Raimondo, the United States commerce secretary, visited Beijing and Shanghai last month and told Chinese officials that the United States would not pull back recent controls it placed on certain high-tech exports to China.\nDuncan Clark, a specialist in China\u2019s telecom sector and now the chairman of BDA China, an investment consulting firm, said he believed the restrictions were \u201can effort to raise the stakes and remind the U.S. of what it could lose\u201d from continued geopolitical frictions.\nJean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor emeritus at Hong Kong Baptist University, had a similar assessment. \u201cI think it\u2019s a tit-for-tat reaction,\u201d he said, to American efforts to discourage foreign governments from installing Huawei equipment in their telecom sectors, as well as moves by some U.S. states torestrict the use of TikTok, the social media app, by government employees.\nThe United States bans federal agencies from buying telecommunications equipment from Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers.\nMr. Cabestan said that the warnings in China appeared to be a security measure aimed at state employees, and not a broader effort to discourage sales in China of Apple devices.\nStill, few American companies have more to lose than Apple from rising tensions between the world\u2019s superpowers. China is the world\u2019s largest smartphone market and the source of about a fifth of Apple\u2019s revenue. Apple doesn\u2019t break out how many iPhones it sells in China.\nMore broadly, Apple became the most valuable technology company by pioneering a business model built on China\u2019s manufacturing expertise. The country\u2019s giant work force inexpensively assembles the vast majority of iPhones sold around the world.\nOn Tuesday in California, Apple will reveal its newest iPhone at a highly choreographed event that is an annual rite in Silicon Valley, and the company will then start stocking its stores around the world with the new model. Increasing official Chinese resistance to iPhones has the potential to curb this year\u2019s sales.\nApple, which didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment, has not said anything publicly about the recent reports.\nThe iPhone has long been a status symbol among Chinese entrepreneurs and popular among consumers, particularly in cities. By contrast, government employees have made a point of showing off their Huawei phones in public settings.\nUnder pressure from the Chinese government, Apple hasbuilt an extensive data centerin China, although it has said it continues to protect its customers\u2019 privacy all over the world.\nSome people who work in China\u2019s central government said employees have been told to stop using iPhones. Others described a vaguer demand for officials to stop using foreign-brand phones and to use Chinese ones.\nOne message that circulated on WeChat, a ubiquitous Chinese social media service, cited a decision from a departmental leader that staff members were to be barred from using foreign-brand smartphones, laptops and other digital devices starting Sept. 7. The message said staff members were also prohibited from using these foreign-brand products for work in their own homes. Anothermessageon WeChat said that staff members would be required to stop using iPhones by Oct. 1.\nDiscussion hasappeared online for yearsabout whether Chinese officials are barred from using iPhones, along with occasionaldenials of blanket bans. A Shanghainewspaper reported in 2014that officials in that city were under pressure to abandon iPhones over security worries.\nA researcher in a government-run research institute in Beijing, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the drive to discourage the use of iPhones appeared to ripple from whatChinese officialsandparty newspapershave described as a strategy of \u201csubstitution for domestic products\u201d in key technologies, which has picked up pace since last year. In a speech to senior officials in February, which waspublished in July, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, urged increased efforts to achieve self-sufficiency for China in scientific research and advanced technologies.\n\u201cWe must go on the offensive for the national production of scientific and technological instruments and equipment, operating systems and basic software,\u201d Mr. Xi said.\nIn recent weeks, China\u2019s Minister of State Security has publicized cases that it said involved Chinese officials and other people in sensitive roles being recruited by U.S. intelligence agents. Earlier this year, Chinesegovernment secrecy authoritieswarned about careless use of phones that could expose officials to hacking or leaking sensitive information.\nAmy Chang Chien,Claire FuandLi Yuancontributed reporting."

        "title": "The Technology Facebook and Google Didn\u2019t Dare Release",
        "fulltext": "One afternoon in early 2017, at Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., an engineer named Tommer Leyvand sat in a conference room with a smartphone standing on the brim of his baseball cap. Rubber bands helped anchor it in place with the camera facing out. The absurd hat-phone, a particularly uncool version of the future, contained a secret tool known only to a small group of employees. What it could do was remarkable.\nThe handful of men in the room were laughing and speaking over one another in excitement, as captured in a video taken that day, until one of them asked for quiet. The room went silent; the demo was underway.\nMr. Leyvand turned toward a man across the table from him. The smartphone\u2019s camera lens \u2014 round, black, unblinking \u2014 hovered above Mr. Leyvand\u2019s forehead like a Cyclops eye as it took in the face before it. Two seconds later, a robotic female voice declared, \u201cZach Howard.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d confirmed Mr. Howard, a mechanical engineer.\nAn employee who saw the tech demonstration thought it was supposed to be a joke. But when the phone started correctly calling out names, he found it creepy, like something out of a dystopian movie.\nThe person-identifying hat-phone would be a godsend for someone with vision problems or face blindness, but it was risky. Facebook\u2019s previous deployment of facial recognition technology, to help people tag friends in photos, had caused an outcry from privacy advocates and led to a class-action lawsuit in Illinois in 2015 that ultimately cost the company $650 million.\nWith technology like that on Mr. Leyvand\u2019s head, Facebook could prevent users from ever forgetting a colleague\u2019s name, give a reminder at a cocktail party that an acquaintance had kids to ask about or help find someone at a crowded conference. However, six years later, the company now known as Meta has not released a version of that product and Mr. Leyvand has departed for Apple to work on its Vision Pro augmented reality glasses.\nIn recent years, the start-ups Clearview AI and PimEyes have pushed the boundaries of what the public thought was possible by releasing face search engines paired with millions of photos from the public web (PimEyes) or even billions (Clearview). With these tools, available to the police in the case ofClearview AIand the public at large in the case ofPimEyes, a snapshot of someone can be used to find other online photos where that face appears, potentially revealing a name, social media profiles or information a person would never want to be linked to publicly, such as risqu\u00e9 photos.\nWhat these start-ups had done wasn\u2019t a technological breakthrough; it was an ethical one. Tech giants had developed the ability to recognize unknown people\u2019s faces years earlier, but had chosen to hold the technology back, deciding that the most extreme version \u2014 putting a name to a stranger\u2019s face \u2014 was too dangerous to make widely available.\nNow that the taboo has been broken, facial recognition technology could become ubiquitous. Currently used by the police to solve crimes, authoritarian governments to monitor their citizens and businesses to keep outtheir enemies, it may soon be a tool in all our hands, an app on our phone \u2014 or in augmented reality glasses \u2014 that would usher in a world with no strangers.\nAs early as 2011, a Google engineerrevealedhe had been working on a tool to Google someone\u2019s face and bring up other online photos of them. Months later, Google\u2019s chairman, Eric Schmidt, said in an onstage interview that Google \u201cbuilt that technology, and we withheld it.\u201d\n\u201cAs far as I know, it\u2019s the only technology that Google built and, after looking at it, we decided to stop,\u201d Mr. Schmidt said.\nAdvertently or not, the tech giants also helped hold the technology back from general circulation by snapping up the most advanced start-ups that offered it. In 2010, Apple bought a promising Swedish facial recognition company called Polar Rose. In 2011, Google acquired a U.S. face recognition company popular with federal agencies called PittPatt. And in 2012, Facebook purchased the Israeli company Face.com. In each case, the new owners shut down the acquired companies\u2019 services to outsiders. The Silicon Valley heavyweights were the de facto gatekeepers for how and whether the tech would be used.\nFacebook, Google and Apple deployed facial recognition technology in what they considered to be relatively benign ways: as a security tool to unlock a smartphone, a more efficient way to tag known friends in photos and an organizational tool to categorize smartphone photos by the faces of the people in them.\nIn the last few years, though, the gates have been trampled by smaller, more aggressive companies, such as Clearview AI and PimEyes. What allowed the shift was the open-source nature of neural network technology, which now underpins most artificial intelligence software.\nUnderstanding the path of facial recognition technology will help us navigate what is to come with other advancements in A.I., such as image- and text-generation tools. The power to decide what they can and can\u2019t do will increasingly be determined by anyone with a bit of tech savvy, who may not pay heed to what the general public considers acceptable.\nHow did we get to this point where someonecan spot a \u201chot dad\u201don a Manhattan sidewalk and then use PimEyes to try to find out who he is and where he works? The short answer is a combination of free code shared online, a vast array of public photos, academic papers explaining how to put it all together and a cavalier attitude toward laws governing privacy.\nThe Clearview AI co-founder Hoan Ton-That, who led his company\u2019s technological development, had no special background in biometrics. Before Clearview AI, he made Facebook quizzes, iPhone games and silly apps, such as \u201cTrump Hair\u201d to make a person in a photo appear to be coifed like the former president.\nIn his quest to create a groundbreaking and more lucrative app, Mr. Ton-That turned to free online resources, such as OpenFace \u2014 a \u201cface recognition library\u201d created by a group at Carnegie Mellon University. The code library was available on GitHub, with a warning: \u201cPlease use responsibly!\u201d\n\u201cWe do not support the use of this project in applications that violate privacy and security,\u201d readthe statement. \u201cWe are using this to help cognitively impaired users sense and understand the world around them.\u201d\nIt was a noble request but completely unenforceable.\nMr. Ton-That got the OpenFace code up and running, but it wasn\u2019t perfect, so he kept searching, wandering through the academic literature and code repositories, trying out this and that to see what worked. He was like a person walking through an orchard, sampling the fruit of decades of research, ripe for the picking and gloriously free.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it if I had to build it from scratch,\u201d he said, name-dropping some of the researchers who had advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence, including Geoffrey Hinton, \u201cthe godfather of A.I.\u201d \u201cI was standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d\nMr. Ton-That is still building. Clearview has developed a version of its app that works with augmented reality glasses, a more fully formed realization of the face-calling hat that the Facebook engineering team had rigged up years earlier.\nThe $999 pair of augmented reality glasses, made by a company called Vuzix, connects the wearer to Clearview\u2019s database of 30 billion faces. Clearview\u2019s A.R. app, which can identity someone up to 10 feet away, is not yet publicly available, but the Air Force has provided funding forits possible use at military bases.\nOn a fall afternoon, Mr. Ton-That demonstrated the glasses for me at his spokeswoman\u2019s apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, putting them on and looking toward me.\n\u201cOoooh, 176 photos,\u201d he said. \u201cAspen Ideas Festival. Kashmir Hill,\u201d he read from the image caption on one of the photos that came up.\nThen he handed the glasses to me. I put them on. Though they looked clunky, they were lightweight and fit naturally. Mr. Ton-That said he had tried out other augmented reality glasses, but these had performed best. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a new version coming,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ll look cooler, more hipster.\u201d\nWhen I looked at Mr. Ton-That through the glasses, a green circle appeared around his face. I tapped a touch pad at my right temple. A message came up on a square display that only I could see on the right lens of the glasses: \u201cSearching \u2026\u201d\nAnd then the square filled with photos of him, a caption beneath each one. I scrolled through them using the touch pad. I tapped to select one that read \u201cClearview CEO, Hoan Ton-That;\u201d it included a link that showed me that it had come from Clearview\u2019s website.\nI looked at his spokeswoman, searched her face, and 49 photos came up, including one with a client that she asked me not to mention. This casually revealed just how intrusive a search of someone\u2019s face can be, even for a person whose job is to get the world to embrace this technology.\nI wanted to take the glasses outside to see how they worked on people I didn\u2019t actually know, but Mr. Ton-That said we couldn\u2019t, both because the glasses required a Wi-Fi connection and because someone might recognize him and realize immediately what the glasses were and what they could do.\nIt didn\u2019t frighten me, though I knew it should. It was clear that people who own a tool like this will inevitably have power over those who don\u2019t. But there was a certain thrill in seeing it work, like a magic trick successfully performed.\nMeta has been working for years on its own augmented reality glasses. In an internal meeting in early 2021, the company\u2019s chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said he would love to equip them with facial recognition capabilities.\nIn a recording of the internal meeting, Mr. Bosworth said that leaving facial recognition out of augmented reality glasses was a lost opportunity for enhancing human memory. He talked about the universal experience of going to a dinner party and seeing someone you know but failing to recall their name.\n\u201cWe could put a little name tag on them,\u201d he said in the recording, with a short chuckle. \u201cWe could. We have that ability.\u201d\nBut he expressed concern about the legality of offering such a tool.Buzzfeedreported on his remarks at the time. In response, Mr. Bosworthsaidthat face recognition was \u201chugely controversial\u201d and that granting broad access to it was \u201ca debate we need to have with the public.\u201d\nWhile Meta\u2019s augmented reality glasses are stillin development, the company shut down the facial recognition system deployed on Facebook to tag friends in photos and deleted the more thanone billion face printsit had created of its users.\nIt would be easy enough to turn such a system back on. When I asked a Meta spokesman about Mr. Bosworth\u2019s comments and whether the company might put facial recognition into its augmented reality glasses one day, he would not rule out the possibility.\nKashmir Hill covers technology for The New York Times.
