        "title": "How Companies Like Apple Sprinkle Secrets in Earnings Reports",
        "fulltext": "Don\u2019t blame Wall Street analysts, rank-and-file investors and journalists for failing to read corporate earnings reports from beginning to end.\nFor one thing, the quarterly and annual reports churned out by publicly traded companies are forbiddingly long. Microsoft\u2019s most recent annual report, known as a 10-K, was130 pages; Apple\u2019s was96 pages; Amazon\u2019s was89 pages.\nFor another, their prose is often dreary and repetitious. Filled with legal language aimed at satisfying securities regulators without alarming investors and driving down share prices, many earnings reports seem designed to be mind-numbingly boring.\nIt\u2019s the financial figures within these pages that are critically important. Is a company generating profits and cash, is it growing, is it borrowing too much or investing too little? Answers to these questions are often revealed in the numbers, but I\u2019ve always thought it best to avoid spending much time on the words.\nThere is evidence that most other people have made the same judgment, yet it turns out that we\u2019ve been making a mistake. The turgid language in these dull corporate reports is actually sprinkled with important clues about major problems \u2014 and there is a way to get an inkling about them without actually having to read every word.\nThose are the main insights of\u201cLazy Prices,\u201da fascinating research paper featured in the November issue of TheNBER Digest, a publication of the National Bureau of Economic Research. It found that corporate reports are, indeed, repetitious, but when the language in the current text varies a great deal from previous versions, it frequently signals trouble that will become evident several months later.\nThree economists \u2014Lauren CohenandChristopher Malloyof the Harvard Business School, andQuoc Nguyenof DePaul University \u2014 downloaded every quarterly and annual corporate report of every publicly traded American company from 1995 to 2014.\nThey then sifted through thousands of reports, using a text analysis program. \u201cWe filtered out the reports that made a lot of wording changes over the previous year\u2019s version,\u201d Mr. Cohen said in an interview. \u201cIt turned out that when there are a lot of changes, there\u2019s a good chance that something important is going on, and most of the time, it\u2019s negative.\u201d\nAmong the reports that included many such changes, the researchers found a high probability that the companies\u2019 share prices would decline several months after the reports appeared.\nTextual changes in the \u201crisk factors\u201d section were most likely to predict subsequent moves in share prices. (Corporate earnings reports are rigidly formatted to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements and are divided into predictable sections.) When the researchers refined the analysis further, differentiating between textual changes that were positive and negative, the results were even more striking.\nThe overwhelming majority \u2014 86 percent \u2014 of reports with substantial wording changes were primarily negative in tone. But the minority that contained primarily positive language generally correlated with increases in share prices later.\nThat brings up another important point: The stock market rarely responded to the subtle hints in the reports immediately. In fact, it typically took several months for whatever good or bad news was embedded in the reports to be widely understood \u2014 and to move the stock market.\nThis delay means that there is a profit opportunity for those able to exploit it, the researchers said.\nWhen they constructed a hypothetical portfolio that shorted \u2014 or bet against \u2014 the companies with primarily negative word changes in the reports, while buying shares of the companies with positive changes, the portfolio outperformed the stock market by 22 percentage points per year.\nWhat is perhaps most remarkable is that they selected these investments without actually reading any of the reports or analyzing the stocks or the companies.\n\u201cChanges to the 10-Ks predict future earnings, profitability, future news announcements, and even future firm-level bankruptcies,\u201d the researchers said. That was the case even when the corporate reports contained no outright announcements about such matters.\nAs a result, they said: \u201cWe find no announcement effect associated with these changes \u2014 with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news, events, or earnings \u2014 suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms.\u201d\nInvestors are apparently still being inattentive. An excellent\u201cHeard on The Street\u201dcolumn in The Wall Street Journal in June 2017 by Justin Lahart reported on an earlier version of the \u201cLazy Prices\u201d findings. In that column, Mr. Lahart said explicitly that investors might profit by following the researchers\u2019 methods. And in August, the open-sourceQuantopianinvesting site created an algorithm replicating the researchers\u2019 methods, and found that the results remained robust: A new model portfolio outperformed the market.\nIn other words, word changes in corporate reports still appear to be signaling subsequent changes in stock prices and few, if any people, have noticed. That suggests that scarcely anyone has been reading corporate reports thoroughly \u2014 and that scarcely anyone has read the \u201cLazy Prices\u201d paper, either.\nTo be fair, the clues unearthed by the researchers\u2019 approach are fuzzy and imprecise at best.\nIn November, for example, I asked Professor Cohen how I might make practical use of his insights.\nHe suggested two things: \u201cFirst, always download the previous version of a corporate report as well as the current version, so you can compare the language. Focus on the differences from year to year. Second, focus on one section, the \u2018risk factors section.\u2019\u201d\nI did just that, looking mainly at the latest Apple corporate report,postedon its website on Nov. 5. There was plenty of new language describing the risks that Apple faced \u2014 risks that Apple executives discussed in November and disclosed more directly in aletter to shareholderson Jan. 2.\nThese risks included the possibility of an economic slowdown in a place like China, the possibility of slowing iPhone sales, the threat of a trade war and the potential impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. All of these risks have actually materialized and Apple shares have sunk, pulling down the overall stock market.\nBut based on the language changes in the corporate report alone, was there a specific reason for investors to bid down Apple stock, or for a journalist to conclude that Apple was in serious trouble?\nI didn\u2019t think so at the time, and I still don\u2019t. The linguistic clues were another piece of evidence that needed to be evaluated and, perhaps, bolstered, by other research.\nClues like that have real value, though. The \u201cLazy Prices\u201d research will, at the very least, lead me to read these reports a little differently, in the hope of using them to unearth deeper truths. What\u2019s more, until the \u201cLazy Prices\u201d research is widely understood, it may be possible for some investors to profit from it."

        "title": "Steve Jobs Never Wanted Us to Use Our iPhones Like This",
        "fulltext": "Smartphones are our constant companions. For many of us, their glowing screens are a ubiquitous presence, drawing us in with endless diversions, like the warm ping of social approval delivered in the forms of likes and retweets, and the algorithmically amplified outrage of the latest \u201cbreaking\u201d news or controversy. They\u2019re in our hands, as soon as we wake, and command our attention until the final moments before we fall asleep.\nSteve Jobs would not approve.\nIn 2007, Mr. Jobs took the stage at the Moscone Convention Center in San Francisco and introduced the world to the iPhone. If youwatch the full speech, you\u2019ll be surprised by how he imagined our relationship with this iconic invention, because this vision is so different from the way most of us use these devices now.\nIn the remarks, after discussing the phone\u2019s interface and hardware, he spends an extended amount of time demonstrating how the device leverages the touch screen before detailing the many ways Apple engineers improved the age-old process of making phone calls. \u201cIt\u2019s the best iPod we\u2019ve ever made,\u201d Mr. Jobs exclaims at one point. \u201cThe killer app is making calls,\u201d he later adds. Both lines spark thunderous applause. He doesn\u2019t dedicate any significant time to discussing the phone\u2019s internet connectivity features until more than 30 minutes into the address.\nThe presentation confirms that Mr. Jobs envisioned a simpler and more constrained iPhone experience than the one we actually have over a decade later. For example, he doesn\u2019t focus much on apps. When the iPhone was first introduced there was no App Store, and this was by design. As Andy Grignon, an original member of the iPhone team, told me when I was researching this topic, Mr. Jobs didn\u2019t trust third-party developers to offer the same level of aesthetically pleasing and stable experiences that Apple programmers could produce. He was convinced that the phone\u2019s carefully designed native features were enough. It was \u201can iPod that made phone calls,\u201d Mr. Grignon said to me.\nMr. Jobs seemed to understand the iPhone as something that would help us with a small number of activities \u2014 listening to music, placing calls, generating directions. He didn\u2019t seek to radically change the rhythm of users\u2019 daily lives. He simply wanted to take experiences we already found important and make them better.\nThe minimalist vision for the iPhone he offered in 2007 is unrecognizable today \u2014 and that\u2019s a shame.\nUnder what I call the \u201cconstant companion model,\u201d we now see our smartphones as always-on portals to information. Instead of improving activities that we found important before this technology existed, this model changes what we pay attention to in the first place \u2014 often in ways designed to benefit the stock price of attention-economy conglomerates, not our satisfaction and well-being.\nWe\u2019ve become so used to the constant companionmodel over the past decade that it\u2019s easy to forget its novelty. As a computer scientist who also writes about the impact of technology on culture, I think it\u2019s important to highlight the magnitude of this shift, as it seems increasingly clear to me that Mr. Jobs probably got it right the first time: Many of us would be better off returning to his original minimalist vision for our phones.\nPractically speaking, to be a minimalist smartphone user means that you deploy this device for a small number of features that do things you value (and that the phone does particularly well), and then outside of these activities, put it away. This approach dethrones this gadget from a position of constant companion down to a luxury object, like a fancy bike or a high-end blender, that gives you great pleasure when you use it but doesn\u2019t dominate your entire day.\nTo succeed with this approach, a useful first step is to remove from your smartphone any apps that make money from your attention. This includes social media, addictive games and newsfeeds that clutter your screen with \u201cbreaking\u201d notifications. Unless you\u2019re a cable news producer, you don\u2019t need minute-by-minute updates on world events, and your friendships are likely to survive even if you have to wait until you\u2019re sitting at your home computer to log on to Facebook or Instagram. In addition, by eliminating your ability to publish carefully curated images to social media directly from your phone, you can simply be present in a nice moment, free from the obsessive urge to document it.\nTurning our attention to professional activities, if your work doesn\u2019t absolutely demand that you be accessible by email when away from your desk, delete the Gmail app or disconnect the built-in email client from your office servers. It\u2019s occasionally convenient to check in when out and about, but this occasional convenience almost always comes at the cost of developing a compulsive urge to monitor your messages constantly. If you\u2019re not sure whether your work requires phone-based email, don\u2019t ask; just delete the apps and wait to see whether it causes a problem \u2014 many people unintentionally exaggerate their need to constantly be available.\nOnce you\u2019ve stripped away the digital chatter clamoring for your attention, your smartphone will return to something closer to the role originally conceived by Mr. Jobs. It will become a well-designed object that comes out occasionally throughout your day to support \u2014 not subvert \u2014 your efforts to live well: It helps you find that perfect song to listen to while walking across town on a sunny fall afternoon; it loads up directions to the restaurant where you\u2019re meeting a good friend; with just a few swipes, it allows you to place a call to your mom \u2014 and then it can go back into your pocket, or your bag, or the hall table by your front door, while you move on with the business of living your real-world life.\nEarly in his 2007 keynote, Mr. Jobs said, \u201cToday, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.\u201d What he didn\u2019t add, however, was the follow-up promise that \u201ctomorrow, we\u2019re going to reinvent your life.\u201d The iPhone is a fantastic phone, but it was never meant to be the foundation for a new form of existence in which the digital increasingly encroaches on the analog. If you return this innovation to its original limited role, you\u2019ll get more out of both your phone and your life.\nCal Newport is an associate professor of computer science at Georgetown and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cDigital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World.\u201d\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram.Body"

        "fulltext": "If anything,MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It\u2019s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed \u2014 the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue ofEmber magazineand, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. \u201cLet\u2019s be buds\u201d urges a sign on one table.\nIt certainly looks like it\u2019s going great at this chain of weed dispensaries. But \u2014 like a lot of businesses around thenewly commercialized marijuana industryin California \u2014 MedMen is struggling.The latest quarterof this publicly traded company showed a net loss of $66 million on revenues of $21.5 million. It had lost $79 million the previous quarter.\nNot enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMen\u2019s problems, but the disconnect between the company\u2019s promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week:Apple\u2019s announcementthat it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter.\n[Kara Swisheranswered your questionsabout this column on Twitter.]\nApple has hung the moon for investorsfor so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes. It is, to use an old California trope, going to be a real bummer for Silicon Valley.\nNow stick with me here, because what\u2019s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?\nApple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook. He, of course, was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs, who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in 1997. Since then, it has been all uphill, to the point this summer when Apple reached a$1 trillion valuation\u2014 the first publicly traded American company to reach that high \u2014 with a price of $207.39 a share.\nToday it\u2019s trading at $142.64, and analysts are predicting it will settle around $135.Yipes. Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China, where Apple products are popular, and the Trump administration\u2019s trade war.\nBut asIna Fried of Axiosnoted: \u201cThe problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple. But Apple\u2019s iPhone problems extend far beyond China, too.\u201d\nIndeed. The last big innovation explosion \u2014 the proliferation of the smartphone \u2014 is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a \u201cCambrian explosion,\u201d a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify.\nNow all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.\nApple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.\nThat business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don\u2019t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it\u2019s apparent that it\u2019s now winding down.\nThis is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward. The last cool set of companies \u2014 Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and, yes, Tinder \u2014 were created many years ago, and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising.\nWell, rental scooters. O.K., they\u2019re cool, but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now. How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.\nWhere is that next spark that will light us all up?\nFollow The New York Times Opinion section onFacebook,Twitter (@NYTopinion)andInstagram, and sign up for theOpinion Today newsletter."

        "title": "How to Save on Your Next Apple Purchase",
        "fulltext": "Gadgets like Apple\u2019s iPhone have becomeso powerful and durablethat you can wait many years before buying a new one. The bad news is that your next upgrade will probably cost a lot more.\nConsider that last year, Apple raised prices for most of its products. They includedits iPhones, Apple Watch, Mac Mini, MacBook Air and iPad Pro. (Yes, that is nearly the company\u2019s entire gadget lineup.) Apple has said the increases were necessary because the products had become more complex and expensive to make.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, defended the iPhone\u2019s rising pricesin an interviewwith \u201cGood Morning America\u201din September. He said the iPhone was an all-in-one gadget replacing cameras and music players, among other gizmos.\n\u201cWe found that people want to have the most innovative product available, and with that, it\u2019s not cheap to do that,\u201d he said.\nThat justification did not add up for me. Since the iPhone\u2019s debut in 2007, it had been a multifunctional device that continually incorporated cutting-edge features without significant price increases. The same went for Apple\u2019s watches, computers and tablets: They became more advanced over the years without big price jumps \u2014 until now.\nAnd there is a question of whether Apple has pushed prices up too high. On Tuesday, the company \u2014 while dealing with reports about anembarrassing privacy glitchthat let iPhone users eavesdrop on one another\u2019s microphones \u2014 reporteddisappointing financial results. In a letter warning investors before the quarterly earnings report, Appleacknowledgedthat iPhone sales may have slowed because of factors including higher prices.\nFor a reality check on Apple\u2019s pricing, I spoke to financial experts and pricing strategists. I learned that there is credence to Apple\u2019s arguments: Its products do cost more to produce than in years past. But that didn\u2019t stop me from consulting withWirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews products and tracks deals, for advice on how we could shave the costs of our next Apple upgrades.\nHere\u2019s what I found.\nLast year, Apple\u2019s prices shot up by 7 percent to 60 percent, depending on the product. Perhaps the most notable increase was for the new Mac Mini, which costs about $800, up from $500. (The last Mac Mini debuted in 2014.)\nSome Apple prices stayed firm or declined. Notably, the newer entry-level iPad is selling for about $330, down from $500 in years past.\nBut in general, prices jumped. That was surprising given that product costs typically fall as technologies mature and parts become widely available, which was what happened with televisions.\nThe more I examined the pricing, though, the more evidence there was that the latest Apple products are more expensive to make. Apple also appears to be under pressure to introduce more complex innovations to compete in the brutal technology market.\nTake a look at the company\u2019s gross profit margin, or the money it makes from products after the cost to make and sell them is factored in. If Apple\u2019s gross margins are lower today even though prices are higher, that indicates the products cost more to make.\nAnd that is indeed the case. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein who has studied Apple for years, estimated that the company\u2019s gross margins for the iPhone were below 40 percent, down frommore than 50 percentseveral years ago.\nMr. Sacconaghi said the shrinking margins demonstrated how tough it had become to compete in the technology market. Apple has had to add features like stronger metals, sophisticated cameras, high-resolution displays, advanced chips and faster wireless connectivity while trimming back on some profit given that rival products fromthe likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovohave become very capable. If Apple had wanted to keep profit margins consistent with past years, he said, it would have had to raise prices even higher and risk losing sales.\n\u201cYou have to put in more to stay competitive, or you\u2019re going to lose share,\u201d he said.\nJared Wiesel, a partner at Revenue Analytics, a pricing and sales consulting firm, said Apple was still in a unique position to introduce broad price increases. Other companies, such as grocery brands, lack the clout to do so because their competitors might undercut them and lure away customers.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the very enviable position that they can, by and large, take major action across the board without, so far, seeing a major erosion of loyalty as a result,\u201d Mr. Wiesel said.\nAn Apple spokeswoman referred to Mr. Cook\u2019s comments on Tuesday\u2019s earnings call. In response to a question about whether Apple had raised prices too high, Mr. Cook said the prices were not that much more. He noted that the iPhone XS was the same price as last year's iPhone X, and that the XR was priced only slightly higher than the iPhone 8.\nDiscounts for new Apple products are rare. But here are several methods to lower the cost of your next purchase.\nOne simple way to get some cash toward your next purchase is to take your old devices to a trade-in program at a retailer or a wireless store. Apple runs AppleGiveBack, which gives you Apple Store credit in exchange for an old phone, tablet, computer or smart watch.Gazelle, an online reseller, will let you sell smartphones, tablets and Macs in exchange for cash or Amazon store credit. Carriers likeAT&TandVerizon Wirelessoffer trade-in programs. AndBest Buy storesalso provide store credit for many used devices.\nThe best part about the release of a new Apple product is that last year\u2019s model can be had for cheaper. Apple now sells the iPhone 8, still a very good phone, for about $600, down from its original $700 price.\nOlder-generation Apple Watches and tablets occasionally go on sale during holiday shopping periods such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Wirecutter said. In November, theApple Watch Series 3 dropped to $200on Amazon, down from the original $330.\nTo scout for deals, you can create alerts for price drops using web tools likeCamel Camel Camel. Wirecutter also runs awebpage that regularly highlights deals.\nApple product discounts tend to be better when you buy through third parties like Best Buy and Amazon.\n\u201cThe best tip is to shop around before going to the Apple Store,\u201d said Alex Roth, a commerce editor for Wirecutter.\nTrusted brands like Apple, Best Buy and Amazon offer programs to buy refurbished or used products.\nRefurbished products typically were returned by a consumer and then restored to excellent condition, and they often include a fresh battery and warranty. Apple\u2019s online store forrefurbished productslists last year\u2019s iPad Pro for about $550, down from about $650.\nBuying usedApple gadgets can often yield more savings, but you will have to be judicious about whom you buy from. Your best bet is to buy from a friend, a relative or a reseller that is a trusted brand. I have had consistently good experiences buying used products from Amazon\u2019sWarehouse program, for example.\nOf course, you can save $750 on the next $750 iPhone by not buying it at all. The most thrifty thing you can do is tomaintain your deviceand skip upgrading.\nPlenty of Apple customers have caught on to this approach. The company acknowledged in its recent note to investors that many iPhone customers took advantage of its battery replacement program, which may have contributed to slower sales of replacements.\nThere\u2019s a hidden benefit to giving your devices some tender loving care.\n\u201cTake good care of the one you have so that when the time comes for an upgrade, you can trade that one in and you\u2019ll get something for it,\u201d Mr. Roth said."

Late Wednesday it reduced its revenue forecast for its most recent quarter because of a significant slowdown in iPhone sales in China.\nApple\u2019s stock fell 10 percent on Thursday, its worst one-day slide in six years.

Qorvo, a maker of radio frequency chips, and Cirrus Logic, which supplies audio chips for the iPhone, dropped 9 percent.\nLumentum, which supplies optical components for the iPhone, slid 8 percent.

Even before Apple\u2019s warning \u2014 its first in 16 years \u2014 investors had started to grow worried about the company\u2019s ability to sell more phones.\nThat\u2019s partly because Qorvo, Cirrus Logic, Lumentum and AMS had all already cut their revenue forecasts for the most recent quarter late last year.

        "title": "Apple Cuts Revenue Forecast Because of Slow iPhone Sales in China",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014Applereduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years on Wednesday because of poor iPhone sales in China, an unexpected development that underscored the slowing ofChina\u2019seconomy and raised fears of further turmoil in global markets.\nApple\u2019s surprise announcement was the clearest confirmation yet thatthe Chinese economy is in serious trouble. Beijing\u2019s effort last spring to clamp down on credit, which sparked a slowdown, and an intensifying trade war with the United States have unnerved consumers and businesspeople alike.\n\u201cApple is a bellwether,\u201d said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cThe iPhone is something that everyone knows and buys, and if people aren\u2019t buying it, then that\u2019s a pretty good sign they\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d\nIt is not clear whether this is a problem particular to Apple or whether China\u2019s slowing economy will affect other American companies, especially the tech giants and Detroit automakers. Either way, investors are bound to grow nervous, especially after the stock market\u2019s recent gyrations. Tech stocks, which drove much of the bull market of the past few years, have become a drag on it.\nWith more than 40 stores and hundreds of millions of iPhones sold in the country, few American companies have been as successful as Apple in China \u2014 or have as much to lose. China is Apple\u2019s third-largest market, with nearly $52 billion in sales in the company\u2019s most recent fiscal year, mostly from iPhone sales.\nThe company said it expected revenue of about $84 billion in the quarter that ended Saturday, down from a previous estimate of $89 billion to $93 billion. That would be a nearly 5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said the sales decline in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan would exceed the $4.3 billion overall drop in revenue.\n\u201cWhile we anticipated some challenges in key emerging markets, we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in greater China,\u201d Mr. Cook said in a letter to investors. \u201cWe believe the economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201d\nApple\u2019s revenue warnings sent its shares down more than 7 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday evening, dropping its market value to less than $700 billion. Apple had become the first company tosurpass a $1 trillion valuationin August.\nIts declining share pricehad a ripple effect. Asian markets fell Thursday, and Wall Street opened lower. Apple\u2019s shares dropped by more than 9 percent to start trading Thursday.\n[See how investors reacted to Apple\u2019s news.]\nMr. Cook has for yearsnavigated the difficult politics of China, including its tightening controls over the internet, but the Trump administration\u2019s tougher stance on the country is posing a challenge.\nThe iPhone was exempt from the first round of tariffs on products built in China. But Mr. Cook said Wednesday that trade tensions and accompanying volatility in global markets had weighed on Chinese consumers and Apple\u2019s profits.\nThe company\u2019s other revenue sources, including iPad, Mac and software sales, together increased nearly 19 percent in the quarter. In the United States and other developed markets like Germany and South Korea, Apple said, it actually had record revenues. The company recently said it would end a longtime custom and no longer break out unit sales of iPhones, a change that rattled investors.\nWhile Apple posted roughly flat global sales growth of the iPhone in the third quarter, Chinese rival Huawei jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the market research firm Counterpoint. The figures helped Huawei maintain its status as the second-largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung, which posted a 13 percent fall in sales in the same quarter.\nHuawei has grown despite the China slowdown, as the company has looked to other markets. In the third quarter, its sales rose 13 percent in China but 60 percent outside the country.\nFinding signs of nervousness about spending in China is not hard, especially among the high-end consumers who dominate the purchase of Apple\u2019s costly phones and laptops, which are far more expensive than local brands.\nMany expensive restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai seemed almost empty in early December. Room rates at five-star hotels in both cities, which oscillate continuously in internet pricing these days based on demand, suddenly tumbled in early December, and executive lounges emptied.\nCar sales fell in September, October and November by record percentages from a year earlier, with each month worse than the last. Car executives say early information shows December was a terrible month for sales as well. Automakers like General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen all rely heavily on the Chinese market and have reported nose-dives in their sales in recent months.\nUnsold apartments are clogging thecountry\u2019s real estate market and eroding prices. That is a big threat to China\u2019s economic growth in the new year because the frenzied construction and outfitting of new homes has accounted for a quarter or more of economic output in recent years, outshining even exports.\nThere are broader signs of economic worry. Government and private surveys that were released in the past week show that purchasing managers in China expect the economy to worsen considerably. New orders are down, and exports are faltering.\n\u201cThe worst is yet to come,\u201d Mizuho Securities said in a research report on Monday.\nThe Beijing leadership has not tried to fan anti-American sentiment in the trade war with the Trump administration. Indeed, ever since President Xi Jinping of China reached a temporary truce with President Trump on Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, Chinese state media has gone out of its way to avoid criticizing the United States.\nBut tensions continue to grow. Canada\u2019s recent detention of the chief financial officer of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, on an American warrant has led to fears of retaliation against American companies or executives. Ms. Meng is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder.\nThe Trump administration has so far avoided imposing tariffs on smartphones from China. But if that happens, Apple, with its almost complete dependence on factories in mainland China, could find itself at a disadvantage to its global archrival, Samsung, which makes its phones in a wider variety of countries.\n\u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying iPhones, they\u2019re probably not buying everything else,\u201d Mr. Zandi said. \u201cIt symbolizes how deep China\u2019s economic problems are, and we can connect the dots right back to the trade war.\u201d"

        "title": "Netflix Is Raising Prices. Here\u2019s Why.",
        "fulltext": "Netflix is raising prices.\nGiven how much it has been spending on content, the move isn\u2019t surprising, but the latest jump \u2014 anywhere from 13 to 18 percent depending on the subscription plan \u2014 is the biggest increase since Netflix started its streaming service a dozen years ago. That\u2019s going to hurt some consumers.\nMany of its users pay for the service even if they don\u2019t consistently watch its content, partly because of its attractive pricing. A bare-bones subscription, for instance, had cost $8 a month. But fee increases at Netflix are inevitable. One of reasons:Netflix burns a lot of cash.\nThe company\u2019s appetite for content means it has to spend big, resulting in what\u2019s known as negative free cash flow. More money is going out the door than coming in, a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more.\n\u201cWe change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment and improving the overall Netflix experience,\u201d the company said in a statement announcing the changes, which apply just to United States customers.\nNetflix\u2019s most popular plan, which gives a customer two simultaneous streams, will get the largest increase, to $13 a month from $11. Still, it\u2019s cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service costs about $15 a month. The $8 a month plan will now cost $9, and the high-end version, which allows for four simultaneous streams, jumps to $16 from $14. (The new prices took effect Tuesday for new subscribers. For existing customers, the increases will start in about three months.)\nNetflix, which will report quarterly earnings on Thursday, has committed to spending over $18.6 billion on content. That\u2019s for shows and films that won\u2019t appear on the service for months, whether it\u2019s the next season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d or the forthcoming lineup from the super producerShonda Rhimes.\nIt also includes content that\u2019s currently playing, like \u201cFriends,\u201d which ran on NBC from 1994 through 2004 and is owned by AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia. The show is wildly popular on the service. Worries that it would leave Netflix prompted an outcry on social media. \u201cThe only reason I have an account with Netflix is to rewatch \u2018Friends,\u2019\u201d one customer said.\nThat helps to explain why Netflix agreed to pay AT&Tapproximately $100 millionto keep the show through this year, a threefold increase from what it had been paying on average.\nOriginal shows owned by Netflix are also expensive. \u201cStranger Things,\u201d whose new season will become available this summer, costs as much as $8 million per episode. Netflix has to pay for all of that up front.\nMultiply that by the hundreds of hours of original content that Netflix produces every year, and the cash starts to bleed out. The company had negative free cash flow of $2 billion last year. It expects that figure to rise to about $3 billion this year and about the same next year. That has added to the company\u2019s debt: up to $12 billion before it proposed borrowing another $2 billion in October through a bond offering.\nSpending big on content while keeping prices modest has helped Netflix expand its customer base, about 58 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide. Those figures will be updated Thursday as part of its earnings report.\nBut Netflix technically isn\u2019t losing any money. In fact, it claims a profit every quarter since accounting rules allow entertainment companies to record most of their production or licensing costs later on.\nThe stakes for owning content have risen. Big-pocketed players like the Walt Disney Company, AT&T and NBCUniversal plan to compete with Netflix with streaming services of their own. BothDisneyand AT&T\u2019sWarnerMediaplan to unveil their products by the end of the year, andNBCUniversal, owned by Comcast, is working on an ad-supported model streaming service that it plans to make available in early 2020.\nNot to be left out, Amazon offers a streaming service as part of its Prime shipping program for $13 a month, or $120 a year. Hulu sells an ad-free service for $12 per month. (Disney will take control of Hulu once it completes its acquisition of the bulk of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox business, sometime around the middle of the year.)\nThere is also Apple, which has spent well over $1 billion to create original TV shows. The boom in streaming has increased costs throughout Hollywood, where competition for talent and property has intensified.\nAs Netflix\u2019s chief executive, Reed Hastings, said in October: \u201cThere\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The iPhone as an eavesdropping device? Watch out. It can happen.\nOn Monday, Twitter and other social networking sites lit up with anxious Apple users after the news site9to5Mac reported on a strange glitchin the company\u2019s iPhones. The issue: It turns out that an iPhone user can call another iPhone user and listen in on that person\u2019s conversations through the device\u2019s microphone \u2014 even if the recipient does not answer the call.\nThe problem was the result of a bug and involves Apple\u2019s FaceTime app for placing video and audio calls over an internet connection. The bug could also give a caller access to a live feed of the recipient\u2019s camera.\nOn Monday night, Apple said it had disabled Group FaceTime, the feature that was causing the glitch.\nThe glitch is embarrassing for Apple, which is set toreport disappointing financial earnings on Tuesday. The Silicon Valley company has long positioned itself as a protector of user privacy offering more secure devices than its rivals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re aware of this issue and we have identified a fix that will be released in a software update later this week,\u201d Apple said in a statement.\nThe glitch has already spurred warnings from officials. In a statement issued late Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York urged FaceTime users to temporarily disable the app.\n[Read how todisable FaceTime.]\n\u201cThe FaceTime bug is an egregious breach of privacy that puts New Yorkers at risk,\u201d he said.\nI replicated the bug using two iPhones. I began by placing a FaceTime call to the other iPhone, and while the call was ringing, I swiped up on the screen, hit add person and added myself to the conversation. From there, I was able to listen in on the recipient\u2019s microphone, even if the person did not pick up.\n[Read aboutthe tiny screw that illustrates why Apple probably won\u2019t be assembling iPhonesin the United States.]\nIf the recipient hit the volume-down or volume-up buttons during this process, the caller could also see a live video feed of the recipient\u2019s front-facing iPhone camera.\nHow to handle this? Until the fix is released, iPhone users should go into the phone\u2019s settings and disable FaceTime. Start by opening the Settings app, then tap FaceTime and toggle off FaceTime."

        "title": "Last Month, Investors Seemed Too Pessimistic. Now, They Seem Prescient.",
        "fulltext": "Maybe the markets were not overreacting.\nWith the United States economy posting solid numbers last year, the alarming signals coming out of stock and bond markets seemed out of whack with the real world. President Trump\u2019s bellicose trade actions were a concern, but hiring was strong and corporate earnings were surging.\nBut this week, companies have issued warnings about the health of their businesses that suggest investors were right to be worried about growth. On Wednesday,Applereduced its revenue expectationsfor the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China. On Thursday, Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, while growing, would fall short of the company\u2019s earlier forecast. And the American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released Thursday.\nIn the coming weeks, scores of companies will report their fourth-quarter results. A senior White House economics official acknowledged that there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just Apple,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThere are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.\u201d\nHe seemed to suggest that was not necessarily bad, because it could help the Trump administration achieve its goal of getting China to make trade concessions to the United States.\nThose comments did little to assuage the fears of investors. The S&P 500 stock index closed down about 2.5 percent, leaving it more than 16 percent below the high it hit in September. But perhaps the most notable move was in the market for government bonds, where investors park their money in times of stress or when they expect the economy to slow. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, fell to 2.56 percent, well below the level it reached in early November, when investors were more optimistic about the economy.\n\u201cOn days like today people say, \u2018Crud, I\u2019ve got to buy tons of bonds,\u2019\u201d said Jim Vogel, a fixed income strategist at FTN Financial. \u201cThat\u2019s driven by a large change in sentiment.\u201d\nImportant indicators still show the American economy is growing at a decent clip. A measure of employment in the private sector in December, released Thursday, was higher than expected. And ahead of the Labor Department\u2019s monthly jobs report on Friday, analysts estimated that employers added about 180,000 jobs in December.\nDespite this, companies and consumers are facing challenges that could make them more cautious about spending money. If they pull back, the economy will suffer. Apple\u2019s warning provides strong evidence that the trade tensions with China are taking a toll. And if more indicators show the American economy stumbling, investors will become more convinced that the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent interest rate increases are dampening activity.\nCorporate profits \u2014 and stock prices \u2014 are highly sensitive to global economic weakness. Foreign sales accounted for 45 percent of the revenues of companies in the S&P 500 stock index over the last five years.\nThere are signs of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies beginning to weigh on domestic demand, too. The Institute for Supply Management said Thursday that its index of manufacturing activity fell sharply in December, the largest one-month drop since the last recession.\nThe manufacturing index fell to what is still considered a healthy level, consistent with other data generally showing that the economy remains in good shape. But the downward trend contributed to a growing sense of unease on Wall Street about how soon the current expansion might end.\n\u201cWhen it has seeped into the survey it probably means it\u2019s three to five weeks old,\u201d Mr. Vogel said.\nIndeed, investors are so convinced trouble is coming that they are betting the Federal Reserve will abandon its plans to raise interest rates in 2019.\nFed officials predicted in mid-December that the central bank would raise its benchmark rate twice this year, moving the rate into a \u201cneutral\u201d range that neither stimulates nor discourages economic activity. By the end of trading Thursday, the odds of an interest-rate cut in 2019 had climbed above 50 percent.\nRobert Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reinforced those expectations, telling Bloomberg Television that the Fed should wait at least a few months before considering any additional increases.\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be taking any further action until some of these uncertainties resolve themselves, and I think that could take several months,\u201d he said on Thursday.\nMr. Kaplan, however, is not a voting member of the Fed\u2019s policymaking committee this year. The committee comprises the Fed\u2019s board of governors and a rotating selection of five of the 12 presidents of regional reserve banks.\nAn indication of the Fed\u2019s views could come Friday morning, when the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a public appearance with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a belief he\u2019s willing to back off, but we haven\u2019t seen that yet,\u201d Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, said, referring to Mr. Powell. \u201cIf the Fed hikes rates in March, it\u2019ll be a mess.\u201d\nAnd on Thursday an ominous event occurred in the government bond market. The yield on the 5-year Treasury note fell below that of the 3-month Treasury bill. Yields are generally higher on longer-term debt. An inversion of that pattern signals a loss of confidence in longer-term economic prospects and has often served as an early warning of a recession.\nInvestors and corporate executives have experience with slowdowns in large overseas economies, but they have not had to simultaneously grapple with the effects of a trade war. In explaining Apple\u2019s lowered sales forecast,the company\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, said, \u201cThe economic environment in China has been further impacted by rising trade tensions with the United States.\u201d Apple\u2019s stock plunged nearly 10 percent on Thursday, taking its market value down to around $675 billion, well below the $1.1 trillion it reached as recently as October.\nMr. Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised prices on a wide range of Chinese components used by American manufacturers. Roughly half of the companies in the I.S.M. survey said tariffs were weighing on profits, or raising costs.\nLinton Crystal Technologies, a firm based in Rochester, makes specialized furnaces used to grow silicon tubes, which are cut into wafers for semiconductors and solar panels that are sold to customers all over the world. The work was once performed entirely in the United States. But even though they are still designed, assembled and customized in the United States, the machines\u2019 components now are built in China.\nMr. Trump has said the goal of his trade policies was to convince companies like Linton to bring back jobs from China. Mr. Hassett emphasized on Thursday that the Trump administration expected the domestic economy to remain strong, and that companies focused on the United States would benefit.\nBut Todd Barnum, Linton Crystal\u2019s chief operating officer, said the cost of making furnaces entirely in the United States was prohibitive. And as a result of the tariffs, the company is also moving design work to China \u2014 a move Mr. Barnum said would save hundreds of thousands of dollars in tariffs by reducing the need for prototypes to be shipped to the United States.\n\u201cOur customers don\u2019t care if it was manufactured in the United States,\u201d Mr. Barnum said. \u201cThey care about the highest quality at the lowest dollar.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled.\nLawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech, for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius, has too much power. Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is nowaccused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have beenpummeledfrom their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.\nIn the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash \u2014 Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank \u2014 to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.\nThat is not the path the companies are taking.\n\u201cThe tech companies are not flinching,\u201d said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. \u201cNothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They\u2019re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.\u201d\nThere is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud \u2014 to become, in essence, the internet\u2019s landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 toreimagine a chunk of waterfront Torontofrom the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.\nThese changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home hasan Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will bedriverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.\nTo accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn\u2019t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.\nBig Tech\u2019s push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, withGoogle bulking up in the firstandAmazon planning satellite officesin both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.\nAnyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documentsreviewed by The Mercury News.\nMultiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company\u2019stotal employment in 2009.\nBut Diridon Station is just a part of Google\u2019s Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif.,for $70 million.\nFacebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet ina San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.\nIn total, Google\u2019s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook\u2019s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.\nAmazon\u2019s head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and theacquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people \u2014 and that is not counting its contractors.\nThe expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.\n\u201cFor all intents and purposes, we\u2019re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,\u201d said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. \u201cThe image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.\u201d\nThat\u2019s evident in how robust Big Tech\u2019s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.\nEMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google\u2019s digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipientis Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.\nThe contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.\nApple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone \u2014 up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.\n\u201cMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nBig Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.\n\u201cThe government doesn\u2019t have a good clue,\u201d said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. \u201cThey\u2019re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.\u201d\nWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.\n\u201cFor Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,\u201d said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.\nAll this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech\u2019s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon\u2019s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.\nWith so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.\n\u201cThey\u2019re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,\u201d said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. \u201cThere is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.\u201d"
