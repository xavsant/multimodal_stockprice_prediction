        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s refusal to invoke theDefense Production Actto commandeer resources for the federal government is based on a bet that he can cajole the nation\u2019s biggest manufacturers and tech firms to come together in a market-driven, if chaotic, consortium that will deliver critical equipment \u2014 from masks to ventilators \u2014 in time to abate a national crisis.\nOver the past five days, after weeks of minimizing the virus and dismissing calls to organize a national response, administration officials have been pulling executives into the White House Situation Room, and connecting them by phone, in a desperate effort to unlock existing supplies and ramp up new production.\nRear Adm. John Polowczyk has been plucked from the staff of the Joint Chiefs, where he is a senior officer for military logistics, to run the effort to build a supply chain. And Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, is also playing a leading role. The government has essentially thrown out its existing playbook for dealing with pandemics, seizing the issue from the Department of Health and Human Services and moving it to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nBut it is far from clear that the effort to enlist companies like General Motors, Apple and Hanes, just a few of the firms that have promised to free up existing supplies of masks or repurpose 3-D printers to produce ventilator parts, constitutes an effective strategy.\nIn interviews with participants in the process, from business executives to government officials, there is still widespread confusion about how much and what exactly each firm is supposed to produce. Corporate executives say they face a bewildering number of requests from dozens of nations around the world, along with governors and mayors around the country, for scarce supplies. The White House has not said who will set the priority list for deliveries. And it is not clear that any of it will arrive in time for the cities and the states that are hit the hardest, including New York.\nYet, in declining to actually make use of the Korean War-era production act that he invoked last week, Mr. Trump is also avoiding taking personal responsibility for how fast the acute shortages of personal protective gear and lifesaving equipment are addressed.\nOn Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York made a public appeal for the federal government to take over the distribution of critical goods, arguing that Mr. Trump\u2019s insistence last week that states should find the medical equipment for themselves was turning into a senseless free-for-all.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get into this mad bidding war,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, noting that the federal reticence was resulting in huge price surges, hoarding and shortages in some of the hardest-hit locales, including New York City.\nOnly the federal government can require private firms to shift their production, Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cIf I had the power, I would do it in New York,\u201d he said.\nYet as that debate has played out in the White House Situation Room, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has thrown out the established government plan for dealing with pandemics, after concluding it was insufficient because it never envisioned a pandemic of this breadth.\nMr. Kushner and other aides concluded that only FEMA had what they internally called the \u201cbattle rhythm\u201d to be the lead agency. But although the agency has experience cleaning up after tornadoes and hauling in trailers for temporary housing, \u201cit likely won\u2019t know a thing about medical supply chains and devices,\u201d said Christopher Kirchhoff, who examined the capabilities of each government agency for the Obama administration and wrote a detailed report of its shortcomings in dealing with the H1N1 swine flu virus, and then Ebola.\nWhile FEMA knows how to issue contracts rapidly and move goods, it is important not to \u201cdivorce the expertise from the execution,\u201d Mr. Kirchhoff said.\nOn Sunday, the FEMA administrator, Peter T. Gaynor, an experienced emergency manager, was unable to say how many face masks had been shipped from national stockpiles, or how many had been ordered. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a rough number; I can tell you it is happening every day,\u201d he said. That led Mr. Trump, in a late afternoon news conference, to begin to announce specific figures.\nTo Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, the core problem is not the effort now underway, but the failure to address the issue over the past three years,after government-run simulations, including one code-named Crimson Contagion, revealed some of the huge vulnerabilities.\nMr. Trump\u2019s likely opponent in the coming presidential election, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said the administration\u2019s effort was coming too late.\n\u201cNow a tragic and inescapable truth is clear: Even though the senior-most medical and intelligence experts in the United States government were sounding the alarm about coronavirus for months, President Trump neglected, minimized and lied about this virus,\u201d Mr. Biden said in a statement. \u201cHe failed to expeditiously get us enough tests, respirators, ventilators and other vital equipment when his peers in other countries did their duty and stood up for their people.\u201d\nAdministration officials, asked why they have been reluctant to use the full force of the Defense Production Act to press industry into action, say the country is not in such dire straits. There is plenty of volunteer cooperation, they say, and there is always the implicit threat of ordering mandatory measures if they do not. Mr. Trump, at the news briefing, suggested an ideological concern as well. \u201cWe\u2019re a country not based on nationalizing our business,\u201d he said.\nAt the briefing, Mr. Navarro said, \u201cWe\u2019re getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down.\u201d\nIn an interview, Mr. Navarro said the administration would not hesitate to use its powers in certain situations. For example, he said, some brokers had been hoarding supplies of masks in warehouses and trying to sell them at exorbitant prices.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a Defense Production Act action waiting to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anybody thinks they\u2019re going to sit on urgently needed supplies and profiteer from this crisis, they\u2019re going to answer to the full force of the Trump administration.\u201d\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the heads of major corporations have lobbied the administration against using the act. They say the move could prove counterproductive, imposing red tape on companies precisely when they need flexibility to deal with closed borders and shuttered factories.\nMr. Trump and the director of his national economic council, Larry Kudlow, as well as Mr. Kushner, were persuaded by those arguments, administration officials said.\nMr. Navarro has been coordinating with companies including FedEx, Hanes, Pernod Ricard and Honeywell to try to alleviate bottlenecks in the supply chain. Last week, hesent a cargo aircraft to Italyto fetch 800,000 nasal swabs for coronavirus testing, andpieced together a coalitionof fabric companies to manufacture face masks out of underwear material. On Monday, FEMA was set to airlift 3,000 Tyvek suits, 19,000 masks and 75,000 pairs of gloves from United Technologies to New York, Washington and California, Mr. Navarro said.\nAnderson Warlick, the chief executive of the textile company Parkdale Mills, said Mr. Navarro had called him early last week to ask what the company could make. By Saturday, Parkdale Mills joined Hanes, Fruit of the Loom and other companies in announcing a coalition to produce masks.\nBut they are not the kind hospitals most need. The new masks will be made of a three-ply underwear fabric, and do not provide the level of protection given by the N95 masks that health care workers need for intubation and other procedures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to wear in the operating room,\u201d Mr. Warlick said of the companies\u2019 mask. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got people out there today \u2014 it\u2019s kind of pitiful \u2014 wearing bandannas and everything else.\u201d\nWhile the corporate announcements, like Apple\u2019s move to donate millions of masks, may have generated some positive headlines for the Trump administration, critics say the ad hoc approach is falling far short of the challenge.\nIndustry executives say companies are reluctant to crank up production lines without purchasing guarantees from the government. With the economy in free-fall and factories shuttering around the country, few manufacturers are eager to invest in new machinery or venture into new products.\nAmerican companies that manufacture face masks, medical wipes and other supplies are already operating around the clock to meet elevated demand.\nAmong them, 3M has said it will increase its global production capacity by a third in the next year, but that falls far short of the current need. Honeywell is adding production for N95 masks globally, andGeneral Electricsaid it was hiring more workers and adding shifts to produce more ventilators.\nFactories that make diapers, wipes and similar products have also switched over to manufacture the raw material that goes into N95 masks.\nTo make that material, industry executives said, it would most likely take three to five months to obtain and install the necessary equipment and begin production.\nSimilar questions loom about ventilator production. The White House has highlighted promises by Ford, General Motors and Tesla to make the machines, but analysts said it could take many months for companies to create a product that would be approved as safe by regulators.\n\u201cFord, General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products, FAST!\u201d the president tweeted Sunday morning.\nBoth General Motors and Ford have declined to say how quickly they might produce ventilators; they have never done it before. A spokeswoman for Ford said the company was still assessing the possibility of producing ventilators.\nGeneral Motors said in a statement that it was working with Ventec Life Systems, which already makes ventilators, to help it rapidly scale up its production, using GM\u2019s logistics, purchasing and manufacturing expertise.\nCarla Bailo, the president of the Center for Automotive Research, said the auto companies could use their 3-D printing capabilities to produce some parts of a ventilator fairly quickly, and then turn to their extensive network of automotive suppliers for other components, like electronics and hoses.\nMs. Bailo estimated that such cooperation might yield a product in as little as three to six weeks, though it would still need regulatory approval.\nDavid E. Sanger and Ana Swanson reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Chris Cameron contributed reporting from Washington."

        "title": "There Is a Racial Divide in Speech-Recognition Systems, Researchers Say",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 With an iPhone, you can dictate a text message. Put Amazon\u2019s Alexa on your coffee table, and you can request a song from across the room.\nBut these devices may understand some voices better than others. Speech recognition systems from five of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft \u2014 make far fewer errors with users who are white than with users who are black, according to astudy published Mondayin the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe systems misidentified words about 19 percent of the time with white people. With black people, mistakes jumped to 35 percent. About 2 percent of audio snippets from white people were considered unreadable by these systems, according to the study, which was conducted by researchers at Stanford University. That rose to 20 percent with black people.\n\u201cImemean, IknewknowI\u2019mwaskinda tall forhigh schoolasking. I didn\u2019twanna play center. I didn\u2019tbecausecenter don\u2019tsend it onhave the ball that much. You get the ball occasionally when you in the post, I mean, but I didn\u2019t want to play it.\u201d\nThe study, which took an unusually comprehensive approach to measuring bias in speech recognition systems, offers another cautionary sign for A.I. technologies rapidly moving into everyday life.\nOther studies have shown that as facial recognition systems move into police departments and other government agencies, they can befar less accuratewhen trying to identify women and people of color. Separate tests have uncoveredsexistandracistbehavior in \u201cchatbots,\u201d translation services, and other systems designed to process and mimic written and spoken language.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why there is not more due diligence from these companies before these technologies are released,\u201d said Ravi Shroff, a professor of statistics at New York University who explores bias and discrimination in new technologies. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we keep seeing these problems.\u201d\nAll these systems learn by analyzing vast amounts of data. Facial recognition systems, for instance, learn by identifying patterns in thousands of digital images of faces.\nIn many cases, the systems mimic the biases they find in the data, similar to children picking up bad habits from their parents. Chatbots, for example, learn by analyzing reams of human dialogue. If this dialogue associates women with housework andmen with C.E.O. jobs, the chatbots will do the same.\nThe Stanford study indicated that leading speech recognition systems could be flawed because companies are training the technology on data that is not as diverse as it could be \u2014 learning their task mostly from white people, and relatively few black people.\n\u201cWell, when I waswhenthat\u2019sI wasreally young I had a book of basketball statistics.andNoI wouldspend a lot of time a lot of time reading them. And for some reason, I forget why now, but Jason Kiddended up beingpain. Bemy favorite player.\u201d\n\u201cHere are probably the five biggest companies doing speech recognition, and they are all making the same kind of mistake,\u201d said John Rickford, one of the Stanford researchers behind the study, who specializes in African-American speech. \u201cThe assumption is that all ethnic groups are well represented by these companies. But they are not.\u201d\nThe study tested five publicly available tools from Apple, Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft that anyone can use to build speech recognition services. These tools are not necessarily what Apple uses to build Siri or Amazon uses to build Alexa. But they may share underlying technology and practices with services like Siri and Alexa.\nEach tool was tested last year, in late May and early June, and they may operate differently now. The study also points out that when the tools were tested, Apple\u2019s tool was set up differently from the others and required some additional engineering before it could be tested.\nApple and Microsoft declined to comment on the study. An Amazon spokeswomen pointed to aweb pagewhere the company says it is constantly improving its speech recognition services. IBM did not respond to requests for comment.\nJustin Burr, a Google spokesman, said the company was committed to improving accuracy. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on the challenge of accurately recognizing variations of speech for several years, and will continue to do so,\u201d he said.\nThe researchers used these systems to transcribe interviews with 42 people who were white and 73 who were black. Then they compared the results from each group, showing a significantly higher error rate with the people who were black.\nThe best performing system, from Microsoft, misidentified about 15 percent of words from white people and 27 percent from black people. Apple\u2019s system, the lowest performer, failed 23 percent of the time with whites and 45 percent of the time with black people.\nBased in a largely African-American rural community in eastern North Carolina, a midsize city in western New York and Washington, D.C., the black testers spoke in what linguists call African-American Vernacular English \u2014 a variety of English sometimes spoken by African-Americans in urban areas and other parts of the United States. The white people were in California, some in the state capital, Sacramento, and others from a rural and largely white area about 300 miles away.\nThe study found that the \u201crace gap\u201d was just as large when comparing the identical phrases uttered by both black and white people. This indicates that the problem lies in the way the systems are trained to recognize sound. The companies, it seems, are not training on enough data that represents African-American Vernacular English, according to the researchers.\n\u201cMy mom you know when she was had the store and shewould usedwill useto closethecloseststore.aboutByeleven o-clock and she would promiseus, now when we\u2019re closed upand I were closer. We couldwe\u2019rejustgonnagotake a ride andaroundlook at the town.\u201d\n\u201cThe results are not isolated to one specific firm,\u201d said Sharad Goel, a professor of engineering at Stanford and another researcher involved in the study. \u201cWe saw qualitatively similar patterns across all five firms.\u201d\nThe companies are aware of the problem. In 2014, for example, Google researchers published a paperdescribing bias in an earlier breed of speech recognition.\nIn November, during aspeechat Stanford dedicated to \u201cethical\u201d artificial intelligence, Eric Schmidt, the former Google chief executive and chairman, said Google and the rest of Silicon Valley were well aware that the way A.I. systems were being built needed fixing.\n\u201cWe know the data has bias in it. You don\u2019t need to yell that as a new fact,\u201d he said. \u201cHumans have bias in them, our systems have bias in them. The question is: What do we do about it?\u201d\nCompanies like Google may have trouble gathering the right data, and they may not be motivated enough to gather it. \u201cThis is difficult to fix,\u201d said Brendan O\u2019Connor, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who specializes in A.I. technologies. \u201cThe data is hard to collect. You are fighting an uphill battle.\u201d\nThe companies may face a chicken-and-egg problem. If their services are used mostly by white people, they will have trouble gathering data that can serve black people. And if they have trouble gathering this data, the services will continue to be used mostly by white people.\n\u201cThose feedback loops are kind of scary when you start thinking about them,\u201d said Noah Smith, a professor at the University of Washington. \u201cThat is a major concern.\u201d"

        "title": "Big Tech Could Emerge From Coronavirus Crisis Stronger Than Ever",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 While the rest of the economy is tanking from the crippling impact of thecoronavirus, business at the biggest technology companies is holding steady \u2014 even thriving.\nAmazon said it washiring 100,000 warehouse workersto meet surging demand. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, said traffic for video calling and messaging had exploded. Microsoft said the numbers using its software for online collaboration had climbed nearly 40 percent in a week.\nWith people told to work from home and stay away from others, the pandemic has deepened reliance on services from the technology industry\u2019s biggest companies while accelerating trends that were already benefiting them.\nAmazon has muscled in on brick-and-mortar retailers for years, but shoppers now reluctant to go to the store are turning to the e-commerce giant for a wider variety of goods, like groceries and over-the-counter drugs.\nStreaming services like Netflix have dampened box office sales for movies in recent years. Now, as movie theaters close under government orders, Netflix and YouTube are gaining a new audience.\nCompanies were already dumping their own data centers to rent computing from Amazon, Microsoft and Google. That shift is likely to speed up as millions of employees are forced to work from home, putting a strain on corporate technology infrastructures.\nEven Apple, which once appeared to be among the American companiesmost at riskfrom the coronavirus because of its dependence on Chinese factories and consumers, appears to be on good footing. Many of Apple\u2019s factories are nearly back to normal, people are spending more time and money on its digital services, and on Wednesday it even released new gadgets.\n\u201cThe largest tech companies could emerge on the other side of this much stronger,\u201d said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities.\nThat\u2019s not to say to say major technology companies shouldn\u2019t be worried. Advertising, the lifeblood of Google and Facebook, tends to suffer during economic downturns. The stocks of Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, have collectively lostmore than $1 trillion in market valuefrom a month ago, when U.S. stocks traded at record highs. And Microsoft and Apple have cut their short-term financial forecasts because of slowing consumer spending.\nBeyond the biggest companies, it is more of a struggle. Communication tools like the videoconferencing service Zoom are now essential, but ride-hailing firms like Uber and Lyft and property-rental sites like Airbnb are seeing customers vanish.\nThe $3.9 trillion global technology industry will suffer this year, though just how much remains unclear. In December, the research firm IDC forecast 5 percent worldwide growth for sales of hardware, software and services in 2020. After it became apparent a month ago that the coronavirus would disrupt supplies and cut sales in China, IDC said annual revenue might inch ahead at only 1 percent. That 1 percent growth now looks decidedly optimistic, said Frank Gens, chief analyst at IDC.\nBut when the economy does eventually improve, Big Tech could benefit from changes in consumer habits. And despite more than 18 months of criticism from lawmakers, regulators and competitors before the pandemic hit the United States, the biggest companies are likely to finish the year stronger than ever.\nWhile Amazon has changed shopping habits for items like books, getting customers to trust it with grocerieshas been challenging. Now, as more people are forced to stay home, one of the last strongholds of physical retailing may be coming under pressure.\nMichael Crowe of Charlotte, N.C., ordered groceries from Amazon for the first time a few days ago because he didn\u2019t want to risk going to a supermarket, he said.\n\u201cI could see myself doing it longer term when this is over,\u201d said Mr. Crowe, 36, who works for the home improvement retailer Lowe\u2019s.\nAs more customers try different Amazon services, they may create permanent shifts in buying habits, said Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon employee and the founder of CommerceIQ, a company whose automation software is used by major brands like Kellogg\u2019s and Kimberly-Clark.\nIn a blog post last week, Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said it was adding the new jobs at its U.S. warehouses and delivery network because \u201cour labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year.\u201d\nOne reason for Amazon\u2019s increase in demand is that shoppers are buying a broader variety of goods. From Feb. 20 to March 15, over-the-counter cold medicine sales rose ninefold on Amazon in the United States from a year earlier. Dog food orders increased 13-fold, and paper towels and toilet paper sales tripled, according to CommerceIQ.\nStay-at-home orders are unsurprisingly increasing traffic to video streaming sites, apps and social media platforms. Downloads of Netflix\u2019s app \u2014 a proxy for traffic from the streaming site \u2014 jumped 66 percent in Italy, according to data from Sensor Tower, an app data company. In Spain, they rose 35 percent. In the United States, where Netflix was already popular, there was a 9 percent bump.\nNetflix declined to comment on whether it was seeing a surge in subscribers.\nGovernment officials in Europe evencalledReed Hastings, the chief executive, to ask if Netflix could reduce the video quality of its streams to lighten the strain on the region\u2019s internet network. The company agreed to do it for 30 days. YouTube also agreed to suspend streaming of high-definition video in Europe for a month.\nVoice calling over Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service has doubled in volume, Mr. Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday. Facebook\u2019s Messenger app has had similar growth, he said.\n\u201cSo the normal spike for us is New Year\u2019s Eve, right, where basically everyone at the same time just wants to message everyone and takes a selfie and sends to their family wherever they are, and to wish them a happy New Year,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg said. \u201cAnd we are well beyond\u201d that spike.\nAnalysts are bullish about Facebook\u2019s prospects because many people turn to it for news in times of crisis and to distract themselves while working from home.\n\u201cWe believe that many Facebook users have been accessing its properties at meaningfully elevated levels over the last several weeks,\u201d Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote in a research note last week.\nThe shift to work at home has also demonstrated the merits of cloud computing when use unexpectedly spikes. For companies managing their internet infrastructures, making adjustments to computing needs on the fly is expensive and complicated. Cloud computing makes it easier.\nAmazon, Microsoft and Google, the three major cloud-computing platforms, are swimming in cash and offering deep discounts for renting the underlying infrastructure for a corporate network as well as the software used by employees.\nMicrosoft has aggressively pushed its new business messaging and collaboration tool, Microsoft Teams, which competes with the independent company Slack. On Thursday,Microsoft saidthe number of users on Teams had grown 37 percent in a week to more than 44 million daily users. There have been at least 900 million meeting and call minutes on Teams every day.\n\u201cWe believe that this sudden, globe-spanning move to remote work will be a turning point in how we work and learn,\u201d wrote Jared Spataro, a corporate vice president at Microsoft.\nEven Apple, a company with hundreds of closed stores around the world (except now in China), is increasingly looking as if it will emerge from the pandemic in good shape.\nTerry Guo, the head of Foxconn, which assembles most of the world\u2019s iPhones for Apple,told reporterson March 12 that Foxconn\u2019s Chinese factories were resuming production ahead of schedule and were back to normal \u2014 well ahead of expectations that would happen by the end of March.\nApple has tried to move away from its heavy reliance on device sales and toward so-called services revenue, which includes app sales and subscriptions to its music and TV services.\nFor that business, having much of the public in the United States and Europe stay inside is almost certainly good news. Early data shows thatpeople are spending more timewatching TV. Apple has spent billions of dollars on original programming for its Apple TV Plus service, hoping to hook people enough to pay $5 a month for it.\nMore time and money spent on phones is also good news for Apple and Google because they take a cut of most app sales.\nOver the first 10 weeks of the year, Apple\u2019s cut of iPhone app sales grew 18 percent to roughly $690 million, while Google\u2019s share of Android app sales rose 5 percent to roughly $360 million, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm.\nOver the past two weeks in the United States, their revenues increased more sharply. U.S. iPhone app sales grew 20 percent to roughly $670 million, while U.S. Android app sales increased 14 percent to about $380 million, according to Sensor Tower.\n\u201cAfter the financial crisis in 2008, Apple emerged even stronger,\u201d said Mr. Ives from Wedbush. \u201cThere is no reason it and the other giants can\u2019t do the same again.\u201d\nDaisuke Wakabayashi and Jack Nicas reported from Oakland, Mike Isaac from San Francisco, and Steve Lohr from New York.

        "title": "Apple Agrees to Pay Some iPhone Owners $25 Each",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 ManyiPhoneowners believe Apple purposely slowed down their old devices as it released new ones. Now some of them might be in line for a small payday: Apple has agreed to pay someiPhoneowners about $25 each to settle such complaints.\nUnder a proposed settlement disclosed on Friday, Apple agreed to pay up to $500 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of intentionally slowing down certain iPhones years after they were released.\nThe settlement requires a federal judge\u2019s approval. A decision is expected to take several months.\nOn Monday, an Apple spokeswoman pointed to court documents in which the company denied the allegations and agreed to the settlement to avoid costly litigation. \u201cThe settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing, fault, liability or damage of any kind,\u201d Apple said. (Such language is common in settlements.)\nIn late 2017, customerspublicly complainedthat they believed Apple was engaged in so-called planned obsolescence \u2014 intentionally slowing its older phones as it released new models. In response, Apple said software on certain older iPhonessometimes reduced their processing powerwhen the battery was low to prevent them from abruptly shutting down.\nThat statement angered many customers, and Apple sharply cut the cost of replacing old iPhones\u2019 batteries, even making it free for some devices.\nA group of Apple customers then sued. The two sides fought in court for two years before agreeing to the proposed settlement last week.\nApple would pay between $310 million and $500 million, depending on how many customers filed claims. Customers are expected to receive $25 per eligible device they owned, though they could receive more if fewer customers than expected file claims. The plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers would also get a cut.\nEligible devices include any iPhone 6, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus and SE that ran iOS 10.2.1 or later, or any iPhone 7 or 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later. Eligible customers had to live in the United States, and their devices had to run the given software before Dec. 21, 2017.\nMost of those eligible devices ran those versions of the software, according to Mark Molumphy, one of the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers.\nUnder the proposed settlement, customers would not need to submit a receipt to file a claim. \u201cThe process is a very simple claim form that you attest that you downloaded the software and experienced the issues,\u201d Mr. Molumphy said."

        "title": "Apple Closes Most of Its Stores for 2 Weeks",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Apple said it would close most of its retail stores outside mainlandChina, Hong Kong and Taiwan, becoming one of the first companies to take such a drastic measure to fight the coronavirus outbreak.\nThe move signaled that retailers might be the next part of society to shut their doors.\nApple is closing more than 450 stores across 21 countries until March 27. \u201cThe most effective way to minimize risk of the virus\u2019s transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement posted on Friday to the company\u2019s website.\nApple said employees at its closed stores would be paid as normal.\nApple\u2019s move was a stark example of how the epicenter of the virus has now spread well beyond China.\nThe tech giant closed its 42 stores in China in January because of the coronavirus. But now, as the number of people contracting the virus has slowed there and risen sharply elsewhere, Apple has reopened its stores in the China region and closed them everywhere else.\nThe outbreak, declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has upended societies across much of the world over the past several days as governments and companies responded to the virus\u2019s rapid advancement. Supply chains have been disrupted; planes have flown nearly empty; and sports stadiums, theaters and museums have closed their doors.\nSo far, retail stores had mostly remained open. But Apple\u2019s move might be a sign that is about to change, as many other companies contemplate similar measures. Patagonia, the outdoor-clothing retailer, said on Friday that it would shut its stores until late March. Starbucks has said it would consider closing stores temporarily as a \u201clast resort,\u201d after an employee at a downtown Seattle locationwas confirmed to have the virus.\nWhile online shopping could help mitigate the impact of store closures for some retailers, shutting down for even several weeks would further slash sales for most companies, magnifying the toll the coronavirus is already taking on global business.\nDuring the early spread of the virus in China, Apple was one of the Western companies most affected, because it makes nearly all its products in the country and sells about a fifth of them there. The Chinese factories that make the world\u2019s iPhones, iPads and MacBooks were closed for weeks. And with its stores closed and many Chinese residents confined to their homes, Apple\u2019s sales there fell, causing the company tocuts its sales forecastfor the quarter.\nNow, things appear to be returning to some semblance of normalcy in China for Apple. Its largest supplier, Foxconn, which assembles most iPhones, said this month that its plants were at about 50 percent capacity and that it aimed to resume full production by the end of the month.\nSeparately on Friday, Apple said its annual conference, which attracts thousands of software developers to a convention center in San Jose, Calif., each June, would be held online. Like many tech companies, Apple had already asked most of its employees around the world to work at home."

        "title": "France Fines Apple $1.2 Billion for Antitrust Issues",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 France\u2019s antitrust regulator on Monday fined Apple 1.1 billion euros, or $1.2 billion, putting more pressure on the company as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak that has threatened its supply chains and closed its retail stores.\nFrance\u2019s competition regulator, which had been examining wholesalers who sell Apple\u2019s products in the country, said the company had unfairly divided products and customers between two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro. The regulator accused Apple of making its wholesalers charge the same prices for products offered in Apple\u2019s own retail stores and abusing its broad economic power over the firms.\nIsabelle de Silva, the president of the French Competition Authority, said in a statement that dividing duties among the wholesalers also had the effect of \u201csterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products.\u201d Tech Data and Ingram Micro were each fined millions of euros.\nAn Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, said in a statement that the company planned to appeal the decision.\n\u201cThe French Competition Authority\u2019s decision is disheartening,\u201d Mr. Rosenstock said. \u201cIt relates to practices from over a decade ago and discards 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.\u201d\nAntitrust regulators around the world are increasingly scrutinizing major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Amazon for possible violations of antitrust law. In the United States, the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, the House of Representatives and state attorneys general areall examining the companies\u2019 market power.\nCompetitors and activists have accused Apple of trying to elbow out its competitors for services like music streaming, taking a cut of their in-app subscriptions andgiving an edge to its own products in the app storesfor iPhone and Apple computer users.\nLike other companies, Apple is grappling with the impact of the coronavirus on its business, which is heavily dependent on the kind of global supply chains that the pandemic has disrupted.\nAs the virus spread through China this year, many of the factories that make Apple\u2019s products were closed. Apple also closed its stores in the country.\nLast month, the companycut its sales expectationsfor the quarter, citing the virus.\nApple\u2019s stores and its suppliers\u2019 factories have started to reopen in China. But the virus is already affecting its business elsewhere.\nOn Saturday, the company said itwould closemost of its stores outside mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong until late March to encourage physical distancing that may slow down the pandemic.\nApple has also asked most of its employees around the world to work from home. Its annual developers conference \u2014 traditionally a venue for some of its major product announcements \u2014 will take place online instead of in person."
