        "title": "Everybody Into the Metaverse! Virtual Reality Beckons Big Tech.",
        "fulltext": "The metaverse, one of the most buzzy terms of the tech industry, could be many things. It could be a virtual world where imagination is the only limit. Or it could be a less fantastical place for holding business meetings without leaving home.\nFor the tech titans getting behind this big idea, the metaverse could be something more tangible: the next great way to make piles of money.\nAfter 15 years of riding a boom in mobile computing that has turned tech\u2019s biggest companies into giants worth trillions of dollars, the power brokers of the industry believe that controlling the doors into the metaverse and virtual reality could be the centerpiece of a new business, like smartphones and apps or personal computers and web browsers in the 1990s.\nFifteen years is a long time for the industry to wait for a new tech trend to come along. Ideas that many hoped would take central stage by now, like advanced artificial intelligence and quantum computing, are taking longer than some had anticipated. And the technology behind cryptocurrencies and newer ideas like decentralized computing appears promising \u2014 but its mainstream appeal is still unclear.\nSo tech companies are lining up to sell the devices that let consumers into this virtual world and control their experiences once they are inside it. Suddenly, building new things for the metaverse is offering the kind of fresh appeal that comes along only every so often in any industry.\nMark Zuckerberg is so excited about the metaverse that he recently made the attention-grabbing decisionto change his company\u2019s name from Facebook to Meta. Google has been working on metaverse-related technology for years. Apple, arguably the biggest winner of the mobile boom, has its own devices in the works. Microsoft is putting a corporate spin on the metaverse, offering a headset to businesses and government agencies.\n\u201cMost companies now see that the metaverse is around the corner,\u201d said Matthew Ball, a venture capitalist and an essayist who has written extensively about this concept and the hype that has sprung up around it. \u201cThe narrative is a little ahead of the reality of these technologies, but this is a response to the enormity of the opportunity.\u201d\nOne research firm estimatesthat the market for metaverse technologies \u2014 including games, virtual reality headsets, and other emerging gadgets and online services \u2014 topped $49 billion in 2020 and will grow by more than 40 percent each year.\n\u201cThis is the evolution of the internet,\u201d said Alex Kipman, who has spent more than a decade shepherding this kind of technology at Microsoft. \u201cIf you are a company like Microsoft, you want to participate.\u201d\nFocusing attention on the metaverse also allows companies like Facebook to focus on something other than their problems with content moderation, misinformation and regulators accusing them of monopolistic practices. But it could also lead to new scrutiny of old issues like privacy and managing who does what to whom in a virtual world.\nThe metaverse is not a new idea. Thescience fiction writer Neal Stephenson coined the term in 1992, and the concept is commonplace among video game companies. For decades, massively multiplayer online games have served as digital worlds where people can meet, chat and do business. Some, like Second Life, an online fad more than a decade ago, were designed as purely social spaces.\nIn 2014, in a deal valued at more than $2 billion, Facebook acquired Oculus, a start-up that made virtual reality headsets \u2014goggles that trick your brain into thinking you are inside a digital landscape. Mr. Zuckerberg began describing virtual reality as the next big computing platform, though exactly when that would happen was hard to predict.\nMr. Zuckerberg says the metaverse willpervade daily life in ways games do not, offering new avenues for buying goods and services, communicating with friends and family and collaborating with colleagues. But at the moment, Meta\u2019s headsets are big and cumbersome. Sometimes, they make people sick. They completely cover the eyes, separating people from the world around them.\nApple, a company known for building enormously popular, consumer-friendly devices, is among the many companies working to improve these headsets, a person familiar with the project said. But there are physical limitations holding the technology back.\nApple\u2019s prototype, which looks like a pair of ski goggles, requires a separate hardware device that connects to the headset and must be worn elsewhere on the body, the person said. Apple declined to comment.\nUltimately, many experts argue, Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s vision will be realized only through lightweight eyeglasses that can layer digital images onto what you see in the real world \u2014 often called \u201caugmented reality.\u201d\nAs people walk down the street, they could check the latest sports scores from a digital display that seems to float in front of them. They could sit down for a meeting with people who are right next to them \u2014 and others who are not.\nGoogle is among those developing this kind of eyewear. Years after introducing Google Glass \u2014 smart glasses that faced enormous backlash over theirgeeky vibe and casual approach to personal privacy\u2014 the company is nurturing a new project.\nLast year, Google acquired a start-up called North, which had purchased many of the patents behind a smart-glasses project that originated at the computer chip giant Intel. The glasses could project digital images directly into the eyes of the people who wore them, and though they were heavier than ordinary glasses, they were reasonably comfortable, according to early testers. Google declined to comment.\nBut the mainstream appeal of what tech companies are describing is still an open question. Virtual reality that completely covers the eyes \u201cis something you will use for certain tasks \u2014 and the experience might be amazing \u2014 but it is not something for the general public,\u201d said Nikhil Balram, who helped oversee the development of virtual and augmented reality hardware at Google until November last year.\nIntel\u2019s augmented reality project produced a prototype, Vaunt, which was tested with consumers. The leader of the project, Jerry Bautista, said in a recent interview that these glasses showed enormous promise not just as a personal technology that people wanted to use but as a new kind of computing platform that could provide new sources of revenue.\n\u201cWe were giving away the hardware but making money on the data,\u201d he said. \u201cFor every dollar of hardware, we were making three dollars on software and data sales.\u201d\nThis is why companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta are exploring similar technologies. For some, they might be a way of selling software and services. For others, they might be a way of selling ads, Dr. Bautista said.\nBut experts say perfecting this technology could take a decade \u2014 if not more. Some augmented reality glasses are as small and light as ordinary eyewear, but they do not yet offer the computing power needed to generate the convincing but unobtrusive images that everyday use would require.\n\u201cIt sometimes feels like \u201810 years\u2019 is code for \u2018I have no idea,\u2019\u201d said Dr. Balram, who is developing augmented reality glasses at a company called EyeWay Vision after leaving Google.\nIn 2018, Intel shut down the Vaunt project, before selling many of its patents to North, the start-up acquired by Google. Ultimately, Dr. Bautista said, the company felt it was just too difficult to answer the many questions surrounding the technology.\nBecause of privacy regulations in Europe and other parts of the world, he said, the project could end up harming the bottom line more than it helped. The company estimated that 3 percent of its yearly revenues could be at risk, he said.\nNow, many of the world\u2019s most powerful tech companies are facing the same questions.\n\u201cWe can build amazing things,\u201d Dr. Bautista said. \u201cThe hardware is not the hard part. The business models are not the hard part. Finding ways these devices can be used is not the hard part. The hard part is: What happens if the data leaks out?\u201d\nBrian X.

        "fulltext": "Apple, which had alreadydelayed its employees\u2019 returnto physical offices from September to October to January to February, has a new timeline: to be determined.\nTim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told employees in a message viewed by The New York Times on Wednesday that the company was delaying a return to hybrid work \u201cto a date yet to be determined.\u201d\nHe said the decision was made because of the surge of the coronavirus around the world, fueled bythe contagious Omicron variant. Mr. Cook also said the company would provide an additional $1,000 to each employee to help furnish home offices.\nThe company confirmed the postponement but declined to comment further.\nThe news came on the heels of Apple\u2019s temporarily closing three retail stores, in Miami, Annapolis, Md., and Ottawa, amid a spike of positive tests and exposure among employees at those stores.\nUnlike other big tech companies like Facebook, which has allowed employees to request to work from home permanently, Apple has maintained that it wants its workers to return to the office at least part-time when it is safe to do so. That has led to conflict with some of its workers, who fought this plan over the summer, a clash that evolved into AppleToo,a broader activist movementat the company.\nWith its new indefinite timeline, Apple joins agrowing list of companiesthat have bowed to the unpredictable ebbs and flows of the pandemic by scrapping specific return dates."

        "title": "Are Apple AirTags Being Used to Track People and Steal Cars?",
        "fulltext": "On a Sunday night in September, Ashley Estrada was at a friend\u2019s home in Los Angeles when she received a strange notification on her iPhone: \u201cAirTag Detected Near You.\u201d\nAn AirTag is a 1.26-inch disc with location-tracking capabilities thatApplestarted selling earlier this year as a way \u201cto keep track of your stuff.\u201d Ms. Estrada, 24, didn\u2019t own one, nor did the friends she was with. The notification on her phone said the AirTag had first been spotted with her four hours earlier. A map of the AirTag\u2019s history showed the zigzag path Ms. Estrada had driven across the city while running errands.\n\u201cI felt so violated,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt like, who\u2019s tracking me? What was their intent with me? It was scary.\u201d\nMs. Estrada is not alone in her experience. In recent months, people haveposted on TikTok,RedditandTwitterabout finding AirTags on their cars and in their belongings. There is growing concern that the devices may be abetting a new form of stalking, which privacy groups predicted could happen when Apple introduced the devices in April.\nThe New York Times spoke with seven women who believe they were tracked with AirTags, including a 17-year-old whose mother surreptitiously placed one on her car to stay apprised of her whereabouts.\nSome authorities have begun to take a closer look at the threat posed by AirTags. The West Seneca Police Department in New York recentlywarned its communityof the tracking potential of the devices after an AirTag was found on a car bumper. Apple complied with a subpoena for information about the AirTag in the case, which may lead to charges, West Seneca police said.\nAnd in Canada, alocal police departmentsaid that it had investigated five incidents of thieves placing AirTags on \u201chigh-end vehicles so they can later locate and steal them.\u201d\nResearchers now believe AirTags, which are equipped with Bluetooth technology, could be revealing a more widespread problem of tech-enabled tracking. They emit a digital signal that can be detected by devices running Apple\u2019s mobile operating system. Those devices then report where an AirTag has last been seen. Unlike similar tracking products from competitors such as Tile, Apple added features to prevent abuse, including notifications like the one Ms. Estrada received and automatic beeping. (Tile plans to releasea featureto prevent the tracking of people next year, a spokeswoman for that company said.)\nBut AirTags present a \u201cuniquely harmful\u201d threat because the ubiquity of Apple\u2019s products allows for more exact monitoring of people\u2019s movements, said Eva Galperin, a cybersecurity director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation who studies so-calledstalkerware.\n\u201cApple automatically turned every iOS device into part of the network that AirTags use to report the location of an AirTag,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThe network that Apple has access to is larger and more powerful than that used by the other trackers. It\u2019s more powerful for tracking and more dangerous for stalking.\u201d\nApple does not disclose sales figures, but the tiny $29 AirTags have proved popular, selling out consistently since their unveiling.\nAn Apple spokesman, Alex Kirschner, said in a statement that the company takes customer safety \u201cvery seriously\u201d and is \u201ccommitted to AirTag\u2019s privacy and security.\u201d He said the small devices have features that inform users if an unknown AirTag might be with them and that deter bad actors from using an AirTag for nefarious purposes.\n\u201cIf users ever feel their safety is at risk, they are encouraged to contact local law enforcement who can work with Apple to provide any available information about the unknown AirTag,\u201d Mr. Kirschner said.\nPolice could ask Apple to provide information about the owner of the AirTag, potentially identifying the culprit. But some of the people who spoke with The Times were unable to find the associated AirTags they were notified of and said the police do not always take reports of the notifications on their phones seriously.\nAfter a Friday night out with her boyfriend this month, Erika Torres, a graduate music student in New Orleans, was notified by her iPhone that an \u201cunknown accessory\u201d had been detected near her over a two-hour period, moving with her from a bar to her home.\nShe called the police and she called Apple, but she never found an AirTag. An Apple representative told herother devicescould set off the alert, including AirPods. When Ms. Torres posted a video about her experience to YouTube, a dozen people commented about it happening to them. \u201cThe number of reports makes me think there must be some sort of glitch that is causing all these people to experience this,\u201d Ms. Torres said. \u201cI hope they\u2019re not all being stalked.\u201d\nMs. Estrada, who got the notification while in Los Angeles, eventually found the quarter-sized tracker lodged in a space behind the license plate of her 2020 Dodge Charger. Sheposted a videoof her ordeal on TikTok, which went viral.\n\u201cApple probably released this product with the intent to do good, but this shows that the technology can be used for good and bad purposes,\u201d Ms. Estrada said.\nMs. Estrada said she was told by a Los Angeles police dispatcher that her situation was a nonemergency and that if she wanted to file a report she\u2019d have to bring the device with her to the station in the morning. She didn\u2019t want to wait and disposed of it after taking several photos.\nA spokesperson for the Los Angeles police told The Times that the department had not heard of cases in which an AirTag had been used to track a person or a vehicle. But Ms. Estrada said that after she posted her TikTok video, an Apple employee, acting on their own, contacted her. The employee was able to connect the AirTag to a woman whose address was in Central Los Angeles.\nAnother woman was notified by her iPhone that she was being tracked by an \u201cunknown accessory\u201d after leaving her gym in November. When she got home, she called the police.\nThe woman, Michaela Clough of Corning, Calif., was told that a report could only be filed if someone showed up at her home and that Apple\u2019s notifications were not enough proof that she was being stalked. She later got in touch with an Apple customer service representative who was able to disconnect the device from Ms. Clough\u2019s iPhone. The device was never found.\n\u201cI was terrified and frustrated that there was nothing I could do about it,\u201d Ms. Clough said, noting that she hadn\u2019t returned to her gym since. \u201cFor a good week there, I just stayed home.\u201d\nAirTags and other products connected to Apple\u2019s location-tracking network, called \u201cFind My,\u201d trigger alerts to unknown iPhones they travel with. The AirTag product page on Apple\u2019s website notes that the devices are \u201cdesigned to discourage unwanted tracking\u201d and that they will play a sound after a certain amount of time of not detecting the device to which they are paired.\nIn June, after concerns about stalking were raised, Applepushed an updateto AirTags to cause them to start beeping within a day of being away from their linked devices, down from three days. Still, \u201cthey don\u2019t beep very loudly,\u201d Ms. Galperin said.\nA person who doesn\u2019t own an iPhone might have a harder time detecting an unwanted AirTag. AirTags aren\u2019t compatible with Android smartphones. Earlier this month, Apple released an Android app that can scan for AirTags \u2014 but you have to be vigilant enough to download it and proactively use it.\nApple declined to say if it was working with Google on technology that would allow Android phones to automatically detect its trackers.\nPeople who said they have been tracked have called Apple\u2019s safeguards insufficient. Ms. Estrada said she was notified four hours after her phone first noticed the rogue gadget. Others said it took days before they were made aware of an unknown AirTag. According to Apple, the timing of the alerts can vary depending on the iPhone\u2019s operating system and location settings.\nThe devices\u2019 inconsistencies have caused confusion for people who weren\u2019t necessarily being tracked nefariously. Mary Ford, a 17-year-old high school student from Cary, N.C., received a notification in late October that she was being tracked by an unknown AirTag after driving to an appointment. She panicked as she searched her car.\nMs. Ford only realized it wasn\u2019t a threat when her mother revealed she had put the tracker in the vehicle about two weeks earlier to follow her daughter\u2019s whereabouts.\n\u201cI was nervous about Mary being out and not being able to find her,\u201d said her mother, Wendy Ford. She said she hadn\u2019t intended to keep the knowledge of the AirTag from her daughter, \u201cbut if I knew she would have been notified, I probably would have told her.\u201d\nJahna Maramba rented a vehicle from the car-sharing service Turo last month in Los Angeles, then received a notification about an unknown AirTag near her on a Saturday night with her girlfriends.\nShe took the vehicle to her friend\u2019s parking garage where she searched the outside of the car for an hour before its owner notified her that he had placed the device inside the vehicle. Ms. Maramba had been driving the car for two days.\nA spokesperson for Turo said in a statement that the company has no control over the technology car owners use on the vehicles they rent out.\n\u201cImagine finding out via a notification that you\u2019re being tracked,\u201d Ms. Maramba said. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d"

        "title": "House Votes to Impose Forced Labor Ban on Goods Made in Xinjiang",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill that would ban a wide array of imported products made inChina\u2019s Xinjiang region, moving over the strong objections of large corporations to crack down on companies sourcing goods produced through forced labor by persecutedMuslim minorities.\nThe lopsided 428-to-1 vote reflected increasing bipartisan ire at China\u2019s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where officials have waged a campaign of repression against Uyghurs, the Muslim ethnic minority group,detaining as many as one millionin internment camps and prisons. But the legislation\u2019s fate is uncertain in the Senate, where similar efforts have stalled amid a fierce lobbying effort by businesses that have argued that the bill\u2019s requirements are too onerous and would disrupt global supply chains.\nThe measure would impose high standards for companies seeking to import products from the region, barring imports of goods made \u201cin whole or in part\u201d in Xinjiang unless companies could proactively prove to customs officials that the products were not made with forced labor.\nThe Biden administration, like the Trump administration before it, has declared that it considers China\u2019s wide-scale repression of Uyghurs in itsnorthwestern Xinjiang regiona genocide, and accused the Chinese government of committing crimes against humanity.\nThose offenses have included placing Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in concentration camps, forced sterilizations and abortions, and torture and sexual abuse. Lawmakers have been particularly aggressive in trying to compel companies to cut ties with suppliers implicated in Uyghurforced labor.\n\u201cWe will never forget our responsibility to act upon the actions that the Chinese government is engaged in,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said on Wednesday. The legislation, she said, \u201cemploys America\u2019s great economic might to combat this brutality and hold the perpetrators accountable.\u201d\nRepresentative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, cast the sole \u201cno\u201d vote. He has said he opposes the bill because he believes the United States should not interfere in the internal affairs of foreign countries.\nThe resounding approval capped months of simmering tensions among lawmakers, Biden administration officials and corporate lobbyists, who sometimes found themselves at odds over exactly how far the legislation should go.\nA number of prominent business groups and companies had bristled at the standard at the heart of the bill, which presumes that all goods produced in the region are made with forced labor unless companies can prove otherwise. They have argued that it would be overly arduous given the opacity of Chinese supply chains and the difficulty in auditing them.\nCompanies includingNike, Coca-Cola and Applelobbied Congress in an attempt to weaken that provision, claiming that the passage of the bill could wreak havoc on already crippled supply chains. Roughly one in five cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn fromXinjiang, and the region produces asignificant portionof the world\u2019s polysilicon, which is used to make solar panels and smartphones.\n\u201cIt is a piece of legislation that will impose substantial constraints and costs on corporations that have been operating their supply chains in ways that ignore labor rights with impunity,\u201d said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights organization. \u201cAnd it is vehemently opposed by powerful corporations across industrial sectors.\u201d\nRepresentative Thomas Suozzi, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Uyghur Caucus, acknowledged in an interview that a number of counterarguments had quietly loomed over the bill, from corporate lobbyists nervous about profits and supply chains to climate hawks worried about endangering the nation\u2019s access to solar panels.\n\u201cTo all those things, I say, \u2018That\u2019s too damn bad,\u2019\u201d Mr. Suozzi said. \u201cWe have to do this. This is so egregious that we\u2019ll have to just figure out another solution. We\u2019re just going to have to innovate our way around it. We can\u2019t allow this to continue.\u201d\nThe legislation passed theHousein September 2020 by a406-to-3 vote. At that time, it faced headwinds in the Senate, especially on the Banking Committee, where some lawmakers were sensitive to corporate concerns about a stringent reporting requirement embedded in the text.\nThat provision, which would require companies to disclose the extent of a wide range of activities conducted in the Xinjiang region, was ultimately stripped out of the Senate bill, which passed unanimously in July.\nBut the measure languished, with neither the House nor the Senate interested in taking up the other\u2019s bill. The House advanced a larger China-focused measure that included a version of the Uyghur legislation with the reporting mandate intact, but the Senate declined to take it up.\nThose issues are likely to crop up again as the bill passed by the House on Wednesday makes its way to the Senate.\nThe fresh burst of momentum behind the proposal came after Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, held up the annual defense bill, demanding that his version of the forced labor legislation get a vote. Mr. Rubio accused Democrats of bowing to pressure from corporations and the Biden administration in slowing consideration of the legislation, a charge they hotly contested.\nMr. Rubio said in a brief interview that while he was heartened to see the House pass its legislation, he was worried that reconciling the two versions of the bill would prove cumbersome.\n\u201cThe problem for me is not the content, it\u2019s the fact that it touches on some issues\u201d that cross several committees\u2019 jurisdictions, he said.\nThe House on Wednesday also approvedlegislation admonishing the International Olympic Committeefor \u201cfailing to adhere to its own human rights commitments\u201d inthe case of Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star who disappeared shortly after accusing a former top government official of sexual assault.\nIn statements addressing the situation, the I.O.C. has refused to mention her assault claims and accepted Chinese government officials\u2019 assurances that Ms. Peng is safe. The committee has argued that its nonconfrontational approach has been in the interest of helping Ms. Shuai through \u201cquiet diplomacy.\u201d\n\u201cThe I.O.C. has once again failed to protect athletes from sexual abuse and harassment, and should publicly commit to hold sexual violence abusers accountable,\u201d said the legislation, led by Representative Jennifer Wexton, Democrat of Virginia. \u201cThe I.O.C.\u2019s conduct undermines the efforts by the United States government, human rights organizations, the Women\u2019s Tennis Association, and other international bodies and individuals to secure Peng Shuai\u2019s safety.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nBig Tech got bigger-er and stronger in 2021. The empires of technology also appeared more vulnerable than ever to the forces of regulation, competition, a complicated public mood and perhaps hubris.\nYup, this is a contradiction. But this stronger-but-weaker phenomenon for Big Tech is likely to continue in 2022.\nBehind this trend is the samequestionI keep asking in this newsletter: Are American technology superpowers including Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebookinvinciblein a way that prior generations of corporate titans were not?\nFirst, here\u2019s a glimpse at ways that Big Tech reached thestratospherein 2021. Apple, already the world\u2019s most valuable business, is close to reaching an unimaginable stock market value of $3 trillion. That\u2019s about eight Walmarts, ormore than the value of the entire German stock market.\nAmazon is so consequential in the U.S. job market that the company\u2019s hourly pay has nudged local businesses to increase their rates, which has pushed upthe paychecks of many Americans who don\u2019t work for Amazon.When Facebook and its other apps blinked off briefly this fall, the outage showed how much ofour lives and commerce rely on a single company.\nThis year, American tech powers were involved inU.S. drug policies,Russia\u2019s presidential electionandethnic violence in Ethiopia. Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk \u2014 his company is not technically considered Big Tech but its stock market value and influence make it an honorary member \u2014 was recently namedTime\u2019s Person of the Year.\nThis is familiar territory to many of you. Technology is one of the most consequential forces in the world, and so are the leading lights of technology. These tech empires\u2019 combination of wealth, importance in the economy, huge numbers of users and global influence is perhaps something we\u2019ve never seen before.\nBut at the same time that Big Tech grew richer and even more consequential, there are more stresses on their empires.\nChina\u2019s government was anxious enoughabout the power of the country\u2019s tech superstarsthat it cracked down on some popular digital services. InLondon,Brussels,Seoul,Washington,Tallahasseeand \u2014 OK, just about everywhere \u2014 regulators and lawmakers are trying to erect new guardrails to control what they see as pernicious effects of tech companies\u2019 power in our lives.\nA lot of this activity might be go-nowhere bluster or ultimately prove relatively inconsequential. But when elected leaders turn against an industry, it is often a reflection of the popular mood. And it\u2019s a good bet that they won\u2019t turn sunny again soon.\nAnd while the Big Tech giants remain profitable and growing, there are signs of weakness there, too. JeffBezos stepped asideas Amazon\u2019s chief executive this year and some other tech bosses quit, too. Once a company gets big, it might be less fun tomanage the messes.\nMark Zuckerberg seems worried about Facebook and its ability tostay relevant with young people. And big ideas in food shopping during the last two years came notfrom Amazonbut from Instacart,fast-delivery start-upslike GoPuff and evenWalmart. Americans spend more on groceries than nearly anything else, and Big Tech is largely a side show.\nFeelings about tech companies and tech personalities are also growing more complicated. People often love or rely on tech, but they sometimes alsofeel yucky about it.\nThelatest obsession in the tech industryare cryptocurrency start-ups and related companies that imagine a future of the internet that would beless dominated by corporate control. This feels, in part, like a crisis of confidence about technology\u2019s foundations from inside the machine.\nEmpires don\u2019t tend to last forever, although many of the Big Tech companies have adapted tocrisesbeforeand emerged even stronger. I don\u2019t know what will happen this time. It\u2019s hard to ignore how entrenched and influential the tech empires are. And it\u2019s difficult to overlook how swarmed they are by doubts and challenges.\nA little Christmas cheer:People are (mostly)receiving deliveries on time ahead of Christmas, my colleague Niraj Chokshi reports. Savvier planning, and more spending, by retailers and delivery companies helped deal with surges in packages. And more people did holiday shopping early and in stores, which eased stress on delivery networks.\nDrones in disaster zones:The Washington Post looks at thepros and cons of small dronesthat are increasingly used to capture images of natural disasters, fill in for destroyed communications networks or search for people who need help.(A subscription may be required.)\nPeople care passionately about something on the internet. For five seconds.Fast-moving internet fads \u2014 like sea shanties on TikTok \u2014create a snowball effect of attention, says Rebecca Jennings, a writer for Vox.

Here is a collection ofpast columns.\nIf the tech predictions pan out, we\u2019ll soon be wearing computers on our faces and plugging into immersive realms of virtual people and places, perhaps blended with the real world around us.\n(I don\u2019t want to use the buzzword \u201cmetaverse\u201d here, because ugh. This term from science fiction has been applied to anything and everything that we should just callthe internet. But that\u2019s partly what I\u2019m talking about.)\nI am both apprehensive and excited about the potential next generation of technologies that may further blur the lines between computers and us, and between online and real life. I can get into the idea of glasses that let mescroll restaurant menu itemsand feel as if the sizzling burger is in front of me, or into headgear that lets meexercise next to a virtual lake in Patagonia.\nNo one can predict how long it might take this imagined future of the internet to come true and go mainstream,if it ever does.But if computers on our faces and more lifelike digital realities are coming for us, let\u2019s start thinking through the implicationsnow.\nI don\u2019t have a fleshed out good humans\u2019 guidebook for the metaverse. (Ugh, that word again.) But I know that instead of letting Mark Zuckerberg or the Apple chief executive Tim Cook decide on the etiquette, ethics, norms, rewards and risks of our potential brave new world of technology, we need to do it.\nHow we use technology shouldn\u2019t be left to the companies that dream up electronics and software. It should be up to us, individually and collectively. That can happen by deliberate thought and careful design, or by the lack of it.\nI\u2019m writing this now because Applereportedlyplans tointroduce its first computers for the facein the next year or so.\nApple appears to imagine that its face computers \u2014 similar toMicrosoft\u2019s HoloLens, Snap\u2019sexperimental Spectaclesor thefailed Google Glass\u2014 will blend virtual images with the world around us, sometimes called \u201caugmented reality.\u201d Imagine watching a fix-it video of a car engine while a guide overlays diagrams on the fan belt that you\u2019re trying to repair.\nApple has a reputation for making up-and-coming technology go mass market. We\u2019ll see, but it\u2019s clear that there will be a lot ofactivityandattentionon face computers and immersive technologies in all forms. (Counterpoint: Some tech experts have predicted the rise of face computers formost of the past decade.)\nWhat I want all of us to do \u2014 whether we don\u2019t get the fuss over virtual reality or love it \u2014 is to begin deliberating over where we want to focus the promise of this technology and limit the risks.\nI\u2019m mindful of what has gone wrong when we allowed technology to wash over us and tried to figure out the details later.\nPartly through an unwillingness or inability to imagine what could go wrong with technology, we have websites and apps thattrack us everywhere we go, and thatsell the information to the highest bidders. We have carmakers that sometimes protect us with clever tech that helps offset human frailties, and other timesseem to exacerbate them. We have the best aspects of human interactions online, and the worst.\nWe should think about this stuff now, before we might all be wearing supercomputers on our faces.\nWhat dowewant from this technology? Can we imagine schools, offices orcomedy clubs in virtual reality?What do we want from the next generation of immersive internet for our kids? Do we want to drive while our headgear flings tweets into our fields of vision? Do we even want toerase the gap between digital life and real life?\nIt might be misguided to establish norms and laws around technologies that might take many years to become big. But tech companies and technologists aren\u2019t waiting. They\u2019re molding their imagined future of the internet now. If we don\u2019t engage, that puts the companies in the driver\u2019s seat. And we\u2019ve seen the downside of that.\nWith the holiday season upon us, we want to hear from our readers about the new ways that you\u2019re using technology (apps, social media, websites, gadgets or more) to help you plan your travel, parties, shopping or family time. Tell us about an app or site you use during the holidays and what makes it helpful, or the tech you stopped using and why. We may publish a selection of the responses in an upcoming newsletter.

        "title": "Apple can delay changes to App Store rules, appeals court says.",
        "fulltext": "A federal appeals court delivered a last-minute reprieve to Apple on Wednesday, agreeing to the company\u2019s request to delay a legal order requiring it to make policy changes to its App Store that could help app developers circumvent what they say are unfair fees.\nIf the appeals court had not ruled, Apple on Thursday would have had to start allowing companies to include links within their apps directing customers to outside websites where they can pay for those companies\u2019 services or subscriptions. That would have prevented Apple from taking a cut of up to 30 percent on those transactions.\nThe order was initially made in September as part of theverdict in a yearlong court case between Apple and Epic Games, the creator of the popular video game Fortnite. Epic sued Apple, accusing it of engaging in anticompetitive behavior that harmed developers and consumers through its fees and strict App Store rules.\nIn a brief document, three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that Apple could wait to make any changes until the appeals process for the Epic lawsuit concluded, which could take more than a year.\nThe ruling adds another wrinkle in a lengthy legal battle over whether app developers have the right to inform their customers about ways to pay for their services outside the App Store.\nAfter athree-week trialin May, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland ruled largely in Apple\u2019s favor, saying the tech giant was not a monopolist.\nBut she did say Apple was violating California competition law with its so-called anti-steering provision, which blocked developers from telling their customers about ways to pay outside the App Store. Judge Gonzalez Rogers ordered Apple to drop the anti-steering rule by December.\nAppleappealed the verdictin October and requested a stay of Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s injunction about the anti-steering rule until the appeals process played out. Shedenied the company\u2019s requestin November, but the federal appeals court disagreed with her.\n\u201cApple has demonstrated, at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court\u2019s determination that Epic Games Inc. failed to show Apple\u2019s conduct violated any antitrust laws but did show that the same conduct violated California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law,\u201d the judges on the appeals court wrote. They added that Apple had also \u201cmade a sufficient showing of irreparable harm\u201d to the App Store if it was forced to make policy changes.\nIn a statement, Apple thanked the appeals court and reiterated its argument against tweaking its strict App Store rules. \u201cOur concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store,\u201d the company said.\nEpic Games declined to comment.\nWith Wednesday\u2019s ruling, Apple bought some time, but it could ultimately have to comply with Judge Gonzalez Rogers\u2019s order if it loses on appeal."

        "title": "About 20 Apple stores are now closed as the Omicron variant surges.",
        "fulltext": "Apple said on Monday that about 20 of its retail stores were closed because of a wave of Covid-19 cases among employees that had left the stores unsafe and understaffed.\nA handful of stores in Washington State also closed because of storms, the company said.\nSome of the stores had been closed as a precautionary measure to protect employees and customers from being infected; others were closed because not enough healthy employees were available to remain open.\n\u201cWe regularly monitor conditions, and we will adjust our health measures to support the well-being of customers and employees,\u201d Amy Bessette, an Apple spokeswoman, said in a statement, adding that workers were tested regularly.\nApple employees have been increasingly frustrated with their work environment as the Omicron variant has fueled a surge of cases around the country. On Christmas Eve, several dozen Apple workerswalked out of storesto demand better pay, more sick leave and better working conditions.\nThis month, the companyscrapped its planned February return-to-office datefor white-collar workers, saying the new return date was to be determined based on virus conditions."

        "title": "Four Resolutions for a Healthier Tech Life in 2022",
        "fulltext": "The coronavirus pandemic has been packed with plenty of nasty tech surprises.\nWe ran into the problem of aperpetual scarcity of hardware, likegame consolesand graphics cards. Apple this year announced a major change to its data practices, including a tool toscan iPhones for child pornography, whichcritics labeled an invasion of privacy. And many of us who tried ordering high-quality face masks to protect ourselves from the coronavirus had to swim through an ocean of fakes.\nYet there was a silver lining to all this: valuable lessons to improve our relationship with tech for years to come, like becoming savvier online shoppers and taking control of our personal data.\nThink of it as New Year\u2019s resolutions, but for tech. Here are my top recommendations.\nThe pandemic, which drove many white-collar professionals to work from home, showed how many of us had sluggish internet connections. That underlined how little we tend to invest in our tech infrastructure, like the networking equipment and broadband services that power the internet connection for our devices.\nWhen people spend on technology, they generally buy gadgets before all else. Electronics like video streaming sticks were among the top-selling items on Black Friday, according to aresearch report published last month by Adobe.\nBut we should spend on infrastructure before devices. One-fifth of consumers hold on to their routers for more than four years, according to a survey this year fromConsumer Reports. That\u2019s cutting it close, since we should upgrade our Wi-Fi routers every three to five years, wireless experts say. New routers introduce new Wi-Fi standards that improve speeds and techniques to mitigate network congestion, making it easier for multiple devices throughout a home \u2014 like laptops and game consoles \u2014 to get a robust internet connection.\nIf your router is fairly new and your connection remains subpar, look to your internet service provider. The broadband plan you subscribed to many years ago may no longer be sufficient, so consider investing in a faster plan. If your household streams lots of video and plays games online, shoot for roughly 40 megabits a second.\nIf you tried buying a high-quality face mask online in the pandemic, you probably ran into a fair number of fakes. Counterfeiters have flooded the market with poorly constructed masks, aproblem that still persiststoday.\nWhile fake goods online have long been a problem, the pandemic has made the issue potentially life-threatening with masks. Amazon and other retailers have policies to ban sellers of fake masks, but new sellers with phony masks constantly emerge. It has become a game of whack-a-mole.\nThe lesson? Always vet before you click the buy button. Read buyer reviews. Check the seller and if it\u2019s an unknown brand, research its reputation. Some online tools likeFakespotcan scan a product page to look for signs of phony products and fake reviews.\nBe especially careful when buying anything that can affect someone\u2019s health, including vitamins and dog food. When in doubt, buy these goods at a reputable brick-and-mortar store.\nApple, which has long portrayed itself as adefender of digital privacy, delivered one of the year\u2019s biggest tech surprises.\nIn August, the companyannounceda software update with a twist. The software included a tool to scan iPhones for code linked to a database of known child pornography. Once a number of matches were detected, an Apple employee could review the photos before informing the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\nApple\u2019s positive intent of preventing child abuse imagery from spreading was quickly overshadowed by theinvasive implicationsof its content-flagging system, which ran counter to the company\u2019s pro-privacy image. In response to the backlash, Apple postponed the software feature\u2019s release and clarified that the technology could be disabled if people opted out of backing up their images to iCloud.\nThe episode was a reminder that when we use cloud services, our data is at the whims of a tech company. The lesson? We should consider changing how we manage our data so that we are more independent of the big companies and their cloud services.\nTaking a hybrid approach to our data is the best way forward, security experts advised. That involves backing up our data to the cloud but also storing it on devices like physical drives and miniature USB sticks. Having such a local backup ensures that you have access to important files even if there\u2019s an internet outage. And if you become unhappy with a cloud service or get tired of paying subscription fees, you have an easy exit because you already have a copy of your information.\nOnly 17 percent of people take the hybrid approach, according to Acronis, a data protection firm. Don\u2019t procrastinate: The longer you wait to create local backups of your data, the harder it is to pull it out of a cloud service if you decide to leave.\nLast month, many shoppers who tried snatching up deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday quickly learned there was something amiss.\nMany items that we typically buy at a discount, like new Wi-Fi routers and cheap laptops, were either not on sale or out of stock. That was largely the result of a global chip shortage anddisrupted supply chains, which have snarled manufacturing and the shipping of items around the world.\nWaiting until Black Friday to splurge hasrarely been wise,but the pandemic-induced scarcity has made this clearer than ever. All year round, deals often emerge that are just as good \u2014 and sometimes better \u2014 than the promotions on Black Friday.\nThe tricky part is knowing when the cool stuff is cheaper. There are many ways to scout for discounts, like following sites that alert you to sales. Our sister publicationWirecutter tracks dealson its Twitteraccountand website, for example.\nAutomated tools likeCamel Camel Camel, a website that lets you plug in products sold on Amazon and set up email alerts for a price drop, can also help track promotions for specific items. In the future, you can get ahead of the holiday shopping frenzy and potentially skip Black Friday."
