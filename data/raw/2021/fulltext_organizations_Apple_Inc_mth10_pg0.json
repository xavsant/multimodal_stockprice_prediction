        "fulltext": "Shares of Snap, the parent company of the social media app Snapchat, tumbled more than 20 percent on Friday, a day after the company released quarterly results that fell below its guidance for the quarter by $3 million.\nRevenue for Snap\u2019s most recent quarter was $1.067 billion, a 57 percent increase from the same period last year.\nSnap said its business had been affected byrecent privacy changes in Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating systemthat prevented tracking by some advertisers. The company said that it had expected some disruption from the changes but that the challenges for advertisers had been more severe than expected.\nThe company said it was building new tooling and measurement solutions for advertisers to adapt to Apple\u2019s privacy changes.\nAdvertisers were also under pressure from the pandemic and supply chain disruptions, which limited their spending, Snap said.\nShares for other social media companies also fell on Friday, with Facebook sliding more than 5 percent and Twitter dropping nearly 4 percent. Facebook is expected to report its financials on Monday, followed by Twitter on Tuesday.\nSnap said its daily active users continued to grow. The company reported 306 million active users in the quarter, a 23 percent increase from the previous year. Snap lost $72 million, in the period, a 64 percent decrease from the previous year.\n\u201cWe\u2019re now operating at the scale necessary to navigate significant headwinds, including changes to the iOS platform that impact the way advertising is targeted, measured, and optimized, as well as global supply chain issues and labor shortages impacting our partners,\u201d Snap\u2019s chief executive, Evan Spiegel, said in a statement."

        "fulltext": "A leader of an activist movement within Apple said she was fired by the company on Thursday.\nJanneke Parrish, who was a program manager for Apple Maps based in Austin, Texas, and one of the two leaders of a group that called itself #AppleToo, had been on suspension for several days whileAppleinvestigated her activities. On Thursday, she said, an Apple lawyer and a human resources worker told her on a phone call that she was being fired.\nThe reason, Ms. Parrish said she was told, was that she had deleted files from her company computer and phone before handing them over to be examined. She said she had deleted files that contained personal and financial information.\nMs. Parrish, 30, said she believed Apple was retaliating against her for helping to organize the activist group. In recent months,Apple employees have uncharacteristically spoken outand said the company\u2019s culture of secrecy \u2014 meant to prevent product leaks\u2014pervaded other aspects of the company and discouraged workers from coming forward about issues like sexual harassment and wage disparities.\n\u201cI knew from the moment that I started speaking that this was a risk, and a significant one,\u201d Ms. Parrish said. \u201cIf me getting fired helps bring justice to people who have been seeking it, then it\u2019s a sacrifice I\u2019m happy to make,\u201d she added. Ms. Parrish\u2019s firing wasreported earlier by The Verge.\nApple did not directly address Ms. Parrish\u2019s status with the company. \u201cWe are and have always been deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace,\u201d said Josh Rosenstock, an Apple spokesman, in a statement. \u201cWe take all concerns seriously and we thoroughly investigate whenever a concern is raised and, out of respect for the privacy of any individuals involved, we do not discuss specific employee matters.\u201d\nAn accompanying email notifying her of her termination, viewed by The New York Times, said Apple had \u201cdetermined that you engaged in conduct in violation of Apple policies including, but not limited to, interfering with an investigation by deleting files on your company provided equipment after being specifically instructed not to do so.\u201d\nMs. Parrish said she had deleted innocuous screenshots of things like programming bugs she was working to fix off her computer desktop before handing it over. She said she also deleted the Robinhood stock trading app because she did not want Apple to see \u201chow much money I lost investing in GameStop\u201d and the Pokemon Go gaming app because \u201cI feel a little embarrassed I played Pokemon Go.\u201d\nShe said she was investigated because company officials thought she had leaked a recording of an Apple staff meeting to the media, which she said she did not do.\nMs. Parrish had also been publishing a weekly digest of accounts of workplace problems shared anonymously with her by Apple employees. She said she had received hundreds of the stories over the last few months, though she could not confirm that everyone who submitted a story was an Apple worker.\nBeing fired, Ms. Parrish said, would not make her end her activism. \u201cI don\u2019t intend to stop until there\u2019s justice,\u201d she said."

        "title": "Google Pixel 6 Review: Playing Catch-Up With the iPhone",
        "fulltext": "For half a decade, Google, the maker of Android, the world\u2019s most widely used phone software, has had a dream to make a best-selling phone that rivals the gold standard,the iPhone.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel phones have consistently received positive reviews but sell tepidly because of a major weakness: They have relied on off-the-shelf parts from other companies. As a result, they have felt sluggish compared with devices made by Apple, which tightly controls the quality of its iPhones by doing design in-house.\nWith the newPixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which cost $600 and $900 and will be available on Thursday, Google believes it now has phones that level the playing field.\nThese are the company\u2019s first phones to includeTensor, its own computing processor, similar to how Apple designed the silicon that powers its iPhones. The Tensor chip enables the Pixel phones to rapidly perform complex computing tasks, like voice transcriptions, Google said.\nAfter a week of testing, I concluded that Google has made serious progress with the Pixels \u2014 but it is still dreaming. Its advancements were not enough to make me switch froman iPhone.\nThe new Pixels feel zippy, but their computing power lags behind the iPhone\u2019s speeds by as much as 50 percent. And while many photos produced with its camera looked clear and well lit, some looked overly sharp. The Pixel 6\u2019s ability to immediately translate languages into one\u2019s native tongue also felt unfinished \u2014 it didn\u2019t work well with some languages, like Japanese.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\nThe Tensor processor is the result of Google\u2019s long and expensive journey in smartphone technology, which included a$1 billion acquisition of the handset maker HTCin 2018. To speed things up, Google embedded its most complex algorithms into the chips, including advanced photography effects and language translation, eliminating the need to connect to its online servers to complete those tasks.\nThe speed increases were noticeable. The Pixel 6\u2019s motion looked buttery smooth, compared with that of its predecessors, when scrolling through apps and websites. But when I tested some of the phone\u2019s special features, like the ability to watch a foreign-language video and display subtitles translated into English in real time, the results were mixed.\nWhen I opened TikTok and searched for videos of people giving language lessons in French, Italian and Japanese, the technology performed well with French and Italian. The software correctly translated casual ways to say \u201cI am not\u201d in French (pronounced \u201cshwee pah\u201d as opposed to the more formal phrase \u201cje ne suis pas\u201d).\nBut it struggled with Japanese. One TikToker demonstrated a basic conversation that, when properly translated, meant the following in English:\n\u201cToday is tiring.\u201d\n\u201cYes, the workload is a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s true. Well, see you.\u201d\n\u201cYes. See you tomorrow. Thanks for the good work.\u201d\nThe Pixel 6\u2019s translation came out like this:\n\u201cI\u2019m tired today.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I had a lot of work.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. See you soon.\u201d\n\u201cThank you for your hard work tomorrow.\u201d\nThat translation probably would have earned a C in a Japanese language class.\nThese results weren\u2019t surprising. The Pixel software said that for translated captions, Japanese was in \u201cbeta,\u201d meaning it\u2019s a work in progress. In another sign that this feature was incomplete, I wasn\u2019t able to test translated video captions for Mandarin speech, which I\u2019m somewhat fluent in, because the Pixel has yet to support Chinese.\nPixel phones have always relied heavily on a blend of software, artificial intelligence and machine learning to produce clear and vibrant photos. The Tensor chip, Google said, would help the camera software take photos more quickly.\nTo test the new cameras, I took the Pixel 6 devices and two of the latest iPhones to a park on an overcast day to shoot hundreds of photos of my corgi, Max (who now holds the record as the most featured dog in The New York Times).\nThe Pixel 6 and 6 Pro\u2019s cameras were fast, just as advertised, and many photos looked great, with realistic colors and nice shadow detail.\nYet the Pixel 6 photos often looked like the phones were trying too hard with more advanced effects. In some photos shot in \u201cportrait\u201d mode, which sharpens a subject in the foreground and gently blurs the background, my exceptionally cute dog looked overly sharpened to the point that he looked much older. The iPhone 13 Pro produced a more aesthetically pleasing portrait of Max, who is 8 years young.\nOften, the colors of the Pixel 6 photos also looked too \u201ccold,\u201d making Max\u2019s white mane appear blue. The color temperature could be adjusted in the camera software, but the iPhone cameras generally produced photos with more natural colors without any extra effort.\nAll told, the Pixel camera was very good. Zoomed-in shots looked clear on the 6 Pro, the more expensive model, which has an optical zoom lens.\nGoogle was the first phone maker to introduce the ability to take photos in low light without using a flash, and the new Pixels still excel in this area. When comparing them with low-light shots taken with the new iPhones, I\u2019d call it a tie.\nIn the end, the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro are solid products. Considering their starting prices, which are about $200 lower than competing high-end phones from Samsung and Apple, I can recommend them to Android fans.\nBut what will Google do with Tensor to make the Pixel stand out? Not only are parts of the software unfinished, but the parts that the phone excels at aren\u2019t all that special.\nThe ability to transcribe foreign languages, for one, is useful, but it\u2019s also something that older phones can do. When I visited countries like Thailand and Japan in years past, taxi drivers communicated with me by using Google\u2019s Translate software \u2014 they spoke into their phones and played the English translation out of the speaker. It worked with some delay, but it was adequate.\nYou might enjoy other benefits of Google\u2019s shift to its own silicon. Battery life in the new Pixels is much longer than in past models \u2014 after each long day of testing, plenty of juice was still left by bedtime. But again, this is not a differentiator from other modern phones that have equally long battery life.\nGoogle\u2019s competitors also have nice exclusives. Most notably, there\u2019s the \u201cblue bubble\u201d effect, or iMessage, on iPhones. Over the years, Google has gone through several iterations of messaging apps, and none have been as seamless and enjoyable to use as iMessage.\nThat special something \u2014 something sticky, delightful and ubiquitously useful \u2014 is what Google needs to deliver to get hordes of people to switch to a Pixel. It\u2019s hard to tell what that might be."

        "title": "Apple Appeals App Store Ruling in Fight With Epic Games",
        "fulltext": "Apple asked a federal appeals court on Friday to throw out a legal decision that would require the tech giant to tweak its strict App Store rules and force it to allow app developers to inform customers of ways to pay for subscriptions and services outside the App Store.\nTheSeptember verdict followed a yearlong legal battle between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of the game Fortnite. Apple also asked a judge to delay the ruling mandating App Store changes until after the appeal is heard.\nChanging its rules too quickly,Appleargued, \u201cwould upset the careful balance between developers and customers provided by the App Store, and would irreparably harm both Apple and consumers.\u201d\nEpic declined to comment on Apple\u2019s action on Friday.\nAt the heart of the fight between the companies is the power Apple wields over its lucrative App Store. The App Store generates $20 billion a year, by some estimates, and its business model requires developers that distribute their apps on iPhones to pay Apple up to 30 percent of their sales.\nCalling the fees and other App Store rules unfair, Epic accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior and took the tech giant to court in May, but the judge, Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, ruled that Apple did not have a monopoly in the mobile games market.\nStill, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said Apple had violated California\u2019s laws against unfair competition by prohibiting app developers from steering their customers to payment services outside the App Store.\nUnder longtime App Store rules, companies were not allowed to tell people who used their apps that they could visit those companies\u2019 websites or other locations to pay for services. The judge gave Apple 90 days to change its rules and allow developers to start advertising alternative payment methods.\nOn Friday, Apple asked the judge to consider its request, called a stay of injunction, on Nov. 2, in hopes that it will be granted a delay until the appeals process with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, is finished. The company said that could take at least a year.\nEpic, also unhappy with aspects of the judge\u2019s decision, appealed the verdict shortly after it was delivered.\nStill at issue is the question of what exactly Apple would be forced to change if the injunction was upheld. Some have speculated that developers could go as far as offering their own competing payment methods within the App Store, but Apple said Friday that it \u201cdisagrees with this broad interpretation\u201d of the judge\u2019s ruling.\nThe company said it had already done some of what Judge Gonzalez Rogers wanted by agreeing aspart of a settlement in August to allow developersto use email and other methods to communicate with their customers about alternative payment methods.\nThe legal battle began in August last year when Epic tried to direct Fortnite players around Apple\u2019s payment methods, promptingApple to boot Fortnite from the App Store. Epic sued, and the two companies met in May in a courthouse in Oakland, Calif. Apple recently rejected Epic\u2019s request to reinstate its developer account and return Fortnite to the App Store.\nThe dispute was followed with keen interest by the tech industry, as Apple is facing accusations of anticompetitive practices and calls for regulation around the world, from Japan and South Korea to the European Union and Congress."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Most Back-Ordered New Product Is Not What You Expect",
        "fulltext": "OAKLAND, Calif \u2014 Apple this month unveiledan array of new gadgets: more powerful MacBook laptop computers, AirPod wireless headphones with longer battery life and HomePod Mini speakers in three more colors.\nBut a different and unheralded Apple release is garnering so much interest that it has become the company\u2019s most back-ordered new product: a $19, 6.3-by-6.3-inch cloth to wipe smudges and fingerprints off screens.\nThe cloth, imprinted with the Apple logo in the corner, is made with \u201csoft, nonabrasive material\u201d to clean the screens of iPhones, iPads and MacBooks \u201csafely and effectively,\u201d according to theproduct page. The listing adds that the Polishing Cloth \u2014 capital P, capital C \u2014 is \u201ccompatible\u201d with 88 different Apple products. For most U.S. shoppers, shipment is delayed until Jan. 11, at the earliest.\nCharging $19 for a piece of cloth about the size of two stacked dollar bills is bold even by Apple\u2019s standards, a company whose legions of loyal customers are conditioned to stomach steep prices. AnApple-branded set of four wheelsto \u201cimprove mobility\u201d for the Mac Pro, the company\u2019s most expensive desktop computer, is priced at $699, for instance.\n\nBut the Polishing Cloth stands out because it is far more expensive than widely available alternatives. MagicFiber, a popular brand of microfiber cloth that uses ultrafine fibers to clean glass without scratching the surface, offers a pack of six for $9 on Amazon.\n\u201cYou have to give them credit for the chutzpah to charge $19,\u201d Walter Gonzalez, president and founder of Goja, the parent company of MagicFiber, said of Apple.\nEven so, the price has not stopped Apple fans from rushing to be early adopters.\nAlbert Lee, 47, a director at a consulting firm in New York, said he bought the cloth at an Apple Store on Tuesday. He was picking up a new MacBook Pro, a high-end laptop computer, when the Polishing Cloth caught his eye. He bought four and then posteda picture of his bountyon Twitter.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a point of sheer excess,\u201d Mr. Lee acknowledged, calling the splurge an impulse buy of \u201cthe most elite cloth.\u201d He added: \u201cI just spent $4,000 on a laptop. What\u2019s another $19?\u201d\nOn Twitter, the cloth has beenfodder for jokesand even a parody account since Apple quietly put it on sale on Oct. 18. Later that week, when Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, posted a tweet promoting a new retail store in Turkey, Elon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive,needled him by replying, \u201cCome see the Apple Cloth\u201d with a trademark logo.\n(Mr. Musk\u2019s company is also not shy about testing the strength of its brand and the fealty of its customers. Tesla\u2019s website offers a company-branded\u201chandblown\u201d decanterfor $150 anda $60 umbrellawith an \u201cergonomically designed handle.\u201d)\nTechnically, the cloth is not a new product. Apple had previously provided it free for customers who bought one of its high-end monitors, Pro Display XDR. The $5,999 display has a special type of glass that reduces glare, but may scratch if wiped with a conventional cloth. Apple said it designed its own cloth for that special glass and decided to sell the product separately when some customers asked to buy extras.\nAn Apple official said in an interview, based on the condition that The New York Times not quote or identify her, that the company was not surprised by the demand for the Polishing Cloth. The official said the cloth was very effective and had been designed to be special, including a custom light gray color. Apple said the cloth was made of a nonwoven microfiber but declined to elaborate.\nFederico Viticci, editor in chief ofMacStories, a website dedicated to Apple news and apps, said he initially thought the Polishing Cloth was a joke.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been cleaning my iPhone screen and my iPad screen with the cloth that comes with my eyeglasses or my T-shirt, or a paper towel like normal people,\u201d he said.\nBut Mr. Viticci, who is based in Italy, said he ended up buying the Polishing Cloth because \u201cI kind of realized the meme potential here.\u201d His tweets about the product have since gotten hundreds or thousands of likes and retweets, with subscribers to his site asking for exclusive cloth photos.\nPatrick Tomasso, 32, a Toronto-based YouTube creator of tech and photography-related videos, said he also thought that Apple charging $25 Canadian dollars for the cloth was \u201cridiculous\u201d since many tech products include a microfiber cloth free.\nBut when he noticed that it was not shipping until next year, he said he got a \u201cbit of FOMO\u201d \u2014 fear of missing out \u2014 and quickly snapped up two sheets from a nearby Apple store. As a spoof, Mr. Tomasso then made an \u201cunboxing video\u201d of himself opening the \u201cmost revolutionary Apple product.\u201d\nIn the video, he noticed that the Polishing Cloth\u2019s color looked different in person \u2014 more gray, less white \u2014 and that there was a big crease in the middle that might need to be ironed.\nHis assessment? It\u2019s a nice cloth worth maybe $5.\n\u201cI probably would not buy it again but I like the fact that I own one,\u201d Mr. Tomasso said. Then he paused and added, \u201cBut I hate that I like that I own one.\u201d"

        "title": "The True Cost of Upgrading Your Phone",
        "fulltext": "Let\u2019s talk about buying an iPhone for $1,000.Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, once compared this eye-popping price tagto buying a cup of coffee a day over a year. No big deal, right?\nBut financial advisers see this differently. By some estimates, an investment of $1,000 in a retirement account today would balloon to about $17,000 in 30 years.\nIn other words, $700 to $1,000 \u2014 the price range of modern smartphones \u2014 is a big purchase.Fewer than halfof American adults have enough savings set aside to cover three months of emergency expenses, according to the Pew Research Center. Yet one in five people surveyed by the financial websiteWalletHubthought a new phone was worth going into debt for.\nTech companies fairly argue that our smartphones are our most powerful tools for work and play and thus worth every penny. But they also play numbers games to downplay the costs of a new phone. Samsung, for example, has said the price of its new Galaxy phone is $200 \u2014 but that\u2019s only if you trade in a year-old phone for credit toward the new one. The true price is $800.\nSo it\u2019s worth looking at phone upgrades in a different light to weigh their financial impact. That can help us make well-considered decisions so that the move isn\u2019t automatic.\nThe irony of Mr. Cook\u2019s coffee analogy isn\u2019t lost on Suze Orman, the financial adviser who once famously equated people\u2019s coffee habits to \u201cpeeing $1 million down the drain.\u201d The seemingly small amount of money that people mindlessly spend on java \u2014 and now phone upgrades \u2014 could be a path to poverty, she said.\n\u201cDo you need a new one every single year?\u201d asked Ms. Orman, who hosts the\u201cWomen and Money\u201dpodcast. \u201cAbsolutely not. It\u2019s just a ridiculous waste of money.\u201d\nApple and Samsung didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nSo what\u2019s the true cost of a phone upgrade? Let\u2019s look at the math.\nFlipsy, a company that buys and sells used phones, published an analysis this year arguing thatit\u2019s smart to buy a new iPhone every year. Here was its breakdown:\nThe iPhone 12 cost $799 last year. It\u2019s now worth $460 if you trade it in to defray the cost of a new phone. The newest iPhones, the iPhone 13, also cost $799. So if you traded in your iPhone 12, the iPhone 13 would cost $339. At this rate, if you bought an iPhone every year for four years, including the original $799, the net total would be $1,816.\nIf you waited three years for the iPhone 15, your iPhone 12\u2019s trade-in value would diminish to about $200. Trade it in and the cost of the iPhone 13 would be $599. Add in the original $799 and your net cost over four years would be $1,398.\nIn summary, upgrading annually over three years costs $418 more, or roughly $12 a month, compared with upgrading every three years, Flipsy said.\nFramed this way, it may sound like a bargain to get a new phone every year as opposed to every few years. But plugging these numbers into a financial calculator tells a different story.\nIf you put $12 a month into a retirement account, like a Roth I.R.A. that has an average annual rate of return of 10 percent, that amount would turn into $25,161 over 30 years, according toMs. Orman\u2019s savings calculator.\nMs. Orman compared the trade-in dilemma to buying cars. Car manufacturers could argue that the diminishing trade-in value of your car should compel you to buy a new one regularly \u2014 but don\u2019t fall for it.\n\u201cI love my car, and I don\u2019t care that the value goes down,\u201d she said. \u201cThink of the 11 years I have saved money not having car payments, or trading it in and spending more money to get another car.\u201d\nSo what about those cups of coffee? On average, we pay $3 a cup, so $1,000 could buy roughly 333 cups. But naturally, making your own coffee is much cheaper.\nI plugged some numbers into acoffee calculatordesigned by Bone Fide Wealth, a financial planning service. A $16 bag of beans from Peet\u2019s Coffee at Costco could brew about 41 cups of coffee for 39 cents each. So a $1,000 iPhone is worth about 2,500 cups of coffee. Not as compelling.\nDoug Boneparth, the president of Bone Fide Wealth, made a counterpoint. For people who have plenty of cash and are aware of the impacts of their spending, splurging on new phones could be inconsequential to their overall savings goals compared with bigger expenses like housing \u2014 and if phones make them happy, go for it. He said he sets aside cash every year to buy a new iPhone as a sort of hobby.\n\u201cPersonal finance is quite personal,\u201d Mr. Boneparth said.\nBut he acknowledged that even his hobby was beginning to have diminishing returns because new phones weren\u2019t getting much better technologically every year. \u201cThe 13 is the first one where I\u2019m like, \u2018This one literally only has a better camera,\u2019\u201d he said of the latest iPhone.\nMs. Orman cautioned that for most people who didn\u2019t have as much money in the bank, especially those in debt, the effects of a phone upgrade could snowball. A $1,000 phone charged to a credit card could turn into $3,000 with interest by the time it\u2019s paid off, she said. More debt could also affect your credit score, making it harder to buy or rent a home.\n\u201cIf you think a phone is worth going into debt for, then, oh my God, you\u2019ve now just set yourself up for always being in debt,\u201d she said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is there\u2019s nothing other than a medical expense worth going into debt for.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "Apple on Monday unveiled in an hourlong virtual event new MacBook computers powered by Apple-made processors and an updated model of its popular AirPods.\nLast year, Apple introduced a new line of computers with processors made by Apple with the assistance of a manufacturing partner, breaking its reliance on the chip maker Intel.The company said at the timethat the new chip, called the M1, would make Apple devices faster and more power efficient.\nThe new processors, the M1 Pro and the M1 Max, power a new MacBook Pro that comes in a 14-inch and 16-inch model, starting at $2,000 and $2,500. The upgraded computers will have faster processing speeds, better graphics, improved audio quality and a better camera, the company said.\nApple also rolled back some of the changes it has made to its laptops over the years, bowing to consumer demand by getting rid of the unpopular Touch Bar, a touch screen strip above the keyboard, and re-adding ports for an HDMI cable and an SD memory card.\nApple also released a third generation of AirPods with better audio quality and longer battery life, for $179 \u2014 a $20 increase from the second iteration of the product \u2014 along with a new Apple Music subscription.\nApple computers helped make the company a famous brand, but the Mac lineup \u2014 luxury devices that typically cost upward of $900 \u2014 has always been a small fry in the PC market. Last quarter,Apple computers accounted for 7.4 percentof the global PC market, far behind Lenovo, HP and Dell, which made up more than 60 percent of sales, according to the research firm IDC.\nApple\u2019s AirPods have been immensely popular since their debut in 2016. The wireless earbuds are top sellers among\u201chearables,\u201dwireless earphones with sensors that talk to phones. This year, AirPods have accounted for 57 percent of the market for high-end hearables, far ahead of Samsung, which had 17 percent, according to a report byCounterpoint Research.\nApple\u2019s announcement on Monday came just over a month after the tech giant unveiled a new line of iPhones \u2014the iPhone 13 series\u2014 an upgraded Apple Watch and a new iPad.\nAside from the hardware announcements, the company has faced increasing turmoil in recent months, including more frequent calls for regulation. Applerecently appealed a court decisionin its lawsuit against Epic Games, which accused it of engaging in monopolistic behavior, and last weekfired a leader of the #AppleToo movement, a group of employee activists."

        "fulltext": "Produced by\u2018Sway\u2019\nRepresentative Ken Buck has joined forces with the Democratic congressman David Cicilline and others to push through a package of antitrust legislation that could prove damning to companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. \u201cAs a conservative, I don\u2019t think big is bad. I think big is great,\u201d he says. But at the same time, he is quick to clarify that Silicon Valley isn\u2019t the land of \u201cbenevolent monopolists\u201d and that leaders like Jeff Bezos need to be more transparent about their business practices.\nIn this conversation, Buck discusses how he\u2019s moved further than his party on issues of antitrust, and why he \u2014 after initially backing the Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn 2020 election results in four battleground states \u2014 eventually stepped out against Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d of a stolen election.\n[You can listen to this episode of \u201cSway\u201d onApple,Spotify,Stitcher,Amazon Music,Googleorwherever you get your podcasts.]\nKara Swisher asks Buck which antitrust bills will survive big tech anti-antitrust lobbying, and whether regulatory agencies like the F.T.C. will actually have the teeth to enforce the proposed laws. They also dig into the Facebook whistle-blower\u2019s allegations, as well as conservative claims of social media censorship. And Swisher presses Buck on what he calls the \u201cvigorous debate\u201d within the Republican Party \u2014 which Buck says is happening \u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d\n(A full transcript of the episode will be available midday on the Times website.)\nThoughts?Email us atsway@nytimes.com.\n\u201cSway\u201d is produced by Nayeema Raza, Blakeney Schick, Matt Kwong, Daphne Chen and Caitlin O\u2019Keefe, and edited by Nayeema Raza; fact-checking by Kate Sinclair and Kristin Lin; music and sound design by Isaac Jones; mixing by Carole Sabouraud and Sonia Herrero; audience strategy by Shannon Busta.

        "title": "Redefining What a Smartwatch Can Do",
        "fulltext": "\u201cNine months ago I never thought I would say this, but it will never leave my wrist,\u201d John Galvin said, referring to his 51-millimeter Garmin Quatix 6X Solar.\nMr. Galvin, 38, had been a lifelong analog watch enthusiast, wearing aCasio G-Shockwith a traditional dial since childhood. Then his girlfriend surprised him with the Garmin timepiece last Christmas. \u201cI haven\u2019t even gotten past the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the Quatix can do, but it\u2019s made me a believer in the smartwatch world,\u201d Mr. Galvin said.\nAs the captain of a 70-foot Viking sport-fishing yacht, Mr. Galvin spends his days on the Atlantic, splitting his time between Nantucket and Cape Cod in the summer and Miami\u2019s South Beach neighborhood in the winter. Working as a private captain for the last 14 years, Mr. Galvin prides himself on running the most technologically advanced vessels possible. \u201cNow I have all of my electronics on my wrist at the literal push of a button,\u201d he said.\nThe smartwatch category has been around for less than a decade but, as its sales have expanded, makers including Apple, Garmin and Suunto have been redefining what a smartwatch can do \u2014 from operating a boat to changing your car\u2019s lighting.\nThe three models in Garmin\u2019s Quatix series are preloaded with apps for workouts and contactless payments. They range in price from $699 to $1,149, and offer several advances in deeper, more tailored connectivity.\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the James Bond feature,\u201d said David Dunn, senior director of marine sales at Garmin.\n\u201cYou can drive your boat with your watch,\u201d he added. \u201cNo other marine manufacturer can do what we do and connect directly into marine electronics.\u201d\nThe Autopilot Control app, preloaded on the watch, can be connected to a compatible chart plotter and then used to maintain a specific GPS route as well as to view real-time data like speed, depth, engine r.p.m. and water temperature.\nOther preloaded options, Mr. Dunn said, include what the company calls SailAssist, racing aids like a countdown timer and virtual start line, and control of an onboard entertainment system.\nExtending the use of smartwatches via connectivity isn\u2019t limited to seafaring equipment. Earlier this year, the second generation of the Mercedes-Benz User Experience, an information and entertainment system, was introduced in the automaker\u2019s new S-Class sedan, and within it, a proprietary algorithm called Energizing Coach.\nA user is told to download the Mercedes Me Connect app from the Apple or Android app stores onto a compatible Garmin smartwatch, including the branded Mercedes-Benz Venu model.\nWhen the app is linked to the S-Class\u2019s system, the smartwatch will send the user\u2019s pulse rate, stress level and sleep quality data to the car. An algorithm then uses the information to suggest changes like the color of the interior\u2019s graphic display, intensity of the lighting, temperature and audio levels, as well as recommending a massage setting for the seats.\n\u201cOne of the biggest areas of interest automakers have is using the watch as a digital key,\u201d said Kip Dondlinger, Garmin\u2019s automotive design and planning leader, \u201callowing a person to unlock or start their car and see other information about their car using the watch.\u201d\nAnd late this year Garmin, which is based in Kansas, is scheduled to deliver a branded watch designed to unlock car doors, along with other functions, to Geely, the Chinese automotive company that owns Volvo, Lotus and Polestar.\nGarmin isn\u2019t the only watch brand or technology company invested in digital vehicle keys. Apple has been working on digital key adoption with the\u00a0Car Connectivity Consortium, a cross-industry organization dedicated to advancing smartphone-to-car solutions. BMW Group became the first to use it, in 2021 models. The digital key now operates only on Apple iPhones (using iOS 13.6 and newer) and is available on select BMW models manufactured since March 2020.\nApple also has been striving to streamline travel and life at home.\nIn September, the company announced that Arizona and Georgia would be the first states to allow users to upload their driver\u2019s licenses or state identifications to the Apple Wallet on their iPhones or Apple Watches, with six other states to follow soon. And the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has said the feature will be accepted at the security checkpoints at select airports.\nLater this fall, Apple said, it also will introduce a digital home key, allowing Apple Watches to be used in place of physical keys, and for contactless check-ins at Hyatt hotels worldwide.\nSmartwatches also are being used to connect people, rather than just things.\nAs a long distance runner, Brian Wortley said he considered trail running a solo sport. \u201cI don\u2019t know many other people who want to run 30 miles at a time,\u201d he said.\nBut \u201cthe biggest thing about getting into trail running is looking at what other people are doing and how they are being creative and connecting certain routes,\u201d said Mr. Wortley, 32. \u201cThat\u2019s where the community comes in.\u201d\nAfter hiking the Pacific Crest Trail in 2012, Mr. Wortley said he developed a passion for endurance sports and the gear that accompanies them. \u201cI researched Suunto and never really looked back,\u201d he said.\nSuunto, which began in Finland 85 years ago as a field compass company, now makes sports watches, dive products and compasses.\nMr. Wortley bought\u00a0the\u00a0Suunto\u00a0Ambit 1 in 2012, moved to an Ambit 2 and then recently bought the Suunto 9 Baro. As a resident of York, Me., Mr. Wortley said he has come to rely on his watch as a lifeline because the majority of his runs are in wooded areas. A feature called the breadcrumb trail, introduced by Suunto in 2018, allows him to retrace his steps if he loses service; the storm alarm measures atmospheric pressure and issues an alert if inclement weather is approaching.\nIn other ways, the lifeline comparison is more intangible. \u201cI\u2019ve run routes, but didn\u2019t cross paths with someone in endurance sports until we connected digitally,\u201d Mr. Wortley said.\nThe company\u2019s Suunto 7 timepieces are outfitted with heat maps, \u201cwhich show the brightest heat where the most people have been doing the sport,\u201d said Markus Kemetter, a product manager at Suunto. \u201cThe difference between us and anyone else is that we have it for 20 different sports, from open water swimming to cross-country skiing, globally.\u201d\nMr. Kemetter noted that Suunto has roughly one million users contributing to the heat maps, which first appeared on watches in February 2020.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re fast hiking on super rooty and rocky terrain, and running anywhere from 10 to 15 hours, there\u2019s not always room for mistakes,\u201d said Mr. Wortley, noting, \u201call my data is on my watch, and data is really important to me.\u201d"
