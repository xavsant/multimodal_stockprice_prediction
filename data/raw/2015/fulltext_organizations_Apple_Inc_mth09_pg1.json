        "title": "When Is a Lease Not a Lease? When It\u2019s an iPhone",
        "fulltext": "APPLE is offering a new way for consumers to purchase iPhones, and while the company is calling the new system a \u201cfinancing\u201d plan, it is essentially a lease. The idea is to get people to constantly trade in their one- or two-year-old phones for the newest models. And Apple is employing a tactic similar to one that luxury carmakers use to get more people driving Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs, Audis and Lexuses that they could otherwise not afford to buy: creating a monthly payment that is appealingly low.\nTrue, Apple\u2019s plans \u2014 starting at $27 a month to buy a phone over two years, or $32 a month to upgrade a phone every year \u2014 lessen the pain of paying for a $700iPhone. Added onto a monthly cellphone bill that probably tops $100 or $200 already, the charges may seem slight.\nBut, of course, these relatively small charges not only accumulate, they never stop, adding one more perpetual charge to consumers\u2019 monthly bills. Why not simply buy something as utilitarian as a smartphone, especially since new iterations offer only incremental changes for the average user? For that matter, why lease a car as basic as a Chevrolet Malibu \u2014 now $99 a month according toSwapalease.com, an online lease broker \u2014 when you could buy a quality used car?\nAccording to consumer experts, economists and analysts, there are both smart and superficial reasons to lease anything.\nOn the superficial side, a cynic could dismiss leasing a smartphone or a luxury car as just another example of racing to keep up with the Joneses. Some people crave the newest thing. Others judge their self-worth by what they have and how they are perceived by peers.\n\u201cBrands are offering this option to consumers who don\u2019t have the lump sum available for the upfront cost,\u201d said Andrea Woroch, a consumer finance and personal savings expert. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost about taking advantage of consumers. They can have this fake luxury lifestyle.\u201d\nBut by now, most people know that. There is also a more concrete reason not to lease something: It costs more over the years of the lease. Ms. Woroch said that if people waited a few months, they could probably buy the newest phone at a lower price, or they could buy a refurbished model of the previous iteration for a few hundred dollars.\nThe Apple plan also seems more expensive than getting an iPhone through a cellular carrier, which will generally charge a lower down payment and build the rest of the phone\u2019s cost into the monthly payment. Now, someone on the Apple plan could essentially be paying twice \u2014 first for the phone, and then for the portion of the phone\u2019s cost that is embedded in a monthly bill.\nWith cars, which will have a residual value and still be usable after three years in the way a smartphone might not be, the cost of leasing is higher than the cost of financing. But that is where the psychology of leasing comes into play. Car companies make sure that the monthly lease payment is always lower than a monthly financing payment.\nThat difference is the key to the popularity of leasing luxury cars, said Bob Shullman, founder and chief executive of the Shullman Research Center, which tracks luxury consumer spending. \u201cLeasing cars did not come from the mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cIt had to do with when you financed a luxury car over the short term, the number was too big. There was a negative backlash.\u201d\nIn other words, on some level you know that you will eventually pay more later, but focus on the payments that are lower now.\nThere are upsides to leasing.\nOnce you own a car, for example, you are responsible not only for maintaining it but also for finding a buyer when you ultimately want to sell it.\n\u201cEven if the cost of ownership is lower, the time it takes to resell the car and the uncertainty of what you can get is not worth it for some people,\u201d said Jessie X. Fan, a professor in the family and consumer studies department at the University of Utah who has studied the thinking behind leasing and buying.\n\u201cFor some people, when these other costs are considered, they will make leasing look better,\u201d she added.\nAnd if that vehicle is leased through a person\u2019s business, the lease payments can be deducted as an expense against income for tax purposes.\nScot Hall, executive vice president ofSwapalease.com, said that typically 50 to 80 percent of luxury cars were leased.\nAnother advantage to leasing is not having to worry that a car may break down or suddenly cost more to maintain.\n\u201cThe benefit of leasing a car is you get a new version on a schedule, you pay a constant price and, in general today, the lease includes maintenance because the companies realized if they didn\u2019t include maintenance, they get the cars back wrecked after two or three years,\u201d Mr. Shullman said. \u201cDo you get the residual value? No. But it all depends on how important it is for you to have something new.\u201d\nOthers see advantages to leasing outside of the luxury brands. \u201cAll the benefits of leasing a luxury car also apply to your more standard or basic transportation \u2014 your Chevys, your Fords, your Toyotas,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cOne thing people like about leasing is you can get more car than your monthly payment would typically allow.\u201d\nHe gave the example of a Honda Accord, which a consumer might be able to afford as a basic model. With a lease, the buyer could upgrade to the top-of-the-line model, with a nicer interior and larger engine. Given that a car loan can now stretch to six or seven years, the three years of a car payment allows the buyer to change cars sooner, he said.\n\u201cFrom the younger generation, they treat their car payment like a cellphone payment \u2014 they expect to have car payments and not have it go away,\u201d Mr. Hall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way for people to budget their money for their transportation needs.\u201d\nHe said that in addition to the Chevrolet Malibu ($99 a month), there were 10 other makes leasing for under $200 a month.\nThere are other instances in which a leasing model seems to make financial sense. Rent the Runway allows women to lease gowns for special events for 5 to 16 percent of the gown\u2019s value, depending on demand. It has five million members and expects to lease close to $1 billion in clothing this year.\nOur customers \u201cknow that when they wear something that is emerald green or burgundy, it\u2019s likely the case that they\u2019ll wear it less frequently,\u201d said Jennifer Hyman, co-founder and chief executive of Rent the Runway. \u201cAt least with a black dress or a pair of jeans, you can wear it many times and redecorate it.\u201d\nSo instead of paying $6,000 for a gown, she said, someone could rent it for $600 and get a second size sent along in case the first one did not fit.\nThe company has another model akin to the original Netflix system of sending users new DVDs after they returned the old ones. For $99 a month, a woman can have three pieces of clothing and change them out as often as she likes. In this case, the customers are typically choosing clothes for work. (The company does not cater to men, Ms. Hyman said, given their propensity to wear clothes in basic colors for years.)\nBut back to the Apple plan. While it is certainly to the benefit of the company\u2019s production team to know how many phones will be coming off lease in any given month, consumers also stand to benefit from scheduled upgrades.\nThis offer \u201cplays into the firm\u2019s strengths,\u201d said Devavrat Debu Purohit, a professor of marketing at Duke\u2019s Fuqua School of Business. \u201cWhile there is still a market for a three-year-old car or a five-year-old car, a five-year-old phone doesn\u2019t actually work that well. A one-year-old iPhone still works.\u201d\nHe speaks from experience: When his teenage daughter broke her phone, he gave her an old iPhone 4S he had around the house.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating, but it\u2019s not because the phone itself has deteriorated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have the memory to work. It\u2019s very slow.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "With the rise of digital devices that tell time, track your steps and even pay the dinner bill, it would seem that the demise of the mechanical watch would be fast approaching. But in fact, high-end timepieces are doing just fine. Last year, Switzerland exported a record $24.3 billion worth of them (which says nothing of the equally booming vintage business). And while the Apple watch, which launched in April and sold an estimated 2.5 million units in its first quarter, is likely to affect those numbers, most traditional producers are taking their smart competition in stride. After all, they survived the ravages of the 1970s, when quartz technology made 60,000 watchmakers obsolete. Indeed, the Swiss are in the midst of a horological renaissance in which dedicated collectors wait years \u2014 and pay millions \u2014 for timepieces that make up for their lack of digital functionality with analog elegance and a promise: Given regular servicing, they\u2019ll run in perpetuity."

Can I buy a headset and microphone combo that will let me talk to her? If so, what type and where and how will I plug it in to my PC?\nA.If your desktop computers did not come with microphones, you should still be able to commandCortana, Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10customizable virtual assistant, with an external or headset microphone. First, though, confirm thatCortana is enabled in the Windows 10 settingsand that neither PC came with a microphone. Go to the Windows 10 search box in the lower-left corner of the screen, type in \u201cManage audio devices\u201d and open the settings box from the results list. Click the Recording tab and see if a microphone is listed.\nIf you have a microphone listed, go back to the Search box, type \u201cSet up mike,\u201d and when the \u201cSet up a microphone\u201d option appears, select it and follow along. If the process works, Cortana should hear you. (Microsoft\u2019s website hastroubleshooting tips for general sound problemsif you do not hear any audio.)\nNo luck \u2014 or no microphone \u2014 on either PC? Depending on your computer hardware, you can either buy an external microphone or a headset-microphone. Prices can be as low as $10, but you typically get better audio quality if you pay a bit more.\nMicrophones can connect to eithera dedicated microphone jackon the computer or an available USB port, so where you connect the new hardware depends on the type of microphone or headset you buy. Once you have the mike connected, follow the instructions that came with it (or use the Windows 10 setup option mentioned above) to configure it.\nQ.How do I find out if my iMac can upgrade to the next version of OS X?\nA. OS X 10.11, also known asEl Capitan, arrives Sept. 30 and should run on any Mac that can handle the current OS X 10.10 Yosemite system. According toApple\u2019s upgrade guidefor Yosemite, you need an iMac from 2007 or later to use El Capitan and be runningMac OS X 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)or later.\nTo see information for your particular iMac, go to the Apple menu in the top-left corner of the screen and selectAbout This Mac. Your current version of OS X is displayed, and if you do not see a model year listed for your Mac, click the More Info button.\nTIP OF THE WEEKYouTube\u2019s list of similar videos (displayed next to the one you are watching in your computer\u2019s browser) can keep you entertained for much longer than you probably anticipated \u2014 especially because the site\u2019sAutoplayfeature will start playing the next clip in the list automatically unless you pause or stop the process with the on-screen controls. If you find that the Autoplay function is a little too convenient (or inconvenient, if you are watching videos on your work computer), you can turn it off.\nLook for the blue Autoplay button above the Up Next list on the right side of the screen and click the switch to Off. You can also disable Autoplay from the video window itself, even in full-screen view, by clicking the cog-shaped Settings icon in the lower-right corner of the window and clicking the button next to Autoplay. Later, if you want to let Autoplay resume control of your video viewing, reverse the steps to enable the feature again in the YouTube settings."

        "title": "Find Out What Apple\u2019s New iPhones and iOS Can Do",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s newest iPhones are hitting store shelves this week. Many millions of older iPhones and iPads are also getting an upgrade, as the latest version of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system, iOS 9, is now available.\nWhat apps should you load on your new mobile device \u2014 or your updated iOS device? We have some ideas.\nFor some simple gaming fun that shows the power of Apple\u2019s new hardware and software, tryAir Wings. Thisfree appputs you in control of a paper plane flying around various hazardous situations. You rotate the phone to control the plane, flying it around to pick up rewards and weapons to use against others\u2019 planes.\nThe clever part comes when you turn on Apple\u2019s AirPlay feature and stream data to an Apple TV. At that point, the game shows two views. On the phone screen you see the player\u2019s point of view. But on the TV you see a \u201cspectator view,\u201d which offers a different perspective on the gaming arena, allowing observers to say helpful things like \u201cIt\u2019s behind you!\u201d\nAir Wings is easy to learn and great fun to play alone or with live opponents over the web.\nA $3 app,Duet Game, shows another feature of iOS 9. Duet is anabstract gamewith simple graphics in which you maneuver colorful playing dots through fast-moving barriers and obstacles. It\u2019s the kind of game that sounds silly but is addictive. And with iOS 9, you can now tap on an icon and record your in-game exploits as a movie, then quickly edit and share it over social media.\nSome of the most popular apps being downloaded by iOS 9 users belong to a new category in the App Store: content blockers. These act when you surf the web, blocking the kind of behind-the-scenes code that websites use to track your online movements to serve you advertisements.\nPurify,for $4, is perhaps the simplest app in this category, with an unfussy interface. By using the app you can turn off advertisements and ad trackers, and also prevent websites from using external fonts and images (which have to be downloaded and can slow your browser). To \u201cwhitelist\u201d or unblock a favorite site, you tap an icon in the sharing panel in the Safari browser, making the site work as normal.\nThe app seems to work smoothly and I find it speeds up browsing. But it\u2019s worth remembering that blocker apps are controversial. Many websites rely on income from advertisers to create and deliver the content you enjoy, and ad blockers limit what is shown. It\u2019s also odd that you would pay for an app that prevents other businesses from making money.\nThe Night Skyis one of my favorite apps, and it\u2019s even better in iOS 9. The app is a virtual reality guide to the stars: You hold your phone up to the sky and the app calculates what you can see overhead, then displays it with interactive graphics on the screen.\nOn compatible iPads, Night Sky supports the device\u2019s new multitasking feature, so you could use Night Sky in one window and do a search for more information on, say, Jupiter, in the other window. It also connects to Apple\u2019s newSpotlight searchsystem, so you can search for stars, constellations and so on from outside the app, and then activate the app when you find something you like.\nFor Apple Watch OS 2.0, released earlier this week, Night Sky is even more clever than before. It offers powerful features like the ability to explore the sky view on your wrist, and it gets alerts when the International Space Station is going to fly over. It\u2019s entertaining, educational andjust $1.\nThe news appFlipboardis a great way to keep on top of what\u2019s happening in the world because it aggregates all the news you know you are interested in from multiple sources.The appessentially grabs news items from many news sites and presents them in a neat digital magazine format, rich in images. You control how the magazine is built because you can tell the app, for example, that you prefer to see tech news instead of political news.\nIn iOS 9, Flipboard has gained deep search powers. This means that with just a quick swipe from the home screen you can search for relevant news topics inside Flipboard without even opening the app. Flipboard even has Apple Watch integration, sending the top 10 news stories you may be interested in to your wrist for quick consumption. Best of all, Flipboard is free.\nFor those of you interested in business productivity apps, check out Readdle\u2019s $10PDF Expert 5, which is all about reading and annotating the kind of PDF file that is often shared between businesses. PDF Expert is nowiOS 9 compatible, so on iPad you can edit PDFs alongside other apps, perhaps using them as reference material. And don\u2019t forgetMicrosoftOffice apps, which you may be surprised to hear are rather good on iOS 9, supporting all the multitasking you can do on iPads, including the coming iPad Pro. Downloading apps likeExcelandWordis free for iPhones.\nLara Croft Gois a reimagining of the classic Tomb Raider games, placing the heroine, Lara Croft, in a new type of gaming environment: Instead of an arcade adventure, this new app is a turn-based puzzle game. It has excellent graphics, is lots of fun and may really tax your brain. It\u2019s $5 oniOS,AndroidandWindows."

        "title": "Apple Improves the Watch, Slightly",
        "fulltext": "The Apple Watch has been on sale since the spring, and like all Apple products, it has been the subject of intense speculation, criticism, fawning and doomsaying. Expect all of it to accelerate, because on Monday Apple is releasing the first major upgrade of the watch\u2019s operating system. The new software had been scheduled for release last week, but Apple postponed the rollout at the last minute because of an unspecified bug. That bug has now been fixed.\nI\u2019ve been using the new version for almost two weeks. The watch\u2019s hardware remains unchanged; all the upgrades will be delivered via an update to watch owners. Here is my assessment.\nThe watch is still probably not for you.Apple has made some small and useful improvements, but it\u2019s unlikely that any will alter the overall reception of the device. This is still a product of limited utility for most people.\nAs Iwrote in April, I like the Apple Watch. I still wear it daily. I use it mainly for the quick access to digital notifications \u2014 incoming texts, tweets, email and reminders about the next meeting. Also, I use it to tell the time (it is, after all, a watch). The problem, as every critic has noted, is that a variety of other devices, most obviously your smartphone, already provide this information. The watch may give you access to the flood of notifications with added speed and panache, but it does not do much that you would not be able to do otherwise, and nothing in the new software changes that.\nSo if you liked the watch before, you\u2019ll like it a bit more after this upgrade. If you didn\u2019t see the need for the device, you still won\u2019t.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean the watch is doomed.As I argued in July, it\u2019s too early to tell if the watch will become a hit because all new major Apple product introductions tend to follow a familiar script. The iPod, the iPhone and the iPad were all criticized for being too expensive and not very useful in their earliest days; only after steady, incremental improvements over a period of years did they become entrenched in the culture. (The tech industry is stilldebating the success of the iPad, five years after its introduction.)\nIn that sense, then, it\u2019s not a surprise that the new software isn\u2019t revolutionary \u2014 it\u2019s in the nature of these updates that they\u2019re more incremental than overhauls. What\u2019s important, though, is that Apple is figuring out what the watch is for and experimenting with some new ideas that may ultimately prove quite novel.\nSome of the new features reflect Apple\u2019s emerging understanding about how people use the watch. For instance, the company didn\u2019t anticipate that people would want to reply to email using their watches, so the first version let you only read email. Now that\u2019s fixed; as with texts, you can respond to email by voice dictation or with a set of canned responses.\nIn other features, you can begin to see the outlines of something bigger. The first watch was almost totally dependent on the phone for connectivity. The device can now connect directly to Wi-Fi networks that you have already registered with, meaning that you can use some watch apps and, depending on your carrier, possibly make phone calls even when your phone isn\u2019t around. It\u2019s not quite an independent device, but you can see Apple preparing for such a future.\nIt\u2019s slightly faster.The original Apple Watch was criticized for being a little lethargic. The interface often took half a beat too long to respond, and sometimes the whole interface just hung up. You\u2019d tap to open the Weather app, wait, wait, wait and then get tired and reach for your phone.\nThe new software makes this slightly better. Now, apps live on the watch \u201cnatively\u201d \u2014 that is, they can store and process data using the watch\u2019s hardware, while in the past they relied on the phone for everything. For me, this change resulted in a slight but noticeable increase in speed in the watch\u2019s Weather and Maps apps, and it will probably appear soon in other apps, too (once they\u2019re updated by developers). In the Weather app, tapping between different interface elements resulted in instant changes, without delay. This doesn\u2019t sound like much, but when lots of developers update their apps, many tiny speed increases will likely add up to a more pleasant experience.\nIt\u2019s much prettier.Apple is now selling a few new combinations of watch cases and bands, including gold and rose gold cases in the cheapest Sport edition, which starts at $349. The designer label Herm\u00e8s is also creating its own editions of the watch; these versions include Herm\u00e8s watchbands as well as a special Herm\u00e8s digital watch face that matches the design of the Herm\u00e8s analog watches. The overall effect is to make the watch more striking, and, in the case of the Herm\u00e8s cases, so pretty it seems wrong to call it a gadget.\nI wore the gold Sport watch with a new bright orange band, and at least a half-dozen people complimented me on the combination \u2014 the first time I\u2019ve noticed any interest in my Apple Watch since its introduction.\nThere are some fun bells and whistles.Apple added a couple of new watch faces that show pictures from your phone each time you look at your wrist. I loved them \u2014 it\u2019s endearing to see pictures of my children on my wrist. The Maps app now has transit directions in a few large cities; if you\u2019re in one of them, the upgrade is handy. And you can now send multicolored sketches to other people who have watches. In the past, you were limited to one color.\nNow if only you could find someone else who has one."

Shareholders would berelying on a legal-opinion letterfrom the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom reassuring them that the transaction\n                                                    would be tax-free.\nButif it isn\u2019t tax-free, it will be \u201ca blood bath,\u201dVictor Fleischer writes in the Standard Deduction column.\nYahoo would face a tax bill of about $7 billion on distribution of Aabaco to its shareholders \u2014 thesame tax bill it would have faced had it sold the underlying Alibaba stock.\nYahoo shareholders would not recognize dividend income equal to the fair market value of the Aabaco shares they received. They also would not receive any cash in the distribution. Some of themmight have to sell the newly received Aabaco shares to pay the tax bill.\nYahoo has protected itself with a line in Aabaco\u2019s registration statement, which saysAabaco will pay back Yahoofor any taxes that Yahoo has to pay as a result of the failed transaction. To\n                                                    cover the $7 billion tax bill, Aabaco might sell a third of its Alibaba stake or borrow the amount using the Alibaba stock as collateral.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a simple way for Yahoo to avoid paying taxes on the appreciation of its stake in Alibaba,\u201d Mr. Fleischer notes. \u201cIt would probably be better off\n                                                    selling the stock, paying the tax, distributing what\u2019s left to its shareholders and letting its management get back to concentrating on the core business.\u201d\n\nVOLATILITY BUFFERS MAY HAVE DEEPENED MARKET TURMOIL|Investment strategies that promise to insulate investors from risk are being\n                                                    seen as acontributor to the wild market swings in recent weeks,Landon Thomas Jr. reports in DealBook.\nInvestments aimed at avoiding falls in the market have boomed in popularity after global central banks pumped trillions of dollars into asset markets in a bid to spur economic growth. Now experts warn that\n                                                    the sums that flowed into so-calledrisk-parity funds and exchange-traded funds, or E.T.F.s,over the last five years have become so large that they have created a riskier, more volatile market.\nRisk-parity funds have used leverage to reduce the exposure that portfolios have to stocks, which tend to be more volatile, byloading up on emerging market and high-yield bonds. The idea is to give\n                                                    investors equitylike returns without the volatility and concentration risk that comes from making a big bet on stocks.\nE.T.F.s track an index linked to an investment style (stocks, bonds or commodities for example), but trade on exchanges and promise the investor instant liquidity and transparency. Trading in E.T.F.s now\n                                                    accounts for close to20 percent of total volume for stocks in the United States.\nIn the latest wave of market turmoil, bonds that were supposed to provide stability to investor portfolios havedeclined along with stocks. Central banks in China and other Asian countries, which\n                                                    for years have been large buyers of United States Treasury securities, have started to sell out of these positions to defend their weakening currencies.\nAs many of these bonds arecore holdings in E.T.F. and risk-parity portfolios, the downward pressure has been amplified.\nThere is about $4 trillion tied up in these investment strategies and the fear is that as their returns suffer,a wave of investor selling will start a wider market routas managers struggle to unload\n                                                    high-yield, high-return bonds and equities alike.\n\n3 NOMURA TRADERS CHARGED|A government investigation into Wall Street bond trading practices has led tocharges against three traders who worked in New York for the Japanese financial firm Nomura,Peter Eavis reports in DealBook.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission accused the three men ofmisleading customers about bond prices so they could earn illicit profits.\nDeirdre M. Daly, the United States attorney for Connecticut, also announcedcriminal conspiracy and fraud chargesagainst the men, Ross B. Shapiro, formerly Nomura\u2019s head trader of mortgage-backed\n                                                    bonds in New York; Michael A. Gramins; and Tyler G. Peters.\nA lawyer for Mr. Gramins said his client had done nothing wrong: \u201cThis is acase that is not even on solid legal ground, given that several Court of Appeals judges have asked serious questions\n                                                    about the government\u2019s theory.\u201d\nEven if the government loses, money managers might welcome law enforcement efforts, which could help them get better deals from brokers. Themarkets for certain bonds have long lacked clear prices,\n                                                    making it hard for investors to know whether they are getting a fair price.\nBrokers make money by buying bonds for less than they sell them; the difference is known as a spread. A broker canartificially widen that spread by exploiting the ignorance of the investors on both sidesof the trade. The S.E.C. contends that this happened in deals brokered by the Nomura traders.\nOther banks, including JPMorgan Chase, have said that law enforcement agencies are looking into their bond trading practices.\n\nON THE AGENDA|Data onjob openings and labor turnover for Julywill be released at 10 a.m.Applewill unveil new\n                                                    products at an event in San Francisco at 1 p.m.\n\nMEDIA GENERAL TO BUY MEREDITH CORPORATION|The Meredith Corporation, a magazine publisher and owner of television stations, has\n                                                    agreed to besold to its competitor Media General for $2.4 billion,Michael J. de la Merced reports in DealBook.\n                                                    Meredith started off with a single magazine, Successful Farming, at the turn of the 20th century, but now it is being sold on the strength of its television operations.\nThough perhaps best known for publications like Better Homes and Gardens, Meredith\u2019stelevision stations have enjoyed better growth. The local media division increased its sales by 32 percent\n                                                    in the 12 months ended in June, to $534 million. Its print magazine unit, by contrast, saw sales dip by 1 percent, to $1.1 billion.\nThe combined company will be known as Meredith Media General and will be one of the largest owners of broadcast network affiliates in the United States, with 88 stations in 54 markets. The companies said\n                                                    that together, they wouldreach about 30 percent of American television households.\nMeredith has alreadyexplored a more television-focused strategy. It held discussions with Time Warner more than two years ago that fell apart because of concerns about the fate of publications like\n                                                    Time and Sports Illustrated. Media General has already sold the bulk of its newspapers to Warren E. Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. It followed that move with transactions like the takeover of LIN\n                                                    Media last year, growing its television network to 71 stations.\nAn arms race to consolidate is already underway within the television industryas content providers, station operators and cable companies try to gain negotiating leverage.\nThe deal may have beenwell timed to catch a surge in political advertising spending for the 2016 presidential campaign, with the combined company owning stations in swing states like Florida and\n                                                    Ohio.\nThefate of Meredith\u2019s print publicationsmay ultimately lie in a sale or a spinoff, according to a research note by Marci Ryvicker, an analyst at Wells Fargo. Meredith\u2019s chief executive,\n                                                    Stephen M.

        "fulltext": "Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky often says that he campaigns where \u201cother Republicans aren\u2019t,\u201d like Detroit, Alaska, and, well, on a smartphone.\nThe Paul campaign is releasing a smartphone app on Wednesday through the Apple and Android stores, one of the few official campaign apps of 2016 aside from one from Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. It tries to offer\n                                                a blend of digital mischief and communication that has come to be a hallmark of Mr. Paul\u2019s online campaign.\nIn addition to offering calendar events, campaign news and a featured video, the app lets users post their own Rand Paul memes or create an artificial selfie with the senator to share on social media. And if\n                                                they know where to tap, they can find an \u201cEaster egg\u201d hidden game, a version of the 1978 arcade classic \u201cSpace Invaders\u201d that features Mr. Paul\u2019s torch logo shooting rockets\n                                                at other campaigns\u2019 logos, blasting Donald J. Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and Jeb Bush\u2019s \u201cJeb!\u201d into pixelated embers.\nA common criticism of campaign apps is that they speak only to the converted; there\u2019s no point in persuading a user who\u2019s willing to download an app.\nBut there is use in reaching out to that base. Mr. Paul\u2019s app will send push alerts when the senator is hosting an event in the area, and notify users when he is about to vote on a bill in the Senate,\n                                                asking his followers how they think he should vote.\n\u201cYou have a reason to download it because you can influence what happens,\u201d said Ron Schnell, the chief technology officer of the Paul campaign and architect of the app. \u201cIt\u2019s not\n                                                just to find out about the candidate you support, it\u2019s about letting the candidate know what you think.\u201d\nThe first piece of content a user sees when beginning to scroll in the app, however, is not a game or news, but rather an option to donate.\nAnd should a Trump or Bush logo blow up the user-controlled Paul liberty torch in the app\u2019s hidden game, the user is chided: \u201cYou have not defeated your inferiors! Assuage your guilt by making\n                                                a donation to the campaign!\u201d\nFind out what you need to know about the2016 presidential racetoday, and get politics news updates viaFacebook,Twitterandthe First Draft newsletter."

        "fulltext": "China reports a basket of monthly data this week that is expected to provide a clearer picture of how much its economic growth is slowing. On Tuesday, it will release trade figures for August; exports have been flat so far this year, and imports declined 15 percent in the first seven months of 2015. Other reports include inflation figures on Wednesday and industrial output, investment and retail sales on Saturday. Investors will also be watching on Monday for August data on China\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. While still the world\u2019s largest, China\u2019s reserves are expected to have declined after the surprise devaluation last month of its currency, the renminbi, which has raised concerns over capital outflows. \u2014Neil Gough\nThe Puerto Rico government is planning to complete its debt restructuring plan on Tuesday. The much-awaited plan is expected to include a moratorium on certain bond payments as well as structural changes to the commonwealth\u2019s budget. The plan has been in the works since Gov. Alejandro Garc\u00eda Padilla announced in June that the island\u2019s $72 billion of debt was not payable. The completion of the plan was postponed by about a week because the government said it was busy dealing with a tropical storm. \u2014Michael Corkery\nToyota Motor is scheduled on Tuesday to unveil the next generation of its Prius hybrid, the leader in sales among alternative-fuel vehicles. While electric cars are drawing more attention, the Prius continues to dominate the market for vehicles not powered solely by gasoline engines. The auto research firm Edmunds.com estimates that the Prius accounts for 23 percent of sales of alternative-fuel vehicles in the United States. The new model, which will be shown at an event in Las Vegas, is expected get better mileage and feature more technology, as Toyota seeks to re-establish its credentials as an innovator in more environmentally friendly vehicles. \u2014Bill Vlasic\nA new era in late-night television begins Tuesday at 11:35 p.m. when Stephen Colbert officially takes over duties as the host of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on CBS. Mr. Colbert will reintroduce himself to viewers as he sheds the abrasive and satirical character he played for nine years on Comedy Central\u2019s late-night program, \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d His list of guests for the first week suggests his \u201cLate Show\u201d will be eclectic. They include Hollywood royalty (George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson), a writer (Stephen King), tech stars (Elon Musk of Tesla Motors and Travis Kalanick of Uber) and a presidential hopeful (Jeb Bush). \u2014John Koblin\nApple plans to unveil a host of new products on Wednesday at an event to be held at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in downtown San Francisco. Among the new products is a revamped iPhone, the company\u2019s most crucial product. The iPhone 6S will have a higher-quality camera and a feature called Force Touch, which lets users gain access to phone functions by pressing hard on the screen, according to people briefed on the products. An upgraded Apple TV that supports video games will accentuate Apple\u2019s desire to become a bigger presence in the living room. And Apple fans can expect updated iPads, too. \u2014Katie Benner\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England will announce its monthly decision on whether to raise a main interest rate. The Monetary Policy Committee is expected to leave the benchmark rate steady at 0.5 percent, where it has been since March 2009. After the committee\u2019s August meeting, Mark Carney, the Bank of England\u2019s governor, told reporters that the timing for the first rate increase was \u201cdrawing closer,\u201d but most experts have said they believe that the committee will not raise rates before the first half of next year. According to the minutes of the committee\u2019s August meeting, one member, Ian McCafferty, said the central bank needed to begin the process of gradually raising rates or face the possibility that it might have to increase rates \u201cmore sharply later on.\u201d \u2014Chad Bray\nThe preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey of consumer sentiment will be released Friday morning, providing an early snapshot of consumer attitudes this month. Although Wall Street does not expect much change from the final August reading of 91.9, analysts will be watching for any sign that the recent sharp stock market sell-off has made consumers more anxious. This survey has been stable this year, after a big rise in 2014 as employment rose and energy prices fell. Despite the recent market volatility, most other economic data has been relatively positive, so a big drop in consumer sentiment would catch some traders by surprise. \u2014Nelson D. Schwartz\nThe European Commission is scheduled to rule by Friday on whether it will block General Electric\u2019s $13.5 billion bid for Alstom\u2019s power business on antitrust grounds. G.E. has been negotiating with the commission for months, proposing the sale of some assets to allay competitors\u2019 fears that the proposed combination with the French company would give it too much sway over the market for heavy gas turbines. Jeffrey R. Immelt, the G.E. boss, has said that he expects to win approval, but that G.E. would agree only to remedies that maintained the commercial logic of the deal. \u2014David Jolly"
