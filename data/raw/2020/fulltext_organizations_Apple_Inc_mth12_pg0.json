        "title": "Facebook Takes the Gloves Off in Feud With Apple",
        "fulltext": "For years, signs of discord have brewed between Facebook and Apple.\nTheir chief executives, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Facebook\u2019sMark Zuckerberg, have periodically taken thinly veiled shots at each other. \u201cIf they\u2019re making money mainly by collecting gobs of personal data, I think you have a right to be worried,\u201dMr. Cook saidof companies likeFacebookin 2014. In turn, Mr. Zuckerberg hasretorted: \u201cYou think because you\u2019re paying Apple that you\u2019re somehow in alignment with them? If you were in alignment with them, then they\u2019d make their products a lot cheaper.\u201d\nBut now Apple is makingchanges that threaten Facebook\u2019s business\u2014 and the fight has intensified. Early next year, Apple plans to start requiring iPhone owners to explicitly choose whether to allow companies to track them across different apps, a practice that Facebook relies on to target ads and charge advertisers more.\nOn Wednesday, Facebook went on the offensive to forestall Apple\u2019s changes. The social networkcreated a websitethat slammed Apple\u2019s moves as potentially hurtful to small businesses. (It did not mention that the changes could hurt itself.) To reinforce its displeasure, Facebook also took out full-page ads in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times to declare that it was \u201cstanding up to Apple.\u201d\nAnd then to doubly emphasize its point, Facebook said it would provide information for an antitrust suit against Applefiled by Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, so that the court would understand \u201cthe unfair policies that Apple imposes.\u201d\nIn a blog post, Dan Levy, a vice president for advertising at Facebook, said the company was taking the steps now because \u201cwe\u2019ve heard from many of you, small businesses in particular, that you are concerned about how Apple\u2019s changes will impact your ability to effectively reach customers and grow \u2014 let alone survive in a pandemic.\u201d He added, \u201cSo we\u2019re speaking up for small businesses.\u201d\nApple executives have expected Facebook\u2019s protests and, in recent weeks, have vowed to go forward with the planned changes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s already clear that some companies are going to do everything they can to stop the App Tracking Transparency feature,\u201d Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s software chief, said in a speech last week. \u201cWe need the world to see those arguments for what they are: a brazen attempt to maintain the privacy-invasive status quo.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, in response to Facebook\u2019s public challenge, Apple said it was standing up for its users, who \u201cshould know when their data is being collected and shared across other apps and websites.\u201d The company added that Facebook did not need to stop tracking users or creating targeted advertising, but that \u201cit simply requires they give users a choice.\u201d\nThe escalating tensions are part of an unusual, high-stakes battle between two of the world\u2019s most valuable companies, which rely on each other and exert tremendous influence over digital behavior.\nAt the heart of the fight is how Facebook and Apple are diametrically opposed on how they make money \u2014 and which company wins out is likely to help shape the internet for years to come. Apple prefers that consumers pay for their internet experience, leaving less need for advertisers, while Facebook favors making the internet free for the public, with the bill footed by companies that pay to show people ads.\nThe fracas is also a reminder of both companies\u2019 power over the internet, as well their leverage over each other. Facebook needs its appsto work on Apple\u2019s devicesto reach hundreds of millions of people. And Apple needs Facebook\u2019s apps \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger \u2014 to make its devices worth their high price tags. That precarious relationship has underpinned their larger fight, with both careful not to do anything to blow it up.\n\u201cAll of this is a long time coming,\u201d said Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, a tech-research firm in Silicon Valley. \u201cA lot of the privacy moves that Apple has made over the past few years, in terms of allowing people to understand what\u2019s happening to them in the background, a lot of it has to do with Facebook.\u201d\nMr. Cook and Mr. Zuckerberg have long made clear their distaste for the other\u2019s philosophies on advertising, targeting and privacy.\nIn 2018, scandal engulfed Facebook over the news that the voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica hadharvested the Facebook dataof more than 50 million people. When Mr. Cook was asked on national television what he would do if he were Mr. Zuckerberg,he replied, \u201cWhat would I do? I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201d He added that it was beyond time that Facebook was regulated.\n\u201cWe could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer \u2014 if our customer was our product,\u201d Mr. Cook said, referring to Facebook\u2019s business model. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected not to do that.\u201d\nMr. Zuckerberg responded bycallingMr. Cook\u2019s comments \u201cextremely glib.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you.\u201d\nThen the fight went beyond words. Last year,Apple became upsetwhen Facebook bypassed the iPhone App Store process to distribute an app that paid users $20 if they allowed the app to snoop on their online activity. In response, Apple temporarily blocked some iPhone apps that Facebook employees used to message each other, catch shuttle buses around Facebook\u2019s campus and check the cafeteria menu.\nThat power that Apple wields over which apps appear on iPhones and how they work is now at the center of antitrust probes against the company. And Facebook was again at the receiving end of that clout this year when Apple blocked its new Facebook Gaming app from distribution in its App Store.Apple rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, citing its rules that prohibit apps with the \u201cmain purpose\u201d of distributing casual games.\nAt the time, people close to Facebook said that Apple\u2019s moves may have been influenced by how Facebook Gaming appeared to compete with Apple\u2019s own sales of games.\nThen in August, Epic sued Apple, accusing the company of violating antitrust laws byforcing developers to use its payment systems. On Wednesday, Facebook signaled that it was on Epic\u2019s side, saying it was \u201ccommitted to providing relevant information in the Epic Games litigation regarding how Apple\u2019s policies have adversely impacted Facebook and the people and businesses who use our services.\u201d\nAll the while, the two companies have sparred over data and privacy. In June, Apple flexed its muscles over the issue, this time with a potential long-term effect on Facebook\u2019s business.\nThat was when Apple announcedchangesto iPhone software that would blunt the ability of companies like Facebook to collect data on iPhone users. The changes included enabling people to share their approximate location, instead of a precise one, and adding easy-to-read summaries to the App Store on what data each app collects.\nMost concerning for Facebook, however, was a change that would require iPhone owners to grant apps explicit permission to track them across different apps. Under that policy, most people would probably block Facebook from collecting such information. Facebook uses such data to build robust profiles of its users that it then markets to advertisers.\nAnalysts said the change would probably have a limited impact on Facebook\u2019s main ad business, as it already knows plenty about its users\u2019 interests from their activity on Facebook and Instagram. But they said it could hurt Facebook\u2019s efforts to sell ads in other places around the internet. Facebook\u2019s enormous trove of user data is also one of its most valuable assets.\n\u201cWhat could be at stake is some future business that Facebook thinks is the next big thing that they can\u2019t get without this data,\u201d Mr. Bajarin said.\nFor now, Apple and Facebook hardly compete, save for some limited areas, like Facebook Portal, a screen that Facebook sells for video chatting. But both companies are working toward what many in Silicon Valley believe is the next big thing in computing \u2014 augmented reality, or a way to mix digital images into a person\u2019s view of the real world \u2014 and analysts expect that race to put them on a collision path.\nBy the time it publicly blasted Apple on Wednesday, Facebook had already taken a shot at its frenemy this week, on Monday. When authorities in Europe were preparingnew proposalsto regulate tech companies, including a measure to require more transparency on ad targeting, Facebook responded with a statement saying it welcomed regulation \u2014 but wondered why the regulators had not taken aim at Apple, too.\n\u201cApple controls an entire ecosystem from device to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm developers and consumers,\u201d the company said, \u201cas well as large platforms like Facebook.\u201d"

        "title": "Goliath vs. Goliath",
        "fulltext": "Facebook grew to be one of the world\u2019s largest companies by gathering up large quantities of personal data and auctioning them off to advertisers. Now that Apple is posing a threat to that business, Facebook has embarked on a quixotic marketing campaign against its rival that it says is really about saving small businesses.\nIt\u2019s more like Goliath versus Goliath.\nApple, maker of the iPhone, has drawnFacebook\u2019s ireover a plan to require app users to choose to opt in to the kind of data collection and tracking that can produce creepily specific ads, known as targeted advertising. Apple plans to apply the change early next year, which is likely to result in fewer dollars flowing to companies like Facebook. That\u2019s because targeted ads are sold at a premium over general-interest ones, like for Coca-Cola.\nWithout any meaningful federal privacy laws, it has been left to the companies themselves to determine how customers\u2019 data should be handled, which has led to today\u2019s enormous \u2014 and self-serving \u2014 personal-data collection regimes. There are virtually no limitations on how companies may track Americans\u2019 online behavior and gather information about them. The companies do this so that advertisers can sell people everything from insurance plans to basketball shoes \u2014 typically without people\u2019s knowledge of the sophisticated manipulation taking place behind the curtain.\nFederal lawmakers in the past couple of years have proposed a variety of data privacy bills, none of which has yet advanced. California has the most expansive laws, granting consumers the right to know whether their data is being sold or provided to other companies, but also the right to block companies from selling it.\nDispleased with Apple\u2019s planned changes, on two days this week Facebook took outfull-page adsin newspapers (including The New York Times) and rolled out awebsitewith testimonials from small-business owners about how Apple could hurt its ability to reach specific customers.\nThe dispute centers on a new prompt on Apple devices that will ask users whether they want to allow companies to track them across multiple apps. You\u2019ve probably seen similar pop-ups for location data collection \u2014 though Apple soon will give users the option to provide their approximate location, rather than a precise one. Also, app makers would be required to provide easier-to-understand descriptions in Apple\u2019s App Store about what data is collected and how it is used. There would, however, be no new limitation on Facebook or others to serve up targeted advertising based on demographic and other data they collect inside their own apps.\nFacebook\u2019s argument is, in essence, that a company simply cannot successfully hawk its wares without knowing which potential customers spend four hours each day on cooking apps, have extended family in South Texas, visit bungee jumping sites or recently bought a computer mouse.\nRicher data on consumer spending and behavior has, of course, always been desirable. Imagine the allure of a marketing campaign that puts ads for Homer Simpson sleeping bags only in front of fans of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d during camping season. But such data collection really isn\u2019t consumer-friendly, and it\u2019s unnecessary for corporate growth \u2014\u00a0many companies in the pre-internet era somehow managed to rise from start-up to major corporation. Furthermore, it is not the consumers\u2019 job to ensure that companies have effective marketing.\n\u201cWhat this fight shows is the tremendous value your data has if two multinational corporations are willing to fight over it,\u201d said Jordan Fischer, a Drexel University assistant law professor who follows privacy issues. \u201cThe question is: Do consumers have the right to own that data, or do Facebook and Google?\u201d\nWithout comprehensive federal privacy laws, such as Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, consumers will have to hope that tech companies can responsibly lead the way. That may seem unreasonable, considering that data-led advertising helps underwrite many of the free services consumers enjoy today, like email and web surfing, but Facebook and Google are also enormously profitable and can afford a modest impact to advertising sales.\n\u201cConsumer choice is what we\u2019re for, which is why we built prominent in-app controls,\u201d a Facebook spokeswoman said. But that argument doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test. Most consumers don\u2019t take the effort to switch off data collection controls in their apps, meaning many are defaulted into it.\nWhile Apple\u2019s proposed fix is not a panacea, it would be a step in the right direction. If users want to provide more of their data to app makers, they can make that choice. It seems that most Americans would prefer to keep their every click to themselves:An August surveyby TapResearch showed that fewer than one in four respondents were likely to allow apps to track them if given the choice.\nIt\u2019s also possible, if not likely, that Apple has ulterior motives for the change. By making tracking more difficult, it could be pushing free apps toward paid services to make up for revenue lost from targeted advertising. (Apple takes as much as a 30 percent cut of in-app sales.) Or it could be working to preference its own tracking technologies that allow it to make digital dossiers based on consumers\u2019 behavior within Apple apps and services. Apple denies it has anything but consumer privacy in mind, and it has said it doesn\u2019t share that data with others.\nUntil the federal government more seriously takes up data privacy, consumers will be vulnerable to corporations that are motivated by profits to find new and creative ways to harvest personal information. Apple may have a hidden agenda behind its privacy measures, but if a result is Americans\u2019 having more control over how and where their sensitive information is used, it\u2019s a risk we should be willing to take.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "Trump Threw the Stimulus a Curveball",
        "fulltext": "Not even a day after lawmakers agreed on a$900 billion stimulus package,President Trumpcalled it a \u201cdisgrace\u201dand suggested that he might reject the heavily negotiated bill at the eleventh hour.\n\u201cIt has almost nothing to do with Covid,\u201dhe said in avideo posted onlinethat attacked the initiative on multiple fronts. He criticized the combining of the stimulus with a broader spending bill that would fund various government functions, and demanded that direct payments to Americans be more than doubled, to $2,000 from $600. That\u2019s despite the deal havingbeen negotiated by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchinand Senate Republicans havingresisted sizable direct checks.\nMr. Trump suggested that unless the funding provisions were carved out and the direct payouts increased, he would reject the package (though he didn\u2019t use the word veto).\nReactions to the threat were split:\nTrump administration officials were stunned, while lawmakers worried about the federal government shutting down on Dec. 29 if the president doesn\u2019t sign the bill. Both parties are also concerned about the politics of holding up federal aid as they prepare for runoff elections in Georgia that could determine control of the Senate.\nDemocratic leaders egged Mr. Trump on, hoping to enlist him as an unlikely ally in providing more direct aid to Americans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosiretweeted Mr. Trump\u2019s message, adding, \u201cThe President has agreed to $2,000 \u2014 Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\nCongress could still push through the existing deal.The House and Senate each approved the bill with overwhelming majorities, meaning that they could override a veto. Lawmakers are alreadypreparing to push througha military spending bill that Mr. Trump has threatened to reject because it doesn\u2019t eliminate a legal liability shield for internet platforms.\nThis would require cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, and it\u2019s unclear how hard Democrats will push for the increased direct payouts.\nMarket futures were up this morning, suggesting that investors were shrugging off Mr. Trump\u2019s threat.\nFrance reopens its border with Britain for freight.Passage of goods between the two countrieswas allowed to resume this morningafter Britain agreed to conduct mass coronavirus testing of truck drivers. The move is aimed at relieving growing bottlenecks at British ports after the nation disclosed the growing spread of a more transmissible virus variant within its borders.\nPfizer nears a deal to sell more Covid-19 vaccine doses to the U.S.The potential agreement could providetens of millions additional vaccinations, in exchange for a government directive giving the drug maker better access to manufacturing supplies.\nThe latest in Big Tech\u2019s antitrust battles.Facebook reportedly offered tohelp social media rivalsin an effort avoid regulatory lawsuits, The Washington Post reports. (The authorities rejected the proposal.) And here\u2019s a deep dive by The Wall Street Journal into how Amazon haswaged war against rivalsbig and small as the feds investigate its competitive practices.\nCompanies can now raise money in direct listings.The S.E.C. gave the New York Stock Exchangepermission for the new rule, which bypasses the traditional I.P.O. process. Silicon Valley skeptics of I.P.O.s hailed the move: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine\u201d why any company would prefer an initial offering over a direct listing, said the venture capitalist Bill Gurley.\nLoretta Lynch will investigate a feud atop the Washington Football Team.The N.F.L.\u2019shiring of the onetime Obama attorney generalcomes as the team\u2019s majority owner, Dan Snyder, accuses a minority partner of trying to smear him in an effort to force a sale of the franchise.\nElon Musk set tongues wagging yesterday whenhe tweetedthat he had approached Apple\u2019s Tim Cook about a sale of the electric carmaker during its \u201cdarkest days.\u201d The entreaty didn\u2019t bear fruit in the slightest.\n\u201cHe refused to take the meeting,\u201dMr. Musk tweeted of Mr. Cook. Though the timing of the offer isn\u2019t clear, it may have been in mid-2017, when Tesla was struggling to produce its Model 3 cars and came within amonth of bankruptcy.\nAn acquisition then would have been a steal, according to Mr. Musk: Tesla was then at \u201c1/10 of our current value.\u201d Tesla\u2019s market cap is currently just shy of $607 billion.\nOur question: Whom else did Tesla approach for help during that time? Have any ideas?Send them our way.\nThe revelation followed news reports about Apple\u2019s own self-driving car plans,including word that the iPhone maker hopes to introduce an electric vehicle as soon as 2024. Investors don\u2019t seem to mind its overlooking of Tesla, though: Apple\u2019s shares closed up nearly 3 percent yesterday, even after Mr. Musk\u2019s tweet.\nThe Justice Departmentsued Walmartyesterday over its role in the opioid epidemic, accusing the company\u2019s network of pharmacies of ignoring \u201cglaringly obvious red flags\u201d in dispensing the drugs. The retail giant is the latest company to be blamed for a health crisisthat has killed 750,000 peopleover the past two decades.\nThe feds said Walmart knew its system for flagging questionable prescriptions was faulty.They said the retailer had ignored indicators like dosage amounts so large that, if taken as dispensed, would probably have been lethal. The company\u2019s pharmacists warned its compliance unit of a \u201cshady\u201d doctor who wrote opioid prescriptions, the Justice Department said, yet the retailer continued to fill thousands of that doctor\u2019s opioid prescriptions.\nWalmart says it was simply filling prescriptions written by authorized doctors, and that ignoring them would have put \u201cpharmacists and pharmacies between a rock and a hard place.\u201d (In October, Walmart preemptively sued the federal government, accusing regulators of trying to minimizetheir own failings in preventing the epidemic.)\nThe lawsuit is the latest effort to assign blame to corporate America for the crisis:\nDrug manufacturersincluding Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt and Insys Therapeutics have been accused ofplaying down the drugs\u2019 risks. All three filed for bankruptcy protection amid a wave of litigation, and Purdue, which makes OxyContin,pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges last month. (Members of Purdue\u2019s founding Sackler familydenied responsibilityin a congressional hearing this month.)\nDrug distributorslike McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have agreed topay billionsto settle accusations that they helped retailers circumvent limits on opioid purchases. All have denied wrongdoing.\nRetailersincluding CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid are facinga lawsuitthat accuses them of rewarding pharmacists with the highest sales volumes and promoting opioids as safe and effective. The chains themselves blamedoctors who ordered the subscriptions.\nRosemary Vrablic, the Deutsche Bank executive who was President Trump\u2019s key contact at the German lender, which arranged hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to his family\u2019s business,is stepping down.\nWhy Ms. Vrablic is leaving isn\u2019t clear.But her departure and that of a colleague, Dominic Scalzi, came as Deutsche Bank has scrutinized a $1.5 million Park Avenue apartment purchase by the two and another employee. The seller was a company linked at the time to Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law.\nThe timing is tough for Mr. Trump:\nHis ties to the lender \u2014 which was willing to work with him even while most others would not \u2014 are the subject of congressional, civil and criminal investigations that could intensify once he leaves the White House.\nMr. Trump also owes Deutsche Bank about $330 million for loans that Ms. Vrablic helped secure and that he personally guaranteed. They come due in 2023 and 2024.\nSpecial purpose acquisition vehicles arethe hottest thing in M.&A.right now, drawing in a host of unusual players. (Paul Ryan, anyone?) One of the newest isMarquee Raine Acquisition Corp., a partnership between the merchant bank Raine and Marquee Sports, a holding company run by the Chicago Cubs\u2019 owners. Its top executives tell DealBook why their $373 million SPAC is different \u2014 and why they believe it will succeed.\nThe back story:Last summer, Crane Kenney, the Cubs\u2019 president, called Raine executives about potentially forming a SPAC. Mr. Kenney \u2014 who helped the club\u2019s owners, the Ricketts family, build Marquee into a business empire with a regional sports network and real estate investments \u2014 said he had been holding talks with companies that made sense as potential investments.\nAt that time, Raine wasn\u2019t sure about the surging popularity in blank-check funds. \u201cA lot of companies that we typically talk to were still looking at it as an also-ran product,\u201d said Brett Varsov, Raine\u2019s head of M.&A. But the bank changed its mind this year, and talks to form the blank-check fund began in April. Its financing closed last week.\nMr. Kenney and Mr. Varsov are the fund\u2019s co-C.E.O.s.\nHaving a major operator onboard is a big selling point.Unlike many SPACs that rely on retired C.E.O.s as advisers, Marquee Raine will draw on Marquee Sports\u2019s 500 employees to run a business. Raine will also bring the resources of its 130-person firm, from investment banking to growth investing.\nWhat Marquee Raine is \u2014 and isn\u2019t \u2014 looking to buy:Given its partners\u2019 expertise, the fund is seeking targets in media and sports. That could include gambling and betting (Raine was an early backer of DraftKings, which went public via SPAC) plus at-home and live entertainment and health, wellness and fitness companies, Mr. Varsov said.\nWhat\u2019snoton the menu is another sports team, despiteanother SPAC\u2019s pursuitof the Boston Red Sox\u2019s parent company. \u201cI don\u2019t think they make great public companies,\u201d Mr. Kenney said, citing issues like their volatile earnings.\nDeals\nThe insurer Oscar Health, whose founders include Joshua Kushner, the brother of Jared Kushner, has filed to go public.

        "title": "Big Tech Should Try Radical Candor",
        "fulltext": "This is the last edition of On Tech for 2020. Thank you for reading, please be well and I\u2019ll see you back here on Jan. 4.\nA large part of my job is explaining the inner workings of big and powerful tech companies. I want them to put me out of a job.\nOK, not really. My rhetorical point is thatby design, mortals don\u2019t really understand thecomplex, sometimesgarbage-pronesea of independent merchants selling onAmazon. Few of us comprehend the full measure of data collected by Google and Facebook. People may not get why their iPhones keep pushing them to Apple Music.\nKnowing the messy details often isn\u2019t essential. I don\u2019t understand internal combustion engines, and I still drive.\nBut as Big Tech superpowers command more of our attention and money and shape how the world operates, it would be beneficial to us and the companies for them to be better understood. And that may mean acknowledging uncomfortable truths.\nWhen I looked this week at the newnutrition-label-like descriptionsthat Apple now requires about the data that apps collect, happy jolts fired in my brain. The labels try to communicate in plain language something that is murky \u2014 how apps track us and for what \u2014 and put that information in a prominent place.\nFacebookcomplainedabout the labels and a similar Apple feature that\u2019s intended to give iPhone owners thechoice of whether companies can track them across different apps and websites.\nFacebook said that these disclosureswould hurt businesses that buy adsbased on data that Facebook collects. It\u2019s probably right, but that\u2019s not the full truth. The company is more likely worried that if peoplegrasp all the data that it collects, they might panic and not use Facebook\u2019s apps.\nI\u2019m not sympathetic. But I would be happier if Facebook tried frank talk instead. It could explain, in detail, the trade that Facebook (and Google) are essentially asking us to make.\nWe use their apps and probably get cheaper picture-framing services or hotel rooms because Google and Facebook give businesses affordable ways to pinpoint the most receptive customers. And to do this, the companies record every hamburger we\u2019ve eaten since 2002.\nPeople do understand the generalities of this trade. But Facebook\u2019s freak out about Apple shows that it doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019re really making an informed bargain.\nWell, let\u2019s have that honest conversation. Let\u2019s hear more about these companies\u2019 products, their business models and their corporate practices.\nWhat if Amazon engaged head-on with thecriticisms that it\u2019s creating bad jobs? What if Apple justified why itcomplies with government rules in Chinathat it wouldn\u2019t accept in the United States? Not in rosy P.R. speak but in real and repeated talk in their marketing, on their websites and in other prominent spots.\nGoogle did on Thursday fairly franklysaythat it squashed competitors as it changed web search displays but that it gave us better information. Google did not say that sometimes those changes have madesearching worse for us AND it squashed competitors. It was a candid half truth, so \u2026 half credit?\nI bet you\u2019re asking why any company would illuminate its own dark corners. My answer is: to keep people\u2019s trust.\nAmericans tend to express low confidence in large institutions \u2014 particularly U.S. lawmakers and news outlets, but big tech companies are approaching a similar range, according toa recent Gallup survey.\nA loss of public confidence may be inevitable for anyone with power, and maybe people wouldn\u2019t like giant tech companies even if they understood them. But faith in Big Tech is likely to further erode with more ugly headlines and government lawsuits.\nSo why not try winning confidence with radical candor? It would feel refreshing, even if truth telling by powerful tech companies makes my job obsolete.\nBecause of aGmail outage, a number of you may not have received On Tech several days this week. We apologize. If you\u2019d like to catch up with anything you missed,click herefor all the On Tech editions online.\nI\u2019ve written before about predictions that the QVC-like shopping webcasts that are big in China aregoing to hit it big elsewhere.\nI\u2019m still not sure.\nWalmart and TikTok are going to try. On Friday, Walmart will host aone-hour live webcast on TikTok, during which some popular TikTok creators will show off clothing from Walmart. People can buy the merchandisewithout leaving the app.\nI am very curious to see how TikTok\u2019s first U.S. fashion webcast works. What else am I going to do on a Friday night in 2020?\n(Yes, this is the same TikTok the U.S. governmentsaid it would blockfrom the country. Then President Trumpnegotiated a sale out loudbetween the app\u2019s owner and anodd collectionof American companies including Walmart. And since then \u2026the deal has gone nowhere.)\nAnyway, Walmart. I swear I have heard people tout click-to-buy shopping in entertainment programming for 15 years \u2014 first on entertainment television like daytime talk shows, then on the desktop web and now in apps like Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok.\nEven though live entertainment mixed with social media and shoppingis huge in China, I\u2019m simply not sure that Americans\u2019 habits and the country\u2019s digital payments systems provide a fertile ground for this phenomenon to catch on here.\nIf you watched your favorite TikTok star do a dance-off to pitch her line of leggings, would you want the leggings enough to spend 10 minutes typing your credit card number into a tiny box in the TikTok app?\nI am prepared to be wrong about livestream shopping. Popular online stars including those on TikTok and YouTube are adept at persuading their fans to buy their merchandise from established online stores. It makes intuitive sense that they would be able to do so in live video shows or something similar. And some people will probably use digital payments or saved credit card options in the app to make shopping easier.\nBut still, I have my doubts. We\u2019ll have to watch and see.\nGood gracious, the hack keeps getting worse:My colleagues David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth reported that a computer attack by hackers believed to be working for the Kremlinstruck more U.S. government agencies and companies\u2014 and was far more complex \u2014 than investigators initially believed.\nGood games, a bad game and \u201cGrinch bots\u201d:Here are video gamesthat my colleagues played incessantly this year. Cyberpunk 2077, a much-awaited game, wasso glitchythat Sony removed it from its PlayStation store.These peopleare trying to make video gaming more inclusive and accessible. And some people aredeploying automated software, or \u201cGrinch bots,\u201d to skip ahead of online linesfor the latest PlayStation console.\nA saga for a shower curtain:After I wrote this week about theexhausting complexity of online shopping, an On Tech reader, Polly Tita, recounted her simple task gone awry. First, Polly ordered and received a shower curtain that turned out to be too small for a conventional shower. A replacement ordered for pickup from a hardware store turned out not to be in stock. Finally success came from ordering from a different hardware store. \u201cLots more time spent researching and ordering for this small purchase than our computer or TV,\u201d wrote Polly, who lives in Berwyn, Ill.\nLet\u2019s watch ahamster navigate an elaborate maze to escape from zombies.

        "title": "Big Tech Turns Its Lobbyists Loose on Europe, Alarming Regulators",
        "fulltext": "A leaked document jolted the European Union capital of Brussels in October, laying out in painstaking detail plans by Google to undermine new legislation that could severely damage its digital advertising business.\n\u201cAcademic allies\u201d would raise questions about the new rules. Google would attempt to erode support within the European Commission to complicate the policymaking process. And the company would try to seed a trans-Atlantic trade dispute by enlisting U.S. officials against the European policy, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times and confirmed by Google.\nFor many officials in Brussels, the document confirmed what they had long suspected: Google and other American tech giants are engaged in a broad lobbying campaign to stop stronger regulation against them.\nAs the European Union has become the global leader in tech regulation, these companies have increasingly focused on Brussels in hopes of choking off even stiffer rules before they spread. American lawmakers and regulators have already become much more aggressive. Last week, federal and state officials accused Facebook of illegally crushing competition. In October, the Justice Department accused Google ofillegally protecting its monopolyover search.\nIn Europe, the companies are spending more than ever, hiring former government officials, well-connected law firms and consulting firms. They funded dozens of think tanks and trade associations, endowed academic positions at top universities across the continent and helped publish industry-friendly research by other firms.\nIn the first half of 2020, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft declared spending a combined 19 million euros, or about $23 million, equal to what they had declared for all of 2019 and up from \u20ac6.8 million in 2014, according to Transparency International, a group that monitors E.U. lobbying. The spending is helping to deliver access; the companies and their allies reported hundreds of meetings with officials at the European Commission and the European Parliament.\n\u201cThe budgets are really unrivaled \u2014 we\u2019ve never seen this kind of money being spent by companies directly,\u201d said Margarida Silva, a researcher at Corporate Europe Observatory, a group that tracks lobbying in Brussels. The totals are probably much higher, she noted, because disclosure rules do not capture all the spending on law firms, academic partnerships and activities in individual countries.\nWhile the spending is less than in the United States, the growing influence industry is alarming European Union officials who believe that Big Tech is contributing to a Washingtonization of Brussels, giving money and connections an upper hand over the public interest.\n\u201cThis is a trend that has been going on for years \u2014 a professionalization of the lobbying industry in Brussels,\u201d said Max Bank, an investigator at LobbyControl, a German-based group that has been studying corporate influence.\nGoogle, Amazon, Apple and Facebook declined to comment. In public statements, all have expressed a desire to work with European officials, while voicing concerns that the proposed laws could harm innovation and the European economy. Casper Klynge, who oversees European government affairs for Microsoft, said in a statement that the European Union \u201chas been and remains an important stakeholder for our company\u201d and that Microsoft sought to be a \u201cconstructive and transparent partner to European policymakers.\u201d\nDespite the lobbying, the industry has had few major successes. European leaders like Margrethe Vestager, who oversees digital policy, have called the companies threats to democracy and anticompetitive and have taken several steps to rein them in. Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook either are under antitrust investigation or have already been penalized billions of dollars. In recent years, the European Union has adopted industry-opposed laws on issues including privacy and online copyright.\nAlexandra Geese, a German member of the European Parliament who works on digital issues, said many officials viewed the companies with suspicion. Before in-person meetings were scaled back because of the pandemic, she regularly turned down invitations from tech lobbyists to social gatherings, she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should have these conversations over a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux,\u201d Ms. Geese said.\nBut the industry does not seem deterred, even as it faces what many believe will be its toughest fight yet.\nOn Tuesday, European Union officials led by Ms. Vestager will introduce some of the world\u2019s most far-reaching technology regulations. The rules take aim at so-called gatekeeper platforms, like Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, which have an outsize role in the digital economy.\nAmong the expected changes are rules for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which is owned by Google, about moderating user-generated content. Other requirements would make companies disclose more about how services like Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s digital advertising products worked. The largest companies could be forced to share some data with small rivals. Stiffer competition rules could prevent the companies from giving their services preferential treatment over small rivals, and limit their ability to move into new product categories.\n\u201cThere is a lot to lose for the tech industry with the new legislation,\u201d Mr. Bank of LobbyControl said.\nThe laws are not expected to be approved before 2022, giving the companies ample time to influence the debate.\nIn October, the leaked document showed how Google tried to influence the European debate before a draft was even introduced. It included plans to enlist U.S. officials from embassies across Europe and in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. It suggested talking points for Google supporters, such as the risk to the economy during the pandemic.\nAfter details of the document were published by Le Point, a French magazine, many European officials expressed outrage and resolved to press ahead with the new laws. In a meeting after the leak,Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive officer, apologized to Thierry Breton, a European commissioner helping to draft the new rules.\nYet Google and its allies appeared to be moving forward with ideas in the plan nonetheless. In Washington, the Internet Association, a trade group representing Google and other tech giants, submittedcommentsto the U.S. trade representative, encouraging the federal government to \u201cact decisively and quickly in order to prevent the rapid expansion of harmful initiatives\u201d in Europe.\nTiemo W\u00f6lken, a member of the European Parliament from Germany who has been involved in the policy writing, said tech companies had allies in Brussels. After he introduced a proposal to explore a ban on targeted advertising, which would have a devastating effect on Google and Facebook, the industry worked with news publishers to get an amendment introduced to remove the wording, he said. Mr. W\u00f6lken, who has pushed for tougher lobbying rules, said he had fought off the effort by a single vote, but expects the issue to come up again.\nEuropean officials criticized the biggest tech companies for laundering their influence through groups that appear impartial. In October, the European Center for International Political Economypublished a reportthat said new tech regulations would cost the European economy two million jobs and \u20ac85 billion in lost gross domestic product. The European Center for International Political Economy is one of at least 36 trade groups, associations and think tanks that Google funds, according to Corporate Europe Observatory.\n\u201cPeople will always claim their political, academic or intellectual independence \u2014 they\u2019d reject that they\u2019ve been influenced,\u201d said Marietje Schaake, a former member of the European Parliament who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cBut the question then becomes, why are the firms spending so much money in Brussels?\u201d\nAt one influential nonprofit, European Digital Rights, Jan Penfrat recalled getting phone calls last year from Google, Facebook and others seeking cooperation and offering support soon after he took a leadership position.\n\u201cIt was like they were trying to co-opt us and get us on their side,\u201d Mr. Penfrat said. \u201cThat was the first hint and it was alarming.\u201d\nPaul Hofheinz, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who co-founded the Lisbon Council, a research group in Brussels that has faced criticism from watchdog groups for accepting money from Google, said having corporate partners ensured that research was more well rounded.\n\u201cOur views are independent. Period,\u201d Mr. Hofheinz said in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t know why these campaigning organizations think we\u2019re putzes who can\u2019t reason things out for ourselves. There\u2019s something very insulting in that idea. And very wrong.\u201d\nFew predict that lobbying in Brussels will reach the scale of Washington, where corporations and individuals face fewer restrictions to spending money on political campaigns. But European officials are seeing more signs of the influence industry\u2019s growth, including a robust commercial real estate market bolstered by the arrival of new corporations, lobby firms and think tanks.\nBefore the pandemic, Ms. Silva of the Corporate Europe Observatory offered a \u201clobbyist walking tour\u201d around Brussels, including a pass by Google\u2019s office overlooking the pond in Leopold Park.\n\u201cThe risk,\u201d she said, \u201cis we are creating a system that benefits those with the most money.\u201d\nDavid McCabe contributed reporting."

Here\u2019s thesign-up.)\nGood morning.\nWe\u2019re covering a new analysis ofBritain\u2019s slipshod pandemic spending, amove to the rightfor Emmanuel Macronand an upside tothe climate crisis for Russia.\nAs Britain scrambled for protective gear and other equipment, select companies \u2014 many of which had close connections to the governing Conservative Party or no previous experience \u2014 reaped billions, according toa New York Times analysis of more than 2,500 contracts.\nIn some cases, more qualified companies lost out to those with better political connections, which were granted access to a secretive V.I.P. lane that made them about 10 times more likely to be approved for a contract.\nConclusions:While there is no evidence of illegal conduct, there is ample evidence of cronyism, waste and poor due diligence, with officials ignoring or missing red flags, including histories of fraud, human rights abuses, tax evasion and other serious controversies.\nChristmas restrictions:Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stuck by a pledge to lift limits on gatherings from Dec. 23 to 27 despitegrowing calls toabandon the plan as coronavirus cases surge.\nHere are thelatest updatesandmapsof the pandemic.\nIn other developments:\nThe U.S. is negotiating a deal with Pfizer to producetens of millions of additional dosesof its coronavirus vaccine. Vaccinations began in the U.S. on Monday.\nThe number of severe Covid-19 cases in the Gaza Strip sharply increased, raising concerns that hospitals couldsoon be overwhelmed.\nIn the first week of Britain\u2019s vaccination program,more than 137,000 people have received shots.\nAn international team of 10 scientists working with the World Health Organization will travel next year to China toinvestigate the origins of the coronavirus.\nWith an eye on France\u2019s next presidential election in 2022, President Emmanuel Macron has tacked to the right,alienating former liberal supporters and current membersof his own party.\nAfter recent terrorist attacks, Mr. Macron pushed forward bills onsecurityandIslamist extremismthat raised alarms among some French, theUnited Nationsandhuman rightsgroups, but won favor among right-leaning voters. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally, is expected to be his main challenger.\nAnalysis:Despite his center-left origins, Mr. Macron has always been known as a shape-shifter. His slide to the right is regarded by some as a clean break from the first three years of his presidency.\nRelated:A French court found 14 people guilty ofaiding the 2015 attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo, supplying the attackers with cash, weapons and vehicles.\nGender equality:The mayor of Paris was fined nearly $110,000 forhiring too many women, under a 2012 law intended to address gender imbalance at senior levels of the country\u2019s Civil Service.\nA 9-year-old girl who died of an asthma attack in 2013 became the first person in Britain to officially haveair pollution listed as a cause of death, after she was exposed to levels of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter beyond World Health Organization guidelines.\nThe death of the girl, Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who was Black, shed a harsh light on howpollution disproportionately affects minoritiesand deprived families in Britain.\nLegal experts said it could open a new door to lawsuits by pollution victims or their families. The girl lived near a major road in southeast London. Her mother said that if she had been told air pollution was contributing to her daughter\u2019s ill health,she would have moved.\nContext:The effects of air pollution kill an estimated 7 million people around the world every year,according to the W.H.O., with 4.2 million caused by ambient air pollution.\nNo country stands to gain more from climate change than Russia, above, where warming temperatures are transforming vast swaths of formerly barren land. The spring thaw is coming earlier and earlier, while rainstorms are stronger and wetter, and the process is likely to accelerate.\nRussia hopes to seize on its newfound longer growing seasons to refashion itself asone of the planet\u2019s largest producers of food.\nChina moon mission:China\u2019s Chang\u2019e-5 spacecraft brought acapsule of rocks and soil from the moonback to Earth. The mission returned the first new cache of lunar samples since 1976.\nCoal:After months of restrictions,China has officially blocked coal importsfrom Australia, delivering a gut punch as many countries are rethinking their dependence on the fossil fuel.\nTerrorism:Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged a Kenyan manworking as an operative for the Shababwith plotting a Sept. 11-style attack on a building in an undisclosed American city.\nPortugal:The death of a detained Ukrainian man in Lisbon, after what prosecutors called \u201cinhumane treatment,\u201d hasraised questions about the country\u2019s detention policiesand has prompted calls for the interior minister to step down.\nL.G.B.T.Q. rights:More than 370 spiritual leaders from more than 35 countries signed a declarationdemanding a global ban on disputed conversion therapyand calling for an end to violence against L.G.B.T.Q. people.\nSnapshot:Above, actors from \u201cPandemonium,\u201d a new BBCsitcom on life during the pandemic.

As December winds down, it\u2019s an opportunity to take stock and to let your friends and family know how you\u2019ve been doing in this deeply strange year.Our reporter offers tipsfor creating a written playback.\nStep 1: Tell Your Story\nIf tales from vacations or group outings are in short supply this year, think of the more local adventures you experienced \u2014 like adopting a cat, exploring the city on foot, learning how to cook or taking up the mandolin. If the whole family has something to report, ask each member of the household to contribute a paragraph or two.\nStep 2: Add Pictures\nEven if travel snaps are in short supply and the 2020 school pictures are Zoom screenshots, browse your photo library for other images to visually document your year. For a year-end family portrait that includes everyone, set the camera timer so the photographer has a few seconds to jump into the frame.\nSnapshots from your walks around town, outdoor dining with friends, close-ups of the garden flowers andpet photoscan capture life as you lived it in 2020, even in a lockdown or quarantine.\nStep 3: Design Your Newsletter\nNow it\u2019s time to combine your words and pictures into an eye-catching document. If you\u2019ve never created a layout before, most word processing programs include a template gallery you can use as a starting point; Apple\u2019sPagesandGoogle Docsinclude templates.\nIn the gallery, choose a template you like and then replace the formatted sample text by highlighting it and writing (or pasting in) your own words. Tap or click in sample images to replace them with photos from your own photo library, or look for a menu option to insert new images.\nThat\u2019s it for this briefing.

        "title": "Give Virus Alert Apps a Shot",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nSome state health authorities are giving Americans the option toget notified on their smartphonesif they spent time near someone who later test positive for the coronavirus. This technology is not a magic fix, but it\u2019s a promising pandemic-fighting tool \u2014 which most people aren\u2019t using.\nMy colleagueJennifer Valentino-DeVriesrecently wrote about theeffectiveness and shortcomings of these virus exposure alert notifications. She spoke with me about what\u2019s behind the technology, and why she\u2019s comfortable with it after years of warning about privacy-invading apps.\nShira: Do these coronavirus exposure technologies work?\nJen:They\u2019re not even remotely as effective as ample virus testing with fast results, widespread use of masks and people keeping their distance from one another.\nBut the point of the alerts is to notify everyone an infected person may have interacted with as quickly as possible so they can stay away from other people and get tested. We have some data, including fromArizonaandSwitzerland, that these technologies can correctly notify those who have been exposed to infected people. If you combine effective testing, masks, contact tracing by humans and these automated exposure alerts, you can make a big impact.\n(Here\u2019s more onhow these alerts work and how to find themfor your state.)\nThen why are so few people using these apps?\nWhen I started my reporting, I thought the answer would be relatively simple: After years of privacy invasions, people concerned about the government or companies tracking them would just say no. But it\u2019s more complicated.\nCertainly some peopledistrust the government and technology companies. People are alsowary of contact tracing by humans. But a big issue is that many people don\u2019t know these apps exist, and not all states have actively promoted them.\nAnd in surveys, a significant percentage of Americans say they wouldn\u2019t use these apps even if they were 100 percent effective at stopping the pandemic and securing people\u2019s privacy.\nYou write about the creepy wayswe\u2019re tracked through our phones. Now you\u2019re saying yes to government and corporate surveillance?\nThis particular tech from Apple and Google is so well designed that I\u2019m not sure I would even call it \u201csurveillance.\u201d It isn\u2019t collecting location data or data from your contacts, and information about your network isn\u2019t stored by the government or a tech company. It relies on Bluetooth to detect which phones have been near one another for more than a few minutes. But apps that don\u2019t use this Apple and Google technology may be more intrusive.\nCalifornia rolled out itsexposure alert systemon Thursday. How does it work?\nLike a few other states, California is using the technology called Exposure Notifications Express from Apple and Google. The companies push notifications to everyone\u2019s phones to encourage people to download the health department\u2019s exposure notification app or change the phone\u2019s settings to turn on the technology.\nThe notifications make a difference. States can relatively quickly get up to 20 percent of the population to participate in the alert system, which is a good start. In states that have made their own apps without notifications or other promotions,usage tends to be lower.\nWhat are the shortcomings?\nExposure apps are most effective if people havegood access to testing and relatively rapid turnaroundfor results \u2014 within minutes or a day. That means we\u2019re back to where we\u2019ve always been in the United States, which is that there\u2019s no cohesive national strategy and testing is terrible in most places.\nWhat do these virus exposure apps tell us about technology?\nThese apps are a crazy symbol of how tech companies are supplanting government functions. Apple and Google aren\u2019t doing virus testing, but with these exposure technologies they designed the system, essentially created apps for governments and in some cases said no to countries and states thattried to build apps using more privacy-invading coronavirus technologies.\nIf you don\u2019t already get this newsletter in your inbox,please sign up here.\nWhat happened this week with the initial public stock offerings of Airbnb and DoorDash makes no sense. Truly.\nThe values of both companiesshot through the roof\u2014 to the point where even Airbnb\u2019s chief executive wasalmost at a loss for wordsin a television interview on Thursday.\nI cannot explain exactly why Airbnb is now among the world\u2019s most valuable companies, despite bleeding cash and seeing its travel bookings decline during the pandemic. DoorDash is likewise not a slam dunk winner,as its stock price might suggest.\nSome of this is simply the mechanics of supply and demand. Airbnb and DoorDash, like many companies going public, chose to sell only a small number of shares. And it appears that many people wanted to buy those shares, so the price kept going up. Simple.\nExcept it is not normal for the methodical process of determining a company\u2019s initial stock price to be undone by people willing to pay double or more what professionals decided companies like Airbnb and DoorDash were worth.\nThere are other factors here, asmy colleague Erin Griffith explained. Steps taken by the Federal Reserve to prop up the U.S. economy this year \u2014 and well before \u2014 made it more appealing for people to pour money into investments that can drastically increase in value. (That means they can also drastically decrease in value.Bitcoin,tech start-upsand shares of newly public companies definitely count as risky.)\nBloomberg News alsomentioned other financial changesthis year that may have contributed to the zeal to buy Airbnb and DoorDash shares, such as the increase inrelatively inexperienced people using stock-trading appslike Robinhood. But honestly, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\nMore young companies are going public soon, and maybe there will be sanity. But it\u2019s hard to ignore the disconnect between a climbing U.S. stock market in 2020 and young tech bosses becoming gazillionaires, while many Americans are struggling to the point wherethey are shoplifting food. It really makes no sense.\nAirbnb vs. local restrictions:The Wall Street Journal wrote aboutcity-by-city fights in the United States to restrict short-term home rentals, which some neighbors believe are contributing to housing shortages or making their communities less safe.\nData is not neutral truth:The technology researcherDeborah Raji wrotefor MIT Technology Review about the ways that bias in health care, education and law enforcement becomes encoded in software used in those areas, further reinforcing the bias. My colleagueCade Metzalso has written about artificial intelligence technology that learns from hateful human language and then likewise shows bias and hate.\nAtlanta!It\u2019s \u201cwhere some of the internet\u2019smost important creators are living and workingtoday,\u201d my colleague Taylor Lorenz writes. And she said that Atlanta\u2019s internet creative community is different from other hubs for online talent: Many of the influencers are Black and they\u2019re trying to reverse a gap in funding for Black internet stars.\nThis is a ribbon eel, and it is beauty in motion.\nWe want to hear from you.

        "title": "A TikTok Doctor Talks Vaccines",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nHealth information needs to reach people where they are \u2014 and people are on social media.\nThat\u2019s one message fromDr. Austin Chiang, a 35-year-old gastroenterologist and the chief medical social media officer at Jefferson Health, a hospital system based in Philadelphia.On TikTok, Dr. Chiang makes engaging and informative short videos aboutcoronavirus infection rates,parasites in sushi,colon cancer symptomsandscreenings, and more. Seriously, he makes learning about acid reflux fun.\nThe start on Monday of the United States\u2019mass vaccination campaignagainst the coronavirus puts health professionals in a position to communicate widely about vaccinesto a sometimes skeptical public. Dr. Chiang told me that when he and other health professionals talk about vaccinations and other health information, it\u2019s essential to be upfront with people about what they don\u2019t know.\nHere are edited excerpts from our conversation.\nShira: Why do you make TikTok videos?\nDr. Chiang:Part of what I\u2019m trying to do is humanize our profession. I try to showcase being fun but also professional, and hopefully people can learn something.\nAs doctors, we don\u2019t get any marketing or communications training, and yet we\u2019re expected to contribute to our community and to public health. We have to meet patients where they are, and communicate information in interesting and digestible ways. One of the things that I\u2019m passionate about outside of my clinical work isencouraging more of my colleagues to use social media.\nWhat are some of your videos that have had a big impact?\nOne that I really liked used a song lyric about walking around a neighborhood totalk about how physical activity is sometimes a luxury.I made another video that said off the bat, \u201cYou\u2019re probably seeing this because you\u2019re constipated,\u201d to acknowledge that constipation is a serious problem that many people experience.\n\u201cHow Taiwan Beat Covid\u201d was a message I wanted to get across because I grew up there for part of my life. I wanted to show people that a country was able to tame the virus, but the same approaches might not work here.\nHow might you approach coronavirus vaccines on TikTok?\nIt\u2019s tricky. When we talk about vaccines as health professionals, people who are vehemently anti-vaccine can take it out of context for their agenda. That makes me hold back sometimes.\nThe approach that I try to take is to leave room for the gray. If you say vaccines don\u2019t cause any harm and are the best things in the world, it can alienate people who are vaccine hesitant. If we instead acknowledge that there are risks just like anything else in medicine and life, it\u2019s a more effective message.\nFor coronavirus vaccines, I would probably do something with a voice over that explains my own reasons for getting vaccinated, and lays out the side effects and the risk-benefit analysis I\u2019ve done in my mind and what we gain from the vaccine.\nI\u2019m sure the coronavirus vaccines are confusing to everyone because they\u2019re confusing to us, too.\nHow do you have time to make videos?\nI\u2019m careful to make sure this doesn\u2019t interfere with patient care. I make videos in my own time. At Jefferson, they see the value of using social media to reach people, with caution of course. The Covid testing nurses at Jefferson \u2014the Swab Squad\u2014 also havedance routinesthat they do on their break.\nWhat other health care professionals should we follow?\nOn Instagram, TheNew England Journal of Medicinedoes a great job.Doctor Mike on YouTube,Dr. Cedric \u201cJamie\u201d Rutlandon Instagramand YouTube,Dr. Esther Chooon Twitter andDr. Rose Marie LeslieandDr. Jennifer Lincolnon TikTok are also great.\nTip of the Week\nBrian X. Chen, the consumer technology columnist for The New York Times, discusses Apple\u2019s new feature intended to better inform people what apps are doing with their information:\nThis week, people with iPhones will start to see something new when they are browsing the App Store: Each app\u2019s description will now include a privacy label that is reminiscent of the nutrition labels on food packaging. (Applefirst announced this in June.)\nPeople who want to understand what apps are doing with their information mostly have to hunt on app makers\u2019 websites for their often vague privacy policies. Apple says its labels were designed for people to scan quickly and have clearer information on what data the apps are collecting and for what purpose.\nThe labels present this information in three categories:\nData used to track youacross different apps and websites. For example, your contact information could be used to identify that you\u2019re the same person using another app where you use the same contact information.\nData linked to you: This is information tied to your identity, such as your purchase history or contact information.\nData not linked to you: This is information that is not directly tied to you or your account. For example, a mapping app might say it collects data from motion sensors to provide turn-by-turn directions, but it doesn\u2019t save that information in your account or use that data to track what you do in other apps.\nHow should you use this new information? Before you download an app, take a glimpse at the privacy label. You might be surprised that an app is collecting data that has nothing to do with the service it provides, like a music app that constantly collects your location information.\nIf you don\u2019t like what the company is doing with your data, then you can look for an alternative app with a data collection policy you\u2019re more comfortable with.\nThe pros and cons of a digital health pass:Airlines, employers, schools and entertainment venues may soon require people to verify that they have received a coronavirus vaccination, my colleagueNatasha Singer writes. The advent of electronic vaccination credentials could give people peace of mind, but this might also make it difficult for those with limited access to vaccines or online verification tools to work or travel.\nSchools are using phone cracking tools, too:My colleague Jack Nicas has written before about equipment sold to law enforcement tobreak into people\u2019s smartphoneswith a court warrant to obtain information. Gizmodo found thatsome schools have for years also been buying the phone-cracking equipmentto use on students\u2019 smartphones.\nThis should be interesting:Reddit, the online collection of message boards,bought the company that makes Dubsmash, a TikTok-like video app that is popular among young Black women and is among thesmaller apps where popular online dances often originate.\nThe sweetest tale ever of ayoung girl, her fairy garden and a kind stranger who found comfort being a pen palto her and her family. You might need tissues. (Thanks to my colleague Sheera Frenkel for sharing this.)\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.

        "title": "Our Delivery System Is Breaking",
        "fulltext": "This article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You cansign up hereto receive it weekdays.\nOur online delivery system is stretched to its limits, and that\u2019s stressing out retailers and shoppers this holiday season.\nMy colleagueSapna Maheshwarirecently co-wrote an article about retailers and delivery companiesstruggling with the one-two punchof pandemic-fueled e-commerce and online shopping for the holiday season. This is leading to some online orders being delayed, getting more expensive or both.\nSapna spoke with me about this\u201cshipageddon,\u201dand how the power of UPS and FedEx and our demand for free shipping are contributing to the strain.\nShira: What did you learn from speaking with stores and shipping companies about holiday online orders?\nSapna:I was struck by retailers\u2019 panic and frustration.\nOne clothing and apparel retailer said it felt squeezed on two sides. UPS is charging an extra fee on its holiday deliveries \u2014 several dollars per package, which is often significant on clothes or shoes. The retailer is even removing some heavily discounted items from its website because with the shipping surcharge it figured it would lose money if someone bought only that item.\nAnd UPS imposed a daily limit on the number of holiday season orders it will pick up. The retailer is worried it won\u2019t be able to sell as much merchandise as people want to buy.\nAre higher delivery costs a burden only for retailers, or do they filter down to higher prices for us?\nPossibly both. This is happening because no matter what shipping costs, shoppers don\u2019t expect to pay for it. That\u2019sthe influence of Amazon. But those expenses show up somewhere. It could mean higher product prices for you and me. It could mean lower profits for stores.\nEvery holiday season you see delivery trucks stuffed with packages. Is it really worse this year?\nDefinitely. A holiday season shipping surge always taxes shipping companies, but this year the surgestarted when the pandemic struckin March and hasn\u2019t stopped, asone of our readersalso pointed out.\nWe as shoppers have seen the stresses in the delivery chain more than before.That\u2019s a good thing.\nWhere are the choke points in the system?\nOne of my takeaways from this reporting is how powerful UPS and FedEx are, and growing more so. Those companies \u2014 more than the Postal Service \u2014 are the dominant delivery partners for most chain retailers. That makes it important to understand how they handle order demand, capacity, their work forces and their relationships with customers.\nAre people really not going to get deliveries in time for Christmas?\nMany retailer websites are warning people to order now or deliveries won\u2019t arrive by Christmas. I\u2019m not even sure that those estimated delivery dates are doable. I ordered some things on Black Friday and I haven\u2019t received most of them yet, and the estimated shipping times keep getting delayed. Many readers have said the same.\nWhat\u2019s your advice for shoppers?\nIf there\u2019s a chance that you can shop in stores orpick up online orders in person, it will give you peace of mind and possibly a discount. Some retailers are offering incentives to pick up items in or outside of stores.\nYou can also consider small businesses in your area. Or call your local store or chain and see if they have what you want and can work out a shopping method you feel comfortable with \u2014 maybe ordering over the phone and arranging a distant pick up at the store.\nI\u2019ll leave it to my colleagueBrian X. Chento tell you what personal tech products are worth your money. But I do like to explain the motives behind products.\nApple said on Tuesday that it would soon start selling a new model of wireless over-the-ear headphones that are siblings to the company\u2019s in-ear AirPods. The new AirPods Maxcost $549 and come with a carrying case that looks like a small purse. (Warning: Don\u2019t count on themshipping in time for Christmas.)\nTwo things are important to understand about this Apple product. First, it costs at least $150 more thanmost comparable headphonesbecause Apple knows people will pay $549. You have to give Apple credit for generating so much loyalty that it\u2019s one of the few electronics companies that can (usually) charge much higher prices than its peers, and it works.\nThe second point is that Apple is now releasing more new products than ever before because it is vulnerable. The company\u2019s fortunes are tethered to its star, the iPhone, and the world is simplybuying fewer smartphonesthan it did in prior years. That is probably a permanent change.\nApple sells plenty of other stuff, of course, but the iPhone is the sun around which much of the company\u2019s other products revolve. People who own an iPhone are far more likely to buy AirPods, anApple fitnessor music subscription, an Apple Watch or a HomePod speaker.\nWith people buying fewer new iPhones, one strategy to plug that hole is to sell more stuff to Apple\u2019s pool of customers. If you buy three Apple products instead of one, the company is generally better off. A good way to achieve that goal is for Apple to offer people more products.\nIt\u2019s fair to expect more new product categories from Apple. Just remember that Apple isn\u2019t doing this only to make people happy. It\u2019s introducing new products because it has to.\nThe cyber defenders got hacked:FireEye, which defends companies and governments from cyberattacks, was itself hacked by what my colleagues said was probably Russian intelligence agencies. David E. Sanger and Nicole Perlroth wrote that theculprits made off with FireEye cybersecurity toolsthat the company had previously used to track down Russian hackers.\nA harrowing example of technology assisting government surveillance:The Chinese technology giantHuawei worked with a facial recognition start-up to test a camera system that couldscan faces in a crowd and estimate each person\u2019s age, sex and ethnicity, The Washington Post reported. The companies\u2019 test in 2018 was also set up to send \u201cUighur alarms\u201d to flag members of the mostly Muslim minority group to Chinese government authorities.\nIf you love to read scathing reviews \u2026Brian X. Chen investigated the apparently inaccurate body fat calculations he got from his Amazon Halo health and wellness bracelet, and asked a simple question: \u201cWhat in the world was Amazonthinking releasing a product like this now?\u201d Kara Swisher, a contributing Opinion writer for The New York Times, also found the Haloexcessively creepy.\nPlease enjoy the television chefNigella Lawson pronouncing the word \u201cmicrowave\u201din the fanciest way possible. I love it so much.\nWe want to hear from you. Tell us what you think of this newsletter and what else you\u2019d like us to explore.

Health authorities said they had identified a new, faster-growing variant of the virus.\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, already facing a tough week as Brexit trade negotiations continue, risks additional wrath from members of his Conservative Party over the restrictions. Some questioned the logic of imposing a lockdown now when the government plans to ease restrictions so families can reunite in the days around Christmas.\nHere arethe latest updatesandmaps of the pandemic.\nWe asked readers to send us questions about the new vaccines. Here are theanswers.\nIn other developments:\nThefirst shots were given in the American mass vaccination campaignon Monday morning. President Trumpdelayed plans for White House staff members to get early vaccines.\nThe coronavirus death toll in the U.S. passed 300,000. Over the past week, there has beenan average of 210,112 new cases per day,an increase of 30 percent from the average two weeks earlier.\nThe European Union on Monday unveiled a mobile app aimed at facilitating safe travel within theSchengen zone. The app, called Re-open EU, is intended to help residents of Europe navigate different national restrictions, as well as quarantine and testing requirements.\nThe Netherlands will lock down for at least five weeks to limit the spread of the virus, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced.\nIn New York City,indoor dining has been halteduntil a spike in Covid-19 cases subsides. Thousands of restaurants face an uncertain future as they brace for winter months that could reduce business to new lows.\nIn a crucial milestone for Joe Biden, the Electoral College on Mondayvoted in key battleground stateswith no surprises or defections. Electors in states that President Trump had contested \u2014Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona \u2014 voted for Mr. Biden, while California\u2019s votespushed him past the 270-vote thresholdneeded to win the presidency.\nWith high stakes for both parties,early voting began in the Georgia runoff electionsfor the U.S. Senate.The latest pollsnarrowly favor the two Democratic candidates.\nQuote:\u201cFaith in our institutions held.

What becomes of their skepticism has important implications for democracy.\nWilliam Barr:Mr. Trump announced thatthe attorney general would depart next week, ending a tenure marked by Mr. Barr\u2019s willingness to advance the president\u2019s political agenda.\nCompanies like Amazon, Apple and Google arespending more than ever on lobbyiststo stop European Union regulation against them, hiring former government officials, well-connected law firms and consulting firms and spending millions in the first half of 2020.\nDespite the campaign, the industry has had few major successes. European leaders have denounced the companies as threats to democracy and anticompetitive, and have taken steps to rein them in. Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook either are under antitrust investigation or have already been penalized billions of dollars. In recent years, the European Union has adopted industry-opposed laws on issues including privacy and online copyright.\nRelated:Googleservices including Gmail, Hangouts, Meets and YouTubewent offline on Monday, halting workplaces and classrooms around the globe. The company attributed the problem to an \u201cauthentication system outage\u201d that lasted for about 45 minutes.\nEating fugu has been a perilous act for most of human history. But in Japan, where it\u2019s against the law to serve the fish without a license, the danger is limited \u2014 and, even more so of late, with the rise of farmed fugu believed to be entirely toxin-free.\nDespite cultural concerns about the risk of poisoning, Westerners who chronicle their first taste of fugu tend to dismiss it as bland. Perhaps the experience isso subtle as to be illegible to someone from another culture,suggests our writer.\nAleksei Navalny:Officers from a secret Russian spy unit trailed the Russian opposition leader for years and were nearby at the time he was exposed to a toxic nerve agent thatalmost killed him last summer,according to a new report, in the strongest evidence so far of Moscow\u2019s involvement in the attack.\nBlood donation:Britain announced on Monday that starting next year it wouldallow gay and bisexual menwho have had the same sexual partner for more than three months to donate blood, in a significant easing of restrictions.\nU.S.-Turkey relations:The Trump administration on Mondayissued sanctions against Turkey\u2019s military acquisitions agencyto punish the NATO ally, more than three years after it bought a missile defense system from Russia.\nChinese goods:Chinese exports to the U.S. climbed 46.1 percent in November toa record $51.98 billion, defying the expectations of American politicians who had predicted that the pandemic would be a moment to reduce trade with China.\nSnapshot:Above, retrieving a coffin during a ceremony in Lembang Ma\u2019dong, Indonesia. The Toraja people of southern Sulawesi, one of the country\u2019s largest islands, are known fortheir elaborate death rituals.The bodies of the deceased are kept at home, sometimes for years, until the family has enough money to pay for a funeral.\nLives lived:The Cambodian-American writer Anthony Veasna So, whose his first book was to be published next August, hasdied at 28, on the brink of literary stardom.\nWhat we\u2019re looking at:This week\u2019sNew Yorker coverby the artist David Hockney, accompanied by a Q. and A. with the artist. He reminds us that creativity doesn\u2019t have to be limited to long-revered mediums \u2014 he\u2019s painted hundreds of works this year on his iPad.\nCook:Spreadthis roasted carrot saladacross a platter for a light dinner or lunch \u2014 and don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t find all the herbs.

Let ourAt Home collection of ideason what to read, cook, watch, and do take the stress out of staying indoors.\nAs coronavirus vaccinations get underway in some countries,our OnTech newsletterspoke with the Philadelphia-based doctor Austin Chiang, who tries to supply health information to people by meeting them where they are \u2014 often, on social media.\nWhy do you make TikTok videos?\nPart of what I\u2019m trying to do is humanize our profession. I try to showcase being fun but also professional, and hopefully people can learn something.\nAs doctors, we don\u2019t get any marketing or communications training, and yet we\u2019re expected to contribute to our community and to public health. We\u2019re going to have to meet patients where they are, and communicate information in interesting and digestible ways.\nHow might you approach coronavirus vaccines on TikTok?\nThe approach that I try to take is to leave room for the gray. If you say vaccines don\u2019t cause any harm and are the best things in the world, it can alienate people who are vaccine hesitant. If we instead acknowledge that there are potential risks just like anything else in medicine and life, it\u2019s a more effective message.\nFor coronavirus vaccines, I would probably do something with a voice-over that explains my own reasons for getting vaccinated, and lays out the side effects and the risk-benefit analysis I\u2019ve done in my mind and what we gain from the vaccine. I\u2019m sure the coronavirus vaccines are confusing to everyone, because they\u2019re confusing to us, too.\nThat\u2019s it for this briefing.
