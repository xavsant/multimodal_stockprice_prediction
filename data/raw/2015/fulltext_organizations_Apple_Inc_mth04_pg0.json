        "fulltext": "Apple can\u2019t grow like this forever. No company can.\nIn a few short years, Apple has become the biggest company on the planet by market value \u2014 so big that it dwarfs every other one on the stock market. It dominates the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index as no other company has in 30 years.\nApple\u2019s market capitalization \u2014 the value of all of the shares of its stock \u2014 is more than $758 billion, greater than any other company\u2019s. Yet the Wall Street consensus is that Apple is still having a growth spurt. In fact, if Apple\u2019s watches, phones, laptops and other gadgets and services keep generating favorable publicity \u2014 and if its quarterly earnings report on Monday is as strong as the market expects it to be \u2014 there\u2019s a reasonable chance that Apple\u2019s value will keep swelling. Not far down the road, it might even reach the $1 trillion level that some hedge funds predict.\nBut even if Apple still has some room to run, there are some early warning signs. After all, the company has already crossed a significant threshold. In February, it grew to twice the size of the next biggest company in the S.&P. 500, a rare feat of financial dominance, and one that hasn\u2019t happened since Ronald Reagan was president.\nI checked the numbers with Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. He found that the last market colossus to tower over its competitors by a two-to-one ratio was IBM, which did it in three successive years: 1983, 1984 and 1985. \u201cThat was when PCs were new,\u201d he said, \u201cand just about everyone thought IBM would rule the world.\u201d\nNow it\u2019s Apple\u2019s world. Apple is the most widely held stock in American mutual fund portfolios. IBM, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, isn\u2019t even in the running anymore. It ranks 62nd, according to a Morningstar analysis performed at my request. IBM is still an important company, but it is struggling. Investors judge it to be worth less than one-quarter of Apple\u2019s market value today. What happened to IBM \u2014 how it became this small, in comparison with Apple \u2014 is worth remembering.\nI had forgotten how imposing IBM once was. By some measures, it was vastly more important than Apple is today. Measured by market cap, for example, IBM accounted for a staggering 6.4 percent of the S.&.P. 500 in 1985, IBM\u2019s peak year \u2014 making it 2.35 times the size of the second-biggest company of its day, Exxon. Now Microsoft is the second biggest and Exxon Mobil is third, both roughly one-half the size of Apple. Exxon Mobil is followed in market cap by Google and Johnson & Johnson. (On this 45th anniversary year of Earth Day, the staying power of Exxon, from its Standard Oil days to the present, is also worth remembering.)\nApple has an outsize influence today: After the market close on Friday, its share of the S.&.P. 500 was 4.1 percent, a formidable percentage and a huge increase from Dec. 31, when it was 3.35 percent. But its weight in the market is nothing like IBM\u2019s in the 1980s, when IBM finished seven calendar years with a market weight above 4 percent \u2014 a showing that Apple has not yet met, the data shows. At IBM\u2019s 1985 peak, its share of the S.&P. 500 was more than one and half times the size of Apple\u2019s today.\nApple\u2019s market value is now roughly twice the size of the next biggest company\u2019s in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.\nIBM operated in a different league than Apple does now. A business machine company at its roots, IBM never aspired to pop-culture coolness, but its prestige was extraordinary. You can\u2019t measure prestige easily with numbers, but consider that in 1987,two IBM scientistsbased in Zurich won the Nobel Prize in Physics for a breakthrough in superconductivity. It was the second consecutive year that IBM scientists won the prize; in 1986, two of them won it for inventing an instrument known as the scanning tunneling electron microscope. All of those scientists did deep, basic research of which IBM was justly proud. Apple\u2019s research today is impressive, but it has generally been product-driven, not the kind of fundamental work that IBM did.\nWith hindsight, it\u2019s clear that IBM\u2019s Olympian status was part of its problem. In the 1980s, at the height of its powers, it continued to come up with scientific breakthroughs and ultrafast computers, but its focus on its own product lines and customer service flagged. IBM \u201cna\u00efvely\u201d handed over crucial parts of the computer business to companies like Microsoft and Intel,while its own profit marginsbegan to erode, D. Quinn Mills, a professor at the Harvard Business School, has written.\nFor the most part, investors minimized those problems, if they were even aware of them. In those days of hulking mainframes, IBM was the quintessential computer company and its hegemony in the stock market seemed unstoppable.\nIt\u2019s no wonder that a young Steve Jobs, the co-founder of the upstart Apple Computer company, took direct aim at IBMin a speech in San Franciscoin the fall of 1983, deriding IBM as arrogant and shortsighted and predicting that it would soon be humbled. At that meeting, he unveiled a remarkable ad that would run on television during the 1984 Super Bowl. Created by the director of \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d Ridley Scott, it showed a young hammer-wielding athlete running through a vast grim room populated by serfs. She hurled her hammer at a screen on which an Orwellian Big Brother was intoning propaganda and shattered it.\nA manread the wordson-screen: \u201cOn January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like \u20181984.\u2019\u00a0\u201d Apple didn\u2019t mention IBM, but its target was clear. And soon after the Super Bowl, whenJobs actually introduced the first Macintoshto a rapt audience, the little personal computer continued the assault on IBM. In a cute synthesized voice, it spoke these words, which also appeared on its diminutive screen: \u201cUnaccustomed as I am to public speaking, I\u2019d like share with you a maxim I thought of the first time I met an IBM mainframe: NEVER TRUST A COMPUTER YOU CAN\u2019T LIFT.\u201d\nIBM thrived for years afterward, but just as Jobs had predicted, it turned out to be vulnerable to disruptive change, as all big companies are. For decades now, IBM has engaged in a sometimes painful transition, and as it revealed in its quarterly earnings report last week, it is still hurting: Its revenues have declined and it has endured wrenching business shifts. My colleagueSteve Lohr wrote last weekthat IBM has been getting out of slow-growing old businesses, like personal computers, disk drives, low-end server computers and chip manufacturing \u2014 but its new initiatives in fields like data analytics, cloud computing and mobile apps for corporate customers haven\u2019t entirely succeeded yet.\nIn a turnabout, IBM\u2019s mobile app strategy relieson a partnershipwith the current giant, its old nemesis Apple. IBM is leveraging its prowess with supercomputers and artificial intelligence with a new initiative, Watson Health, that includes Apple. That alliance could help both companies grow \u2014 in Apple\u2019s case, by ensuring that its products work more seamlessly in corporate environments where IBM is deeply entrenched.\nRapid growth, after all, isn\u2019t a sure thing, especially when you\u2019re already the biggest company in the world. IBM has proved that. Sooner or later, Apple investors will have to take that lesson to heart."

        "fulltext": "Here are some of the top business stories to pay attention to in the coming week.\nThe Copyright Royalty Board, a panel of three federal judges in Washington, will begin hearings on Monday on royalty rates for webcasting and Internet radio services like Pandora and iHeartRadio for the next five years. The case is being closely watched in the music industry, where streaming has become increasingly popular but artists have complained about low earnings from online outlets.\nThe judges\u2019 decision will be particularly consequential for Pandora, which now pays almost half its revenue to license recordings. The music industry supports an increased rate, while Pandora and others including iHeartMedia \u2014 the broadcaster formerly known as Clear Channel, which operates iHeartRadio \u2014 want a lower rate. The judges\u2019 decision is expected by December.\u2014Ben Sisario\nApple\u2019s explosive sales in China are continuing to be the main driver of its financial growth. When Apple discloses its earnings for its second quarter on Monday, analysts predict the company will report selling roughly 60 million iPhones, thanks in large part to the Chinese New Year holiday in February. Apple\u2019s big-screen iPhones have been especially popular in China, and the company says it is only a matter of time until most of Apple\u2019s sales come from that region.\u2014Brian X. Chen\nInvestors will be focusing on international operations when two carmakers, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, report first-quarter earnings this week. Both companies are expected to post good results in the booming United States market. But Ford, which reports on Tuesday, has been investing heavily in China to increase production and sales there, while trying to return its troubled European operations to profitability.\nFiat Chrysler, which releases earnings on Wednesday, is also struggling in Europe, where the industry has been in steady decline, and is opening factories in Brazil and China to build Jeep sport utility vehicles for sale in global markets.\u2014Bill Vlasic\nEuropean bank earnings season shifts into high gear this week as a half-dozen of Europe\u2019s largest lenders report their first-quarter results. The Spanish lender Santander, the French bank BNP Paribas and the British lenders Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered are all scheduled to announce the results of their operations. Operating conditions have been generally positive for banks in the first quarter, and lenders are getting past conduct issues that have dogged previous results.\u2014Chad Bray\nLufthansa, the German flag carrier, will hold its annual shareholders meeting in Hamburg on Wednesday, barely a month after a co-pilot for the group\u2019s Germanwings subsidiary was found to have deliberately crashed his plane into the French Alps \u2014 killing himself and 149 others, and throwing the company into perhaps the worst crisis of its 60-year history.\nPresiding over the meeting will be Carsten Spohr, Lufthansa\u2019s chief executive, who took the helm a year ago with a mandate to reduce costs sharply in the face of mounting competitive pressure and tense relations with pilots, who have carried out a series of costly strikes.\u2014Nicola Clark\nSeveral of the world\u2019s largest oil companies will report earnings for the first quarter. BP and Total of France announce results on Tuesday. They will be followed by ENI of Italy on Wednesday and Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil on Thursday.\nAnalysts are forecasting a sharp drop in earnings compared with a year earlier because oil prices are about 50 percent below last year\u2019s levels and natural gas prices in the United States are also low. Bernstein Research in London forecasts that BP\u2019s earnings will fall by 62 percent, to $1.2 billion, and Royal Dutch Shell\u2019s net income will be down 49 percent, to $2.3 billion.\nThe one bright spot for the major oil companies has been refining, where strong demand, low oil prices and cost-cutting have improved profitability, even at hard-pressed European refiners. At companies like Total and Shell, a good refining performance is likely to have partly cushioned the impact of the oil price drop.\u2014Stanley Reed\nElon Musk, Tesla\u2019s chief executive, is expected to announce two new battery products at a news event Thursday evening in Los Angeles. One battery will be for home use, and the other will be for utility companies. By storing energy generated by solar panels, the batteries may solve one of the biggest problems of the emerging boom in solar use \u2014 finding a way to use power when the sun is not shining.\u2014Farhad Manjoo\nBNP Paribas, the largest French bank, is scheduled to face formal sentencing on Friday for having processed dollar transactions on behalf of countries including Sudan and Iran, in violation of sanctions imposed by Washington. The bank pleaded guilty last year to criminal charges in the case and agreed to pay $8.9 billion in penalties. The sentencing in a federal court comes after the bank this month won a Labor Department waiver that allows it to continue operating asset management businesses in the United States.\u2014David Jolly\nOn Saturday, more than 40,000 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders will descend on Omaha for the annual meeting of the company, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary. The gathering is known as Woodstock for Capitalists. Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire\u2019s chairman and chief executive, and Charles T. Munger, its vice chairman, take questions for more than six hours, and their answers often make news.\nLikely hot topics include the company\u2019s recent investment in Kraft, its stakes in IBM and Coca-Cola, the debate around companies\u2019 buying back their own shares and, a perennial favorite, succession planning.\u2014Andrew Ross Sorkin"

When installing, I got a warning that Yosemite won\u2019t support Microsoft Office, so I stopped. Is there any way to use Yosemite and still have access to Word and Excel files?\nA.Microsoft Office for Mac 2004 and earlier versions of the suitedo not run on Mac OS X 10.7 and later(including Yosemite). This is because the programs were written for the older PowerPC processors that Apple began tophase out of its computers in 2006in favor of newer chips from Intel.\nBut even with a Yosemite upgrade, you still have several ways to work with Microsoft Office files on your Mac. Microsoft has newer versions of the programs, including the freeOffice Onlineedition and its subscription-basedOffice 365 suite. The company is alsogearing up to release Office 2016 for Macthis year and has apreview versionavailable on its website.\nWhile you may have to fiddle a bit and remember to save files in Office formats, several other programs allow you to open, edit and save Word and Excel files too. Apple has built alevel of compatibility with Microsoft Office filesintoPagesandNumbers, the corresponding word-processing and spreadsheet programs from its own iWork suite for Mac OS X; a browser-based version is free on theiWork for iCloud betasite online. The open-sourceLibreOfficesuite can work with Office files, as canGoogle\u2019s Docs and Sheets applications, which are free online with a Google account.\nBacking Up a Fire Tablet\nQ.How do you back up the personal data on an Amazon Fire?\nA.Amazon includes a tool in the Fire\u2019s software that you can use for a daily automatic backup when the tablet is in sleep mode and connected to a wireless network. Swipe down from the top of the tablet\u2019s screen and select Settings. Next, choose Device Options, select Backup & Restore and tap the On switch next to Device Backup. You can also do a manual backup by tapping Back Up Now.\nThebackup processsaves your personal settings, tablet layout and bookmarks from the Silk browser; personal photos and videos can be saved to yourAmazon Cloud Drive, the company\u2019s online storage locker. All of the digital media bought from Amazon, like videos and music, is automatically stored online and can be downloaded again.\nTIP OF THE WEEKAlthough Android has aQuick Settingsbox you can use to quickly adjust certain preferences on the phone or tablet, not all the system controls are immediately available there. For those more obscure settings that you use regularly (like Data Usage or Accessibility), you can make your own direct shortcut widget for the home screen.\nTo select your specific settings widget, tap the All Apps icon on the Android home screen. On the top of the Apps screen, tap the Widgets tab. Several screens\u2019 worth of potential screen widgets appear; swipe to the left until you get to the Settings widget. Press your finger and hold your finger on the Settings widget until your device\u2019s home screen appears and you can drag the icon where you want it.\nOnce you have moved the widget into position, a menu of possible settings opens. Tap the Settings category you wish to use. For example, if you select \u201cSound & Notification,\u201d the new widget becomes a shortcut that goes right to the screen of volume preferences for the device\u2019s alarms and other audio cues. You can repeat the widget-creation process to make shortcuts for all your most-used settings."

        "fulltext": "Rumors of the Apple Watch\u2019s unavailability have, it turns out, been slightly, if not greatly, exaggerated.\nIn further evidence of the smartwatch\u2019s positioning as a fashion accessory, as opposed to a tech gadget, while the product may not be in Apple stores to purchase on its official release day of Friday, select destination fashion boutiques around the world have their own stock, and will be offering the watch for sale at the end of the week.\nDover Street Market in Tokyo and London (but not in New York), Maxfield in Los Angeles, Colette in Paris, the Corner in Berlin and 10 Corso Como in Milan are all \u201cofficial\u201d stockists of the watch. And, most are advertising it as \u201cin-store 4.24.15\u201d on their home pages.\nThis is not a closely guarded secret: In March, Apple actually listed the fashion boutiques where its product would initially be sold. But, of course, in the frenzy to fulfill orders through Apple\u2019s own retail channels, the company hasn\u2019t been in a rush to remind customers that the Apple Watch could be bought elsewhere.\nIndeed, Apple\u2019s head of retail, Angela Ahrendts, has said repeatedlythat initially the watch would be sold exclusively online, for deliveries that will begin Friday, and that the watch would not be sold inside stores before June. But it turns out she meant Apple\u2019s own stores.\nWhen it comes to the other stores, the choice is revealing: All globally renowned among fashion cognoscenti as retail trendsetters, their seal of approval is widely seen as a sign that a designer has arrived. Or, in this case, an object.\nAsked about their Apple offering, Carla Sozzani, the owner of 10 Corso Como, responded that all communications were supposed to go through Apple. Ms. Sozzani did acknowledge, however, that she has been wearing an Apple Watch with the Milanese chain band, and she is now a fan (previously she favored a Georg Jensen Vivianna watch).\nAfter earlier declining comment, Apple said on Wednesday afternoon that it had informed many customers who had ordered the Watch that their shipments would arrive sooner than previously expected, though not before April 24. Some customers had reported that their Watch orders were estimated to ship between May and June.\n\u201dOur team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received,\u201d said Amy Bessette, an Apple spokeswoman. \u201cWe know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.\u201d\nAdrian Joffe, the chief executive of Dover Street Market, said the company would have approximately 350 Apple Watches in its Ginza store and 570 in London \u2014 though consumers in search of the gold Edition versions (with prices starting at $10,000) may be disappointed, as they are on back order.\nIn any case, Mr. Joffe said, as far as the stock the company does have, \u201cJudging by the calls, I don\u2019t think it will last long.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "THE popular television show \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has become harder to follow, with all the characters that come and go. But it has also become much easier to watch online.\nThis week,HBO, the premium cable channel that broadcasts \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d released an app, HBO Now, for streaming its programs with no cable subscription required.\nRead that again. No cable subscription required \u2014 and no contract or commitment. For cord-cutters, those of us who have abandoned cable television plans, this is a huge coup and a stark contrast from the situation just a few years ago.\nThe problem facing cord-cutters was depicted in 2012, whenThe Oatmeal, theweb comic, ridiculed HBO for making it difficult to watch \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d online. In the strip, a boy who gets his TV from Internet sources like Netflix fails to find a way to download the show legally and ends up watching pirated episodes.\nThe cheeky comic strip was somewhat prescient. In 2012, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d was themost pirated show of the year, with 4.3 million downloads for a single episode, according to the website TorrentFreak.\nWith the HBO Now app, HBO is adding to the new array of options available to people who want to give up their cable subscriptions and choose only the movies and TV shows they actually want to see. (My colleague Emily Steel gave aroundup of many of those optionslast month.)\nBefore this week, the primary method to watch HBO on a streaming device was through the HBO Go app, which required a cable subscription. And even that was a bit complicated \u2014 some cable providers chose not to support the app on certain devices even if their customers did subscribe to the channel.\nHere are some prominent services offering live TV, \u00e0 la carte networks and other on-demand streaming options in the United States.\nBut enough of the old regime \u2014 let\u2019s move on to the new one. The HBO Now app is, for the most part, available onAppledevices for the time being. On Tuesday, ahead of Sunday\u2019s premiere of Season 5 of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d HBO Now was released for Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV.Cablevision\u2019s broadband customers can also get access to the service through an Apple device or computer web browser. The HBO Now service costs $15 a month, though the first month is free.\nSo how do cord-cutters tune in? Apple and HBO began pushing out the HBO Now software on Tuesday, and HBO listed thestepsfor signing up for the service on its website.\nTo summarize: Customers with black Apple TV set-top boxes should have automatically received the new HBO Now app by now. (The devices should be running the latest version of Apple TV\u2019s software.)\nApple customers with an iPhone or iPad will be able to download the HBO Now app from the App Store. They can subscribe to the service through the App Store\u2019s in-app payment system, or through an iTunes account on the Apple TV. Then they tune in on those Apple devices by using the HBO Now app, or by openingHBONow.comon a computer web browser.\nCablevision\u2019s Internet subscribers can order the service on the company\u2019s website,Optimum.net/HBONOW, or by calling 866-262-9329. Cablevision customers can then log into the HBO Now app on Apple devices, or through a web browser by visitinghbonow.com.\nApple has a loose exclusive on HBO Now. For 90 days, Apple will be the only digital device maker offering the app. But the terms of the exclusive partnership do not apply to cable providers like Comcast or Time Warner Cable. Those providers could offer HBO Now today, though neither of those companies has announced plans to support it yet. Right now the only options are Apple or Cablevision.\nAll that said, overseas customers are out of luck: The HBO Now app is available only in the United States. Jeff Cusson, a spokesman for HBO, said the company \u201chas no plans at this time to go overseas with it.\u201d He noted, however, that the network has a broad international business, offering its programming in more than 60 countries and licensing its content in over 150 markets.\nThere is one more way to watch the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d premiere this weekend without a standard cable subscription: Sling TV. That is Dish Network\u2019s $20-a-month Internet TV service, which includes a slimmer bundle of channels.\nLast week, Dishsaidit would offer Sling TV users access to HBO for an extra $15 a month. Sling TV users will get HBO\u2019s live channel, as well as on-demand content, and the overall service does not require a contract commitment."

Instead, Apple let people order the watch online, for deliveries that began Friday, so customers\n                                        will be spending more time tinkering with their new watches this weekend instead of standing in line.\nThere\u2019s plenty of reading to catch up on, if you\u2019re new to the Apple Watch. Here\u2019s what you need to know on Day 1.\nIn early reviews of the Apple Watch, some technology writers said there was a steep learning curve to getting used to the gadget. Farhad Manjoo, the State of the Art columnist for The New York Times, said it took him\n                                        three days \u2014 \u201cthree long, often confusing and frustrating days\u201d\n                                        \u2014 before he got in the groove.\nThe Watch has a user interface that\u2019s very different than other Apple devices. The digital \u201ccrown\u201d is the signature feature for navigating the device. It can be twisted to zoom in or out of a screen\n                                        or to scroll through lists.\nTo help users get acclimated to the Watch, Apple has posted a detailed user guide on its website walking customers through themany features of the product.\nThe Apple Watch requires an iPhone to fully operate, partly because the brains of apps will live on the iPhone. And as\u00a0reported in March, theapp shopping experienceis a bit different for the Apple Watch. For third-party Watch apps, you\u00a0will\u00a0actually be downloading iPhone apps that have built-in \u201cextensions\u201d to support the Apple Watch. In other words,\n                                        you will look for Watch apps to download using the iPhone, not the Watch.\nApple on Friday hit the switch for the Apple Watch app store.\u00a0Apple\u2019s iPhone customers can search for Watch-compatible apps by opening the Apple Watch app and selecting the tabs labeled \u201cFeatured\u201d\n                                        or \u201cSearch.\u201d The store currently contains several thousand apps.\nIf you\u2019re eager to get an Apple Watch, there are afew boutique fashion shopscarrying it inside\n                                        stores. But if you aren\u2019t lining up already, chances are they will be sold out by the time you get there. Apple doesn\u2019t expect to sell watches directly inside Apple retail stores before June; your\n                                        best bet is toorder one online.\nThe smartwatch, unlike past Apple products, is different from other gadgets that you\u2019ve ever owned. Sure, it\u2019s a wristwatch, but it\u2019s also a miniature computer packed with features designed to augment\n                                        the abilities of the iPhone. The watch cases and bands also come in different materials, sizes and colors. So you\u2019ll want to see how the watch\u00a0feels on your wrist and looks with your outfit.\nEven though you can\u2019t buy an Apple Watch at an Apple store just yet,Apple is letting people try on the Watch inside its stores.\n                                        You can schedule an appointment on Apple\u2019s website, or just walk in and ask an employee to help you try on the Watch.\nThere are three different models sold at different prices, and the bands are interchangeable.

        "title": "Google Joins Its U.S. Peers Under Europe\u2019s Scrutiny",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Over the last few decades, Europe\u2019s regulators have challenged the practices of some of the titans of American technology, includingMicrosoft,Inteland nowGoogle.\nAnd despite years of legal wrangling and in some cases, multibillion-dollar fines, the companies have conducted their businesses virtually unchanged.\nMicrosoftpaid $3.4 billionin fines to European regulators over a decade, but its Windows software did not lose its dominant position in personal computers. Intel is still appealing its antitrust case, which began 15 years ago, even as it has become more powerful than ever in PC chips.\nAnd despite five years of scrutiny by European regulators, Google showcases its own services prominently, such as maps and reviews, in its search results.\nIn theformal antitrust chargesfiled on Wednesday, theEuropean Commissioncomplained only about the results of Google\u2019s shopping searches, noting that investigators were examining other types of search. The agency also beganan investigationinto how Google bundles its apps with its Android smartphone software, an inquiry that also isn\u2019t likely to reach a quick resolution.\n\u201cThe remedy issues are great challenges for antitrust,\u201d said Harry First, a law professor at New York University who has written a book about Microsoft\u2019s antitrust troubles. \u201cThese companies are big and smart and they know their businesses better than the regulators do.\u201d\nThe biggest American tech companies face intensifying scrutiny by European regulators, with \u2014 pressure that could potentially curb their sizable profits in the region and affect how they operate around the world.\nThe slow process of regulatory enforcement is often at odds with the speed at which tech companies must move, which means that even the $1.4 billion fine faced by Intel can seem like a tolerable cost of business to a company that has $14 billion in cash and liquid assets.\nAntitrust issues are not the only legal challenges facing American tech companies in Europe. Regulators and lawmakers are reviewing low-tax arrangements granted toApplein Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg, and privacy watchdogs are looking into how Facebook protects people\u2019s online data. Policy makers are also investigating whether American Internet platforms like Amazon have too much control over how Europeans gain access to online services.\nEven if regulators do not require substantial changes in how these companies do business, all of these fights impose a cost. In addition to negative publicity, legal costs and possible penalties, the cases are a distraction, forcing companies to defend an existing business model to regulators when perhaps they should be abandoning it because of a changing market.\nRapidly changing technology \u2014 rather than regulatory pressure \u2014 has been far more important historically in weakening the dominance of big tech companies.\n\u201cAll the successful firms in the PC and early Web businesses missed mobile or were late to it,\u201d said Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at Stanford who worked for the Justice Department on antitrust matters and has also consulted for Microsoft, Intel and Google over the years.\nMicrosoft and Intel, focused on PCs, both missed the rise of tablet computers and smartphones, allowing companies like Apple, Google and Qualcomm to become dominant players in mobile devices.\nFor Google, mobile apps are now nipping at the primacy of its lucrative web searches as cellphone users pull up Amazon or Yelp to search directly for products or restaurant reviews.\nIn ablog postresponding to Europe\u2019s charges, Google noted, \u201cToday seven out of every eight minutes on mobile devices is spent within apps \u2014 in other words, consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best. And they face no friction or costs in switching between them.\u201d\nStill, the watchful eyes of regulators play an important role in keeping companies\u2019 power in check, and Google\u2019s competitors cheered the European Commission\u2019s actions, which have been much tougher than those of American regulators.\n\u201cGoogle engages in preferencing and manipulates search results so that consumers see content that benefits Google, not the best content for consumers,\u201d Stephen Kaufer, chief executive of TripAdvisor, a travel review site, said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement by the commissioner is the first step to making search on Google better for consumers.\u201d\nMicrosoft, which has played a leading role in organizing industry opposition to Google in Europe, was similarly pleased.\n\u201cClearly every company needs to obey the same legal rules of the road,\u201d the software company said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s decision provides to Google a full opportunity to explain its views at a hearing, and the commission will then have the opportunity to decide whether European legal rules have been respected.\u201d\nOf course, as Microsoft well knows, that is just the beginning of a long process. Microsoft tangled with European regulators off and on for 20 years, starting in 1993, before finally paying its last fine and ending its appeals.\nSome American tech companies have chosen an alternative approach.\nFacebook put itself under European regulatory scrutiny in 2010 by establishing a regional headquarters in Dublin. That means the privacy practices of the social network are generally overseen by Irish regulators, who have traditionally been less confrontational than those in other countries.\ntranscript\nBRUSSELS, BELGIUM (APRIL 15, 2015) (EBS - ACCESS ALL)\n\n(SOUNDBITE) (English) EU COMPETITION COMMISSIONER, MARGRETHE VESTAGER, SAYING:\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s favourable treatment of its comparison shopping service, you probably know it as Google Shopping, is an abuse of Google\u2019s dominant position in general search. Google now has ten weeks to respond, and of course I will carefully consider the response before deciding how to proceed.\u201d\n//\n\u201cOn the basis of our initial investigation, the Commission also today have launched a formal in depth investigation of Google\u2019s conduct as regards the mobile operating system Android, apps and services.\u201d\n//\n\u201cWe do not wish to interfere with screen design, with design choices, with how things are presented on the screen as such or how the algorithm works. This is not what we\u2019re thinking about. Rather, what we would like to see, is that consumers are certain to see the best comparison shopping results, and they should not just be shown the Google Shopping results, if they are not the most relevant response to the query. \u201d\n//\nOur investigation so far has shown that when a consumer enters a shopping-related query in Google\u2019s search engine, Google\u2019s comparison shopping product is systematically displayed prominent at the top of the search results. This display is irrespective of whether it is the most relevant response to the query.\u201d\n\u201cWe have an ongoing dialogue with our regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner, who oversees our compliance with the E.U. data protection directive as implemented under Irish law,\u201d said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman in London. \u201cWe routinely review product and policy updates with them.\u201d\nEurope has stricter privacy laws than the United States, and Facebook says that its conversations with Irish regulators have led to improvements for all of its 1.3 billion global users, including better tools to review and delete individual posts and clearer explanations of the company\u2019s privacy practices.\nFacebook argues that under European law, it is insulated from separate oversight by other European countries. Despite that, government watchdogs in at least six nations \u2014 France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands \u2014 have opened investigations into whether the company\u2019s new privacy policies comply with local rules.\n\u201cWe have investigated Google. Now, it\u2019s time to focus on Facebook,\u201d said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator. \u201cThey are the leader in social networks.\u201d\nEurope\u2019s highest court is also hearing a case that focuses on how Facebook moved European data outside the region. And a class-action lawsuit in Austria, which could lead to a fine of around $12 million, contends that Facebook has not respected the online privacy rights of its users.\nAmazon, bowing to concerns raised by Edward J. Snowden\u2019s revelations of United States government surveillance of American tech companies, decided last fallto open a data centerin Germany for its web services division. The company already had a data center in Ireland, but both German and European Union regulations have restrictions on storing some of their citizens\u2019 personal data across a national or regional boundary.\n\u201cGerman customers wanted a location on German soil, either for perception or legal reasons,\u201d Adam Selipsky, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, said at the time. So Amazon complied."

        "title": "Apple\u2019s Earnings Surge, as iPhone Sales Jump and China Business Rises",
        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s growth engine has now shifted unmistakably to China.\nThe company said on Monday that quarterlyiPhonesales in greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, had surpassed those in Apple\u2019s home market, the United States, for the first time.\nWhile Apple did not disclose specific numbers, the performance powered the company\u2019s revenue, with sales in greater China rising 71 percent to $16.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter compared with the same period last year. Revenue from greater China also exceeded that from Europe for the first time.\nThe China results punctuated another strong quarter for Apple. In total, revenue climbed 27 percent to $58 billion, up from $45.6 billion last year, the company said in its earnings report. Profit was $13.6 billion, up from $10.2 billion a year ago.\n\u201cEverything you look at in China was extremely good,\u201d Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, told analysts in the company\u2019s earnings call. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.\u201d\nApple has long laid the groundwork to reap big sales in China, and revenue growth from the region hassteadily gained momentum. The company in late 2013struck an important dealto sell iPhones through China Mobile, the world\u2019s largest phone carrier. Apple is also expanding its operations in the region, with 21 retail stores and plans to increase that number to 40 by mid-2016.\nAdd to all that the fact that the Chinese New Year holiday, typically a big retail season, was in February. The latest iPhones also have much bigger screens than past models, another feature that has beenespecially popular in China.\nJan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research, said Apple\u2019s performance in China highlighted its advantages against other American technology companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important because it shows that Apple continues to be the only major U.S. tech company that is really succeeding in China, in contrast to Google, Microsoft and Amazon,\u201d Mr. Dawson said.\nOver all, Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, beating analysts\u2019 estimates of roughly 60 million phones. That also far exceeded the 43.7 million iPhones that Apple sold in the period a year ago. Analysts had anticipated that iPhone sales would increase sharply, largely because of the company\u2019s growing presence in greater China. Apple also said it was seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhones from Android smartphones.\nSales of Apple\u2019siPaddeclined for the fifth quarter in a row, however. The company sold 12.6 million iPads, compared with 16.4 million tablets a year ago. Over the last year, Apple\u2019s tablet sales have steadily shrunk, partly because people do not upgrade those devices as frequently as they do smartphones. In addition, as smartphone screen sizes increase, some consumers question whether they need both a tablet and a phone.\nIn an interview, Luca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said the company was nonetheless happy with the iPad\u2019s performance because the tablet continued to top customer satisfaction ratings.\nApple also sold 4.6 million Mac computers in the quarter, up from 4.1 million a year ago. Mr. Cook said Mac sales in China rose 31 percent from a year ago.\nApple reported earnings after releasing itsApple Watch, which began shipping to customersin nine countrieson Friday. On the earnings call, Mr. Cook said that consumer demand was exceeding initial supply, but that he expected Apple to be able to offer the watch in additional countries by late June.\nMr. Cook said Apple was especially happy with the progress in software applications available for the Apple Watch. The App Store now has more than 3,500 apps compatible with the watch, much higher than the 500 apps initially available for the iPhone when the App Store opened in 2008.\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be happier about how things are going,\u201d Mr. Cook said about apps for the watch, adding that customer response so far seemed to be \u201c100 percent positive.\u201d\nAnalysts\u2019 expectations for the watch are modest compared to Apple\u2019s other blockbuster products. Toni Sacconaghi, a financial analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein, estimates that Apple will sell 7.5 million watches in the second half of Apple\u2019s fiscal year, a much smaller number than the tens of millions of iPhones that sell each quarter.\nThe watch is Apple\u2019s first brand-new hardware product under Mr. Cook, who took the reins in 2011, and Mr. Sacconaghi said investors would increasingly be looking at whether the wearable device would become Apple\u2019s next big business.\n\u201cThe iPhone is not going to grow this rate forever in China or globally,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, given that Mac is small and iPad is declining?\u201d\nIt is unlikely that Apple will share sales figures for the watch soon. In a previous earnings call, Mr. Cook said the company would report watch sales in a group with other products, rather than breaking it out into a separate category, to obscure its performance against competitors.\nApple on Monday also said it increased its capital return program by 50 percent, to $200 billion in cash by the end of March 2017. Apple is increasing its share repurchases to $140 billion from $90 billion, and is also raising its dividend to shareholders. The company\u2019s cash and securities pile stood at $193.5 billion as of the end of the quarter."
