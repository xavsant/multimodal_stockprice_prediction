        "title": "Tech Giants Amass a Lobbying Army for an Epic Washington Battle",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Faced with the growing possibility of antitrust actions and legislation to curb their power, four of the biggest technology companies are amassing an army of lobbyists as they prepare for what could be an epic fight over their futures.\nInitially slow to develop a presence in Washington, the tech giants \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google \u2014 have rapidly built themselves into some of the largest players in the influence and access industry as they confront threats from the Trump administration and both parties on Capitol Hill.\nThe four companies spent a combined $55 million on lobbying last year, doubling their combined spending of $27.4 million in 2016, and some are spending at a higher rate so far this year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks lobbying and political contributions. That puts them on a par with long-established lobbying powerhouses like the defense, automobile and banking industries.\nAs they have tracked increasing public and political discontent with their size, power, handling of user data and role in elections, the four companies have intensified their efforts to lure lobbyists with strong connections to the White House, the regulatory agencies, and Republicans and Democrats in Congress.\nOf the 238 people registered to lobby for the four companies in the first three months of this year \u2014 both in-house employees and those on contract from lobbying and law firms \u2014 about 75 percent formerly served in the government or on political campaigns, according to an analysis of lobbying and employment records. Many worked in offices or for officials who could have a hand in deciding the course of the new governmental scrutiny.\nThe influence campaigns encompass a broad range of activities, including calls on members of Congress, advertising, funding of think-tank research and efforts to get the attention of President Trump, whose on-again, off-again streak of economic populism is of particular concern to the big companies.\nLast month, the industry lobbying group, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, awarded its Internet Freedom Award to Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and White House senior adviser.\n\u201cThey are no longer upstarts dipping a toe in lobbying,\u201d said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. \u201cThey have both feet in.\u201d\nFacebook and Google are dogged by concerns over their handling of consumer data, harmful content and misinformation. Amazon\u2019s rapid expansion has been met withunease over labor conditionsand the company\u2019s effect on small businesses. Apple\u2019s control over its app store makes it hard for new apps to get discovered, some rivals say.\nEarlier this week, the threat of government action became more real,driving down their stock prices. The House Judiciary Committee announced a broad antitrust investigation into big tech. And the two top federal antitrust agenciesagreed to divide oversightover Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google as they explore whether the companies have abused their market power to harm competition and consumers.\n\u201cUnwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy \u2014 especially when digital platforms control content,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted after the Judiciary Committee announced its investigation. \u201cThe era of self-regulation is over.\u201d\nThe industry\u2019s troubles mean big paydays for the lawyers, political operatives and public relations experts hired to ward off regulations, investigations and lawsuits that could curtail the companies\u2019 huge profits. The companies all had earlier ties to Democrats but have also worked to develop closer relationships with Republicans.\nFacebook is paying two lobbyists who worked for Ms. Pelosi, including her former chief of staff Catlin O\u2019Neill, who now serves as a director of United States public policy for the social media company.\nMs. Pelosi received nearly $43,000 in total donations for her 2018 re-election campaign from employees and political action committees of Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet, Google\u2019s corporate parent \u2014 each of which ranked among her top half-dozen sources of campaign cash. She had been a champion of tech companies, which have a robust presence in her district in California.\nBut her support for the industry appeared more tenuous last month, when she said Facebook\u2019s refusal to take down a doctored video of her that made her appear drunk demonstrated how the social network contributed to misinformation and enabled Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nGoogle is paying two contract lobbyists who worked as lawyers on the Republican staff of the House Judiciary Committee. One of the lawyers, Sean McLaughlin, also served as a deputy assistant attorney general under President George W. Bush.\n\u201cHaving conducted congressional investigations from the inside, Sean is able to counsel clients on how to respond to them from the outside,\u201d readsMr. McLaughlin\u2019s biographyon the website of his firm, Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, which was paid $50,000 by Google to lobby Congress during the first three months of the year, according tolobbying records.\nThe Washington office of Amazon, whose chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has drawn regular criticism from Mr. Trump, is led by a former Federal Trade Commission official, Brian Huseman. And its roster of outside lobbyists includes three Democratic former members of Congress \u2014 Norm Dicks of Washington, Vic Fazio of California and Kendrick B. Meek of Florida \u2014 as well as two former Justice Department lawyers.\nOne of them, Seth Bloom, was a trial lawyer in the department\u2019s antitrust division in the late 1990s before going on to work on antitrust issues for the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s Democratic staff. He went on to lobby for Amazon, including in connection with its purchase in 2017 of the grocery chain Whole Foods, which required areview of competition concernsby the Federal Trade Commission. Amazon paid$30,000 to Mr. Bloom\u2019s firmto lobby Congress on issues \u201crelated to competition in technology industries\u201d during the first three months of the year.\nIn that span, Amazon also paid$70,000 to the lobbying firmof a top Trump fund-raiser, Brian Ballard, to lobby Congress and the administration. Top-tier lobbyists in Washington can make millions of dollars a year.\nOne of the lobbyists on the account for Mr. Ballard\u2019s firm, Daniel F. McFaul, worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential transition team and then briefly as chief of staff for Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida. Mr. Gaetz is a member of a House Judiciary subcommittee that isplanning a set of hearings, testimony from executives of top companies and subpoenas for internal corporate documents.\nEven before Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, was sworn in at the beginning of the year, the tech companies reached out to him. Mr. Hawley had investigated Google as his state\u2019s attorney general, and the industry saw him as a threat.\nFacebook called, as did Twitter and Google. This winter, in Mr. Hawley\u2019s windowless temporary office, the lobbyists for the companies came to meet with Mr. Hawley\u2019s aides, arguing that their companies contributed to Missouri\u2019s economy and were innovative businesses that did more good than harm for consumers, according to a person familiar with the meetings.\n\u201cThere is a burgeoning awareness that there is a big problem with the dominance of big tech,\u201d Mr. Hawley said in a recent interview. \u201cBig tech may be more socially powerful than the trusts of the Roosevelt era, and yet they still operate like a black box.\u201d\nThe internet giants have learned from the hard lessons of Microsoft, which was caught flat-footed with a sparse lobbying presence in the 1990s when federal antitrust officials called for a breakup of the software giant. Google has especially been forced to deal with regulatory issues, bothin Europe, where it has been hit with three multibillion-dollar penalties, and in the United States, where it escaped an Obama administration-era Federal Trade Commission investigationwithout any action being taken.\nThe companies have separately argued that they have not violated antitrust laws. Google and Facebook say that their services are free and do not harm competitors and that consumers can turn to alternative search and social networking apps. Amazon has said it has a large share of online commerce but only a small fraction of the overall retail market. And Apple argues that the majority of apps in its store are free and that the company rejects only apps that violate its policies on hate speech and pornography, for instance, or try to take too much data from users.\n\u201cWe have seen these tech companies escape accountability for years,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, the vice president of legislative affairs for the government watchdog group Public Citizen. The group, which has called for more user data protections and for breaking up Facebook,published a studylast month showing that in the last two decades, 59 percent of top Federal Trade Commission officials who left the agency entered financial relationships with technology interests regulated by it.\nThe head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, waspaid as a contract lobbyist by Google in 2007to win approval for its acquisition of DoubleClick, which had drawn antitrust concerns. He is now facing pressure to recuse himself if the Justice Department pursues an investigation of the company.\nFederal employees are barred from working on specific issues that affect their former private sector employers or interests, and generally face \u201ccooling off\u201d periods of one to two years after leaving government, during which they cannot lobby their former colleagues. But there are all manner of loopholes.\nMs. Gilbert\u2019s group has called for stricter conflict-of-interest provisions. She said that \u201cin this moment of enhanced scrutiny, the tech companies are going to be looking for those who have the Rolodexes that matter to try to stop regulation and legislation of the type that\u2019s required to protect consumers.\u201d\nIt is hard to avoid the increasing prominence of the companies in Washington.\nThey finance some of the most influential think tanks from across the political spectrum, sometimesmaking it difficult for critical voicesto win funding.\nGoogle and Facebook have provided funding tohundredsof influential trade groups andthink tanksacross the ideological spectrum, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Conservative Union, the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress.\nIn the spring of 2018, Facebook moved into a new office with room for as many as 200 lobbyists, policy experts and engineers for its Washington-based security team. With a full cafeteria, soaring ceilings, wall-size abstract art and concrete floors, the office copies its look from Facebook\u2019s Frank Gehry-designed headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.\nApple is preparing to move into a bigger office, and Google recently opened one of the city\u2019s biggest corporate lobbying offices.\nAmazon also opened a new office near Capitol Hill, where it regularly hosts policy events with members of Congress. And Amazon recently announced that it would place asecond corporate headquartersacross the Potomac River from downtown Washington, in Arlington, Va.\nLast December, in the evening after Google\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, testified for the first time at a House hearing, the company hosted a holiday party with hundreds of government officials at the trendy Wharf along the Potomac.\nScores of lawmakers, including Representatives Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, and Darrell Issa, Republican of California, gathered under neon displays of YouTube and Google. Mr. Issa, who had questioned Mr. Pichai earlier in the day and was within weeks of leaving office, was waiting near one of several open bars for a cocktail."

        "fulltext": "Technology stocks tumbled on Monday, as declines in the biggest companies in the sector punctuated an otherwise quiet day on Wall Street.\nGoogle, Amazon, Facebook and Apple were all lower, following reports that the tech giants are facinggreater scrutinyfrom antitrust regulators in the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index fell by 1.6 percent, bringing its decline from an early May record to 10 percent.\nRegulators appear to be splitting up oversight of the four companies. The Justice Department is exploring an investigation of Google\u2019s advertising and search business, and will oversee antitrust complaints over Apple. The F.T.C. will look into anticompetitive practices at Amazon and Facebook.\nThe delegation of responsibility does not mean that official investigations have been opened, or will be.\nStill, investors reacted to the reports by dumping shares of all four companies. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7 percent, while Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, fell by about 6 percent. Amazon was down 4.6 percent, while Apple was 1 percent lower.\n[Big TechAntitrust ScrutinyExtends to Facebook and Apple]\nThe F.T.C. in February said that it was creating an antitrust task force to look at the tech industry. It is also negotiating with Facebook over a fine for violating a 2011 privacy settlement, whichcould be as high as $5 billion.\nBut the addition of the Justice Department to antitrust oversight points to American regulators\u2019 growing unease with the clout wielded by a handful of Silicon Valley businesses.\nThe broader S&P 500 index was down slightly, but\ninvestors remained watchful of developments on the trade front, afterstocks suffered their sharpest monthly decline this yearin May with a 6.6 percent drop. That nervousness lingered in the bond market Monday, with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds falling, suggesting that investors increasingly believe trade tensions could hinder world economic growth.\n[Things WereGoing Greatfor Wall Street.

Two days earlier, the Chinese governmentthreatened to put American companies and individuals on a blacklistif they stopped supplying their Chinese partners.\nBut stocks were bolstered in part by rising expectations that the Federal Reserve could start cutting interest rates in response to the rising trade tensions.

        "fulltext": "Don\u2019t bring a knife to a chaos factory.\nThat\u2019s mytakeaway after listening to tech leaders at the Code conference last week try to explain the impact of the myriad inventions, good and bad, that they have unleashed upon all of us over the last few years.\nThe \u201cchaos factory\u201d is what Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple, called Silicon Valley in acommencement addressat Stanford on Sunday.\n\u201cToo many seem to think that good intentions excuse away harmful outcomes,\u201d Mr. Cook told the assembled graduates of a school from which much of the modern internet has sprung. \u201cIf you\u2019ve built a chaos factory, you can\u2019t dodge responsibility for the chaos. Taking responsibility means having the courage to think things through.\u201d\nThe graduates may have been listening; the leaders of tech maybe not as much.\n[Kara Swisher answered questions about this column onTwitter.]\nConsider a wide-ranging interview I did during the Code conference last week with Andy Jassy, the sharp chief executive of Amazon Web Services, who defended his company\u2019s facial recognitionsoftware. The program is called Rekognition \u2014 perhaps one of the creepiest names you could give surveillance software \u2014 and can match photos and videos with databases. It has been sold tobusinesses and law enforcement agencies, and its capabilities scare many, given questions of how and where it is deployed. Some critics, for example, are concerned that Immigration and Customs Enforcement may be using Rekognition to help deport immigrants, but Mr. Jassy would not comment on whether that agency uses the program or not.\nBut he made the case that possible abuses of the technology weren\u2019t necessarily Amazon\u2019s responsibility, because any tech tool can be turned into a weapon \u2014 even one as benign as email, which was used in the Sony hack a few years ago. \u201cYou could use a knife in a surreptitious way,\u201d he said.\nAmazon has said problems with Rekognition \u2014 includingone embarrassing experimentby the American Civil Liberties Union in which the program matched 28 members of Congress to other people\u2019s mug shots \u2014 have been largely caused by users not employing the correct settings. It has also issued ethical guidelines for the use of Rekognition. Mr. Jassy said the company would double down on the deployment of the new product, a growing business for Amazon, despite increasing worries, including from some of its own employees, about how it could be abused.\n\u201cI strongly believe that just because tech could be misused doesn\u2019t mean we should ban it and condemn it,\u201d said Mr. Jassy, urging the federal government to create a national law to govern its use if it was concerned. \u201cI wish they\u2019d hurry up,\u201d he added. \u201cOtherwise, you\u2019ll have 50 different laws in 50 different states.\u201d\nThat \u201cwe\u2019ll make it until they start making laws\u201d refrain has become common among techies these days, including in ahigh-profile please-regulate-me op-edby Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg. Still, pressing forward with new and potentially fraught innovations, on Tuesday, the social networking giantuncloaked its Libraproject, a new cryptocurrency system aimed at its billions of users. Though the company made sure to stress the many efforts it was making to protect the system\u2019s data and integrity with partners and management by an independent entity, the move begsfor stringent regulation. But the release of this offering right in the midst of punishing scrutiny of how the company has bollixed its main platform is what one might call a gangster move. Not literally, fingers crossed.\nWhich is to say: We make, we break, you fix.\nTech\u2019s ploy to assuage its growing chorus of detractors has been to beg for forgiveness over and over for making a mess,promise to follow laws once someone else figures out a way to manage the madness, and then hire an army of lobbyists to make sure those rules are not too onerous.\nBut as Mr. Cook put it, you can\u2019t \u201cclaim credit without accepting responsibility.\u201d (Mr. Cook is considered a scold by many in Silicon Valley, as are others who point out issues \u2014 I am a bummer, Roger McNamee a crank, Tristan Harris a goody-goody \u2014 you get the idea.)\nTech\u2019s reticenceto take responsibility was top of mind in another interview during the conference, with Jonathan Ryan, the head of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, orRaices.Appearing after Mr. Jassy, Mr. Ryan said he was struck by the attitude of too many tech execs like him, especially given how high the stakes are as the situation at the border becomes ever more dire.\nPointing out that companies like Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, Palantir and others have been supplying the immigration agencies with all kinds of software, devices and services, some of which may have been used to help separate children from their families, Mr. Ryan said he was perplexed as to why tech companies did not have more of an ethical conscience.\n\u201cI think that what the companies right now that are holding the power need to recognize is that the government could not do what it is doing now without them,\u201d he said.The tech companies\u2019 tools aremaking it possible, he suggested, to track immigrants with increasing expertise: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is a scaling up and a quickening of the efficiency of this tyrannical operation.\u201d\nTech companies have ignored calls by Raices and other groups to stop working with the immigration agencies, even as the crackdowns continue \u2014 including mass migrant arrests that President Trump signaled (via Twitter, of course) would be taking place next week. Mr. Ryan\u2019s colleague Erika Andiola noted that the tech companies\u2019 tools are helping a \u201cmachine of deportation.\u201d\n\u201cIf tech wants to walk hand in hand with our government in this experiment in tyranny,\u201d Mr. Ryan told the crowd, \u201cthen go for it.\u201d\nBut, if you want to use Mr. Jassy\u2019s metaphor instead, tech might want to consider this: Trying to catch these kinds of falling knives \u2014 and fall they will eventually \u2014 is likely to be pretty painful.\nThe Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

        "title": "The Week in Tech: What Not to Expect From Big Tech\u2019s Antitrust Showdown",
        "fulltext": "Each week, we reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox?Sign up here.\nHi, I\u2019m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here\u2019s a look at the week\u2019s tech news:\nBig tech is about to face a reckoning. Probably.\nThe federal government is reportedlyconsidering antitrust inquiriesinto Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. The Justice Department will handle Apple and Google; the Federal Trade Commission takes Facebook and Amazon. The House Judiciary\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust also plans to investigate possible anticompetitive behavior and decide whether current antitrust laws need to be updated.\nThis is what vocal critics, as varied as aFacebook co-founderandSenator Elizabeth Warren, have been waiting for: the chance to hold these companies to account and use antitrust law to break them up.\nBut how far will the new wave of investigations go?\n\u25a0 Don\u2019t expect this to be quick.When the government went after Microsoft in the 1990s (the last major United States tech antitrust case) it took 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation to a court-approved settlement. The work now may be more substantial: Harry First, an antitrust law professor at New York University, said that the agencies taking on these four companies were \u201cclearly ambitious.\u201d\n\u25a0 Forget wholesale change.All the companies have multiple fronts on which antitrust battles could be waged: Google could be pursued for dominance in ad tech, search, Android or something else. \u201cYou can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Mr. First said. \u201cThey will have to find a focus, quickly.\u201d So the agencies will chase specific problems.\n\u25a0 Legal action isn\u2019t guaranteed.The agencies usually take to court only the cases they\u2019re confident they can win, so many investigations fizzle well before that point. And big tech hashuge legal and lobbying teams, so the bar for a government slam dunk is high.\n\u25a0 Punishments may disappoint.Remedies to antitrust violations must be tailored to the harm. If WhatsApp and Instagram were the root of anticompetitive behavior by Facebook, then, sure, force a spinoff. But the remedy is dictated by the (very specific) violation, not vice versa, and it may be that limits on business practices are more relevant.\nAll of which is to say: The antitrust showdown will be long, difficult, uncertain and, for some, potentially disappointing.\nThat doesn\u2019t make it a bad idea. Even abandoned investigations can yield some change: Google made voluntary business changes after the F.T.C. dropped a 2011 antitrust investigation into it. And the point isn\u2019t just fixing the current problem: It\u2019s also about deterring future bad conduct.\nIn 2003, Apple made a masterstroke: Its music software, iTunes, was released for Windows as well as MacOS. ITunes became a Trojan horse, putting Apple products in the hands of non-Apple users and democratizing the iPod, which exploded in popularity.\nFast-forward to this past week, when Applekilled iTunes. Yes, the software was bloated and slow. But it was also a hangover of an older Apple built on the success of the iPod, then the iPhone.\nNow, Apple\u2019s iPhone sales have plateaued, and the company is having to find new ways to grow, said Roberta Cozza, a senior research director at Gartner. Its strategy for that wason display in announcements at its developer conference.\nITunes is being split into Music, Podcast and TV apps, the latest part of Apple\u2019s push to compete on services with the likes of Spotify and Netflix. Its Watch will get a dedicated App Store, so people won\u2019t need an iPhone to use one. And a new universal authentication tool promises more secure logins, not limited to Apple platforms.\nTogether, those announcements show Apple experimenting again with how to put its products in the hands of more people. ITunes is dead; long live iTunes.\nRules can be useful. If we all follow them, they help us coexist in harmony. But sometimes new things happen and rules don\u2019t change. Then things go wrong, people get upset (or worse), and it\u2019s time to invent new rules. That\u2019s also good!\nYouTubeannounced on Wednesdaynew rules that mean \u201cvideos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion\u201d will be banned. So will those denying violent events, like the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut. A three-strike rule will apply to users sporadically uploading such content, and those who repeatedly come close to violation won\u2019t be able to profit from YouTube ads.\nSounds positive. Only, YouTube also showed this past week that it struggles to live by its rules. It came to light that Steven Crowder, a popular conservative commentator on YouTube, had repeatedly insulted Carlos Maza, a journalist from Vox, using racial and sexual slurs. Initially YouTube said Mr. Crowder\u2019s comments did not break its rules. Later, after an outcry, it appeared to backtrack and said he couldn\u2019t earn ad revenue on his channel unless he changed some practices.\nSo, rules. Great if you enforce them effectively. But \u2026 kind of pointless if you can\u2019t?\nImagine you run a company and need money. One idea: Promise a thing to people, take some money and send the thing later. That\u2019s O.K. It\u2019s crowdfunding. What if, instead of offering athing, you offer a cryptographic token to exchange for a thing in the future? That may be less O.K.\nOn Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commissionsued Kik Interactive, a Canadian social media company, over this. In 2017, Kik sold $100 million worth of digital \u201ccoins\u201d called Kin that would be used to buy and sell digital services. This is an initial coin offering, a practice with a bad rap thanks to someless than scrupulous companies. Kik isn\u2019t accused of fraud; it\u2019s accused of not properly registering the offering with the S.E.C.\nThis rests on what, exactly, Kik was offering. The S.E.C. says Kin counted as a security, like stocks, because it couldn\u2019t be used to buy anything when it was launched. The S.E.C. also claims Kik said Kin investors could \u201cmake a ton of money\u201d from appreciation, as with securities. Kik says that Kin is now a proper medium of exchange and that investors didn\u2019t expect to profit, so it\u2019s not a security and didn\u2019t need to be registered.\nWell, it either is or isn\u2019t, and now a court will decide. The distinction will be important: It will shape the S.E.C.\u2019s ability to regulate the industry, and help the crypto world understand what it can, and can\u2019t, do.\n\u25a0 YouTube is a safe haven for pedophiles.Its recommendation systemcreated a vast video catalog of children for them.\n\u25a0 Silicon Valley was seen as an untainted source of political funding.Now,that\u2019s changing.\n\u25a0 Minority Facebook investors want less Mark Zuckerberg.Almost 70 percent voted to appoint an independent chairman, but Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s voting control blocked it.\n\u25a0 Almost everyone has a cellphone.Of about 5.3 billion people on the planet over 15 years old,about five billion have one.\n\u25a0 China is starting to consider A.I. ethics.A new set of guidelines highlightsa willingness to consider the issuein the country.\n\u25a0 IOS 13 and Android Q will change your smartphone.Here\u2019s how.\n\u25a0 Amazon has a new delivery drone.It hauls five-pound packages, has a range of 15 miles and will, apparently,be delivering parcels within months.\n\u25a0 Uber wants to helicopter you from J.F.K. to Lower Manhattan,an eight-minute journey that\u2019llcost a little over $200.\n\u25a0 The Tiananmen Square protest anniversary brought a censorship flurry,fromTwittertofinancial analyst terminals.\n\u25a0 Artificial intelligence could hurt the planet.Training a single algorithm canemit as much carbon as the life cycles of five cars.\n\u25a0Uber and Lyft were blamed for the crisis in New York\u2019s taxi industry.But a New York Times investigation found that was only part of the problem. In the latest episode of \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d airing Sunday night at 10 on FX and starting Monday on Hulu, our reporters introduce you to the bankers, brokers and city officials behind the reckless loans that helped squeeze the taxi industry.\nI\u2019m away next week, and one of my colleagues will be filling in for me. See you again on June 21."

One is a multibillion-dollar software company in Silicon Valley with tens of thousands of employees all over the world. The other is a small Harlem spot that serves Chinese comfort food and is known for its tasty dumplings.\nBut they both say Google is unfairly hurting their businesses, and they have a new audience in Washington eager to hear about it.\nAfter years of showing little interest, Congress and regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department plan toscrutinizethe power, influence and market dominance of Google, as well as fellow tech giants Amazon, Apple and Facebook.\n\u201cObviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly,\u201d President Trump said about large tech companies in aninterviewon CNBC on Monday.\nScores of other tech companies and critics, as varied as software firms and shoemakers or musicians and newspapers, have stewed for years over how, they say, some of the biggest tech firms have used their power and scale to bully them and upend their businesses.\nThe government is listening.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the moment where regulators hang a shingle and say, \u2018We\u2019re open,\u2019\u201d said Luther Lowe, the policy chief at the reviews site Yelp andthe loudest antitrust antagonist against Google. \u201cThe dozens of companies who have been quietly venting in Silicon Valley can begin to form a single-file line around the D.O.J.\u201d\nGoogle, Apple and the other tech giants have pushed back vigorously against the idea that they act anticompetitively. They say that they compete with a broad array of firms \u2014 not just online companies \u2014 and that their services enable the growth of many small and large businesses. The big tech companies haveassembled large teams of lobbyiststo make their case.\nBut when the F.T.C.asked for commentslast year on whether the modern economy required a new approach to consumer protection and competition, the commission received more than 750 letters, many targeting the tech companies.\nThe Retail Industry Leaders Association, the lobbying group that represents Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers,complainedthat the internet was now at the center of consumers\u2019 decision-making and \u201ccontrolled by a relatively small number of highly influential firms.\u201d\nSixteen advocacy groups and think tanks jointly wrote a manifesto that argued for toughantitrust enforcementagainst the tech giants, accusing them of a wide variety of misbehavior, including mishandling people\u2019s data, crippling small retailers or causing internet addiction.\nAnd the Handpulled Noodle, echoing complaints from other small businesses, told the F.T.C. that Google sold ads on its listing in search results. The ads direct customers to delivery apps that charge steep fees and cut into the restaurant\u2019s already thin profit margins.\n\u201cAs a small business, it\u2019s like David versus Goliath,\u201d said Andrew Ding, the owner of theHandpulled Noodle. The shop\u2019s Google listing is how most customers find his restaurant, yet, he said, he has no control over how his business is represented. There is no way for him to get rid of the ad next to the Google listing.\n\u201cGoogle is it,\u201d Mr. Ding said in an interview. \u201cI would love for small business owners that don\u2019t have the clout or the influence to have more say about how their business is represented.\u201d\nGoogle said it allowed companies to place ads next to the listings of other businesses to give users more options.\nThe Justice Department is examining complaints against Google and Apple, while the F.T.C. will handle antitrust issues related to Facebook and Amazon. Last week, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust also announced plans for an investigation into whether the tech companies stifled competition and hurt consumers. The first hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.\nIn Europe, the authorities have been far tougher on the four tech giants. They have imposed about $9.3 billion (8.2 billion euros) in fines against Google in three separate antitrust cases since 2017. They concluded that Googlehad forced phone makersto preinstall its apps,favored its own servicesover rivals in search results andimposed unfair termson companies that use its search services.\nIn his interview on Monday on CNBC, Mr. Trump said European regulators saw \u201ceasy money\u201d in imposing large fines against American firms. \u201cThey are actually attacking our companies, but we should be doing what they are doing,\u201d he said.\nNews Corporation and Axel Springer, the biggest German publisher, have voiced concerns to European regulators about the influence of Google and Facebook over the news business.\nThe publishers lobbied heavily for a new European Union-wide copyright law, passed in March, requiring that large internet platforms pay a license for content shared on services like Google News.\nOracle and Yelp have also taken their complaints to Europe. Ken Glueck, Oracle\u2019s executive vice president and policy chief, said that Google\u2019s dominance of the market underpinning online ads had enabled it to stifle competition, including from Oracle.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to be bigger. But when you have one party who dominates the space and is acting with exclusionary conduct, that affects the market,\u201d Mr. Glueck said.\nThere is a bit of a revenge back story to Oracle\u2019s complaints about Google: The two companies have beenlocked in a nine-year legal battlewith billions of dollars at stake.\nYelp contends that Google favors its own services over rivals in search results in both Europe and the United States, even when the Google content is lower quality or less relevant. Google has said it tries to give people quick answers to their questions instead of sending them to another site.\nIn 2013, the F.T.C. closed an investigation into Google\u2019s search practices after the company agreed to some narrow changes.\n\u201cFor so many years, U.S. companies were having to seek relief abroad because our own enforcement agencies weren\u2019t critically examining the questionable behavior of large firms like Google,\u201d Yelp\u2019s Mr. Lowe said.\nThe European Commission also opened an investigation of Amazon last September and has received informal complaints from eBay and the European e-commerce site Zalando, according to a person involved in the discussions who was not authorized to disclose them.\nA central argument against the tech giants is that other companies must use their platforms because that\u2019s where their customers are. With that leverage, the argument goes, the tech giants force terms on other companies that are unfair and deepen their dominant positions.\nApple makes developers use its App Store to distribute their apps on iPhones and collects up to 30 percent of revenue made through activity inside the app.Spotify recently arguedto European competition authorities that Apple used its App Store to punish Spotify\u2019s app and favor Apple\u2019s competing service.\nApple has said that it welcomes competition and that it has long helped Spotify reach customers. The only time it has requested changes to Spotify\u2019s app is when it \u201ctried to sidestep the same rules that every other app follows,\u201dApple saidin a statement in March. Spotify had directed customers to pay it directly so Apple wouldn\u2019t get a cut.\nNews publishers rely on Google and Facebook to send readers their way. But publishers say that to appear high on those sites, they are encouraged by both companies to use technologies that make Google and Facebook, instead of the news sites themselves, destinations for news. Google and Facebook also dominate the digital-advertising market, the publishers say, squeezing one of their main revenue streams.\nGoogle and Facebook said they competed for ad dollars with a wide range of online and offline platforms, including television, radio, newspapers and billboards. Both said their technologies helped news publishers increase ad revenue.\nGoogle in recent years dropped an effective requirement for publishers to make their news free via Google search results, and introduced a program to help news sites increase subscriptions.\nA Facebook spokeswoman said the company was working on products and training to help news outlets make more money from their articles on Facebook and had committed $300 million in the next three years to support local news.\nMusicians say they must put their songs on YouTube, which is owned by Google, to reach fans, but YouTube pays below-market royalty rates. \u201cHopefully, these investigations drive real change to make sure fans, songwriters and artists all get a fair shake,\u201d said Rosanne Cash, the singer-songwriter who is co-chairwoman of the Artist Rights Alliance, an advocacy group for musicians and songwriters.\nGoogle has said YouTube helps artists reach new audiences and get paid, at the same royalty rates as Spotify.\nSome companies that sell goods on Amazon have argued that they have to be on its site to reach customers. Yet they fret that Amazon can use data about their sales to develop its own competing products. The trade group for major shoe brands, including Nike, Crocs and Dr. Martens, asked the F.T.C. to look intothe \u201cdual role\u201d of platformslike Amazon.\nAn Amazon executive, Jeff Wilke, said at an event last week that those in-house brands were \u201ca tiny fraction\u201d of Amazon sales. \u201cWe do not allow anyone inside Amazon to have access to individual sellers\u2019 data in order to build a private-label product,\u201d he said.\nA Senate hearing last month offered a preview of the potential drama to come in Washington.\nBrian O\u2019Kelley, founder of an ad-technology company called AppNexus,testifiedthat in 2008 he invented an automated bidding system for advertisers that \u201cturned every ad on the internet into a real-time auction.\u201d AppNexus grew to 600 employees.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s response to the threat from AppNexus was that of a classic monopolist,\u201d he said. Google told AppNexus clients that they would need to also use Google\u2019s ad technology if they wanted to serve ads on YouTube, he testified.\nAppNexus\u2019s business slumped, and it laid off 100 employees in 2016.AT&T bought itlast year."

        "fulltext": "PALO ALTO, Calif. \u2014 It has been almost two decades since Google started to dominate internet search the way Microsoft dominated software for personal computers a generation earlier.\nNow computer scientists at Stanford University are warning about the consequences of a race to control what they believe will be the next key consumer technology market \u2014 virtual assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant.\nThe group at Stanford, led by Monica Lam, a computer systems designer, last month received a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation. The grant is for an internet service they hope will serve as a Switzerland of sorts for systems that use human language to control computers, smartphones and internet devices in homes and offices.\nThe researchers\u2019 biggest concern is that virtual assistants, as they are designed today, could have a far greater impact on consumer information than today\u2019s websites and apps. Putting that information in the hands of one big company or a tiny clique, they say, could erase what is left of online privacy.\n\u201cA monopoly assistant platform has access to data in all our different accounts. They will have more knowledge than Amazon, Facebook and Google combined,\u201d Dr. Lam said in an interview.\nVirtual assistants have access to a broader and more personal range of data than, say, a search engine. A virtual assistant can be like a personal secretary, with access to many of the most intimate details of your life.\nDr. Lam is collaborating with a group of Stanford faculty members and students to build a virtual assistant that would allow individuals and corporations to avoid surrendering personal information as well as retain a degree of independence from giant technology companies.\nThe system from Dr. Lam\u2019s group is calledAlmond. In a recent paper, they argued for an approach in which virtual assistant software is decentralized and connected by programming standards that will make it possible for consumers to choose where their information is stored and how it is shared.\nA first version of the service was released last year, and the Stanford researchers are now trying to build an alliance with larger technology and consumer companies.\nThe market for virtual assistants, which do tasks as varied as selecting music or turning on and off thermostats and lights, is booming. Earlier this year Google said that, including Android-based phones, it was nearing installing its Assistant service on one billion devices. Amazon said it had sold more than 100 million Echo and related devices.\nVirtual assistants have not attracted significant scrutiny from government regulators because the market is still small. But a handful of companies \u2014 Amazon, Google, Apple and Microsoft \u2014 are already dominating it.\n\u201cThis is the same situation as with operating systems and browsers,\u201d said Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who has written extensively on the concentration of economic power in the internet era. \u201cIt\u2019s competitively dangerous.\u201d\nThe Stanford researchers are hoping to gain support by making their software freely available to users of smartphones, computers and consumer appliances.\nThey are encouraging makers of consumer products to connect their devices to the Almond virtual assistant through a Wikipedia-style service they call Thingpedia. It is a shared database in which any manufacturer or internet service could specify how its product or service would interact with the Almond virtual assistant.\nThey also hope Almond can leapfrog existing virtual assistant systems in its ability to understand complex language. Virtual assistants are doing a better job of understanding what humans say, but they have made much less progress in understanding what those words mean. Context and nuance are difficult for a machine to understand.\nWhile simple phrases like \u201cWhat is the temperature?\u201d or \u201cPlay a Beatles song\u201d are now routinely handled by computer assistants, routine human interactions that require understanding of context or rely on something that was previously spoken are much more challenging.\nThe services now do best in specific domains, like all the questions you might get about controlling your Spotify account.\nIt has taken years of work to get to this point. Three decades ago, Apple commissioned a group of employees that included Bud Colligan, Hugh Dubberly, Mike Liebhold and Doris Mitsch to create a video showing how in the future humans might interact with computers using spoken language.\nThe video, known as \u201cKnowledge Navigator,\u201d featured an absent-minded professor who talked with a computing system to perform everyday tasks and academic research.\nThe demonstration inspired a number of developers, including the artificial intelligence researchers Adam Cheyer and Tom Gruber, who began research on virtual assistants while they were still at SRI International, an independent research laboratory in Menlo Park, Calif.\nIn 2010, Apple acquired the start-up and then released its technology for the iPhone the following year.\nSince then, Siri has faced stiff competition. Last year, Amazon said it had 10,000 employees working on its Alexa service, many of them focusing on improving the ability to understand complex commands.\nThe Stanford researchers argue that Alexa\u2019s approach, even with thousands of employees, will never be able to adequately deal with the complexity and variability of human language because it is incredibly labor-intensive and may not extend to more complex conversations.\nAmazon researchers, on the other hand, have said that having access to vast amounts of data will give them a meaningful advantage in developing more sophisticated conversational software.\nThe Stanford researchers have developed a system named Genie that simplifies the task of training a so-called neural network. They are improving the accuracy of their service by creating test data, some of it generated by humans and the rest by sentences created by special test programs.\nWhile machine accuracy in understanding spoken words is now routinely above 90 percent, accuracy in understanding complex natural language is substantially lower. A recent paper by the Stanford researchers, which described a significant advance in language understanding, still reached only 62 percent accuracy on \u201crealistic user inputs,\u201d actual statements produced by human test subjects in written form.\n[Get theBits newsletterfor the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.]\nDr. Gruber, who recently left Apple after heading advanced development there, remains skeptical of any near-term technical breakthrough that will make it possible for virtual assistants to have humanlike understanding.\n\u201cWhen you get a question and you don\u2019t know what domain it\u2019s in, then you have this very complicated problem of massive ambiguity,\u201d he said.\nDr. Lam said the threat to privacy cannot be overstated. For example, she noted that Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas last year installed Amazon Echo devices in rooms.\n\u201cOnce they said that what happens in Las Vegas stays there,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that\u2019s no longer necessarily true. Now it might end up in Seattle.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple\u2019s WWDC Highlights: the Death of iTunes and $6,000 Macs",
        "fulltext": "SAN JOSE, Calif. \u2014 In the history of Apple software, few services have been as important and influential as iTunes. It upended the music industry and popularized a new way to buy music, allowing people to purchase songs for a dollar.\nOn Monday, at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple said itwas killing iTuneson Mac computers \u2014 a long-anticipated development that has already occurred on iPhones. The end of iTunes was the most prominent announcement in an opening keynote address that also highlighted a separate app store for the Apple Watch, a $6,000 Mac and the company\u2019s continued emphasis on privacy.\nFor years, Apple users have complained that iTunes was outdated, particularly as streaming music over the internet gained popularity. Apple resisted change for years because iTunes was such a fundamental feature of its Mac computers. But with its new version of Mac software, Apple took the leap and split iTunes\u2019 services into three separate apps.\n[Although it got a little bloated over the years,we will miss iTunes, Kevin Roose writes.]\nNow people will have access to music on one app, to podcasts on another, and to TV and movies on a third. The approach supports Apple\u2019s push to make its Apple Music and Apple TV apps sizable businesses. The services already have their own dedicated iPhone apps. Now they will have the same on Macs.\nApple took a major swipe at the data-collection practices of other companies, including rivals Google and Facebook, with several new privacy features for its devices.\nFor years, smartphone apps have been notorious for collecting people\u2019s location and using that data to better target them with ads,or worse. On Monday, Apple said that on the newest version of its operating system, iOS 13, users would be able to share their location with an app once. Each time the app wants access to the user\u2019s location again, it will have to ask again.\nThe new iPhone software will also be more transparent when apps are tracking location in the background, and it will block apps from using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections to figure out a user\u2019s location.\nApple also unveiled a new way for people to sign into third-party apps and services using an Apple ID, a feature called Sign in With Apple.\nGoogle and Facebook have leveraged their ubiquity for years by enabling people to sign into other apps and websites with their Google or Facebook accounts. But doing so sometimes meant the companies \u2014 Google, Facebook and the third parties \u2014 could collect more data about you.\nOn iPhones and other Apple devices, people can now sign in with a more private Apple ID. With the feature, Apple said, third-party apps in some cases will receive only the user\u2019s name and email address. But if users choose, the feature also allows them to conceal their email addresses by generating a random address that forwards the messages.\n[Read more:Apple is believed to be under scrutiny by the Justice Department, as government agencies set their sights on the tech industry.]\nApple introduced a new version of WatchOS, the software system powering its Apple Watch. Kevin Lynch, the Apple executive who oversees the watch software, said more Apple apps were coming to the watch, like audiobooks, voice memos and a calculator. In addition, the watch includes its own App Store, and third-party apps can now run independently. They no longer require a companion app loaded on an iPhone.\nThis move is a big step toward making the Apple Watch independent from the iPhone. What that means is that at some point in the future, consumers may be able to buy an Apple Watch without having to purchase an iPhone. In other words, Android smartphone users may one day be able to use an Apple Watch.\nApple has wanted to make the iPad the laptop killer for years. While the hardware is svelte and lightweight, the software hasn\u2019t been robust enough to make the iPad the primary work computer for many people. On Monday, Apple announced maybe its biggest effort yet to change that: a new operating system specifically for iPads, called iPadOS.\nCraig Federighi, Apple\u2019s software chief, showed off how the new software made iPads work much more like a desktop computer. The software enables users to more easily switch between apps, use two apps at once, manage downloads, browse the web, and search and share files. In a clear sign of the new target audience of corporate workers, Mr. Federighi showed how he could now work in two Microsoft Word documents at once.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enterprising right there,\u201d he said.\nOne of the biggest applause lines was when he announced that users could now plug in external hard drives.\nApple showed an update for its Mac Pro, its professional desktop computer. The last version, introduced in 2013, was widely panned by professional customers. Apple admitted that the product was a failure.\nThe new Mac Pro looks like a bulky tower, abandoning a previous design that resembled a round trash can. It includes a 28-core processor and lots of memory. The new Mac is also expandable: People can add different graphics cards, for example, to enhance its performance.\nThe Mac Pro looks like an intensely powerful computer. The previous generation failed largely because it was not easily customizable and had performance issues. The product left professional and creative users \u2014 people who work in design and video editing \u2014 to conclude that Apple had abandoned professional customers and cared only about mainstream consumers. With the new Mac Pro, Apple is suggesting it still has interest in this niche market.\nThe Mac Pro starts at a modest $6,000 and should be available this fall.\nApple also announced its next computer operating system, MacOS Catalina. The new operating system has some new features, like the ability for an iPad\u2019s screen to be used as a second monitor for the Mac. The Mac will also include Screen Time, Apple\u2019s tool to help people restrict the time they spend on their devices.\nThe last time Apple announced a new Mac Pro, Tim Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, went on prime-time television to tout that it would be the first Apple computer in years to be made by American workers.\nThen Apple discovered that making a computer in the United States wasn\u2019t so easy. The company ran into a number of headaches at its Texas plant that delayed the Mac Pro\u2019s launch, including a shortage of screws, as wedetailed in a piece this year.\nThat experience is particularly relevant now, as the White House digs into a trade war with China. Apple assembles most of its products, including iPhones, in China.\nWhen Apple announced its new Mac Pro on Monday, it did not mention where it was building it.\nApple announced Project Catalyst on Monday. Developers will now be able to easily port their iOS apps to the Mac, which could bring more apps to the Mac\u2019s App Store. (Compared with the iPhone\u2019s App Store, the Mac\u2019s App Store is very lacking.)\nSharing iOS apps with the Mac raises a number of questions about Apple\u2019s app strategy. When using computers, many people rely on websites instead of apps, like Facebook.com, Twitter.com or the websites for news sites that they read.\nSo what\u2019s the purpose of having iOS apps on the Mac? Apple might argue that apps load more quickly and do a better job at protecting people\u2019s privacy than websites. It may have trouble proving the latter, however, in light of recent news reports that third-party iOS apps leak plenty of data to tracking services."

        "title": "The U.S. Has Its Eye on Big Tech. Will Criminal Inquiries Result?",
        "fulltext": "Get the DealBook newsletterto make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.__________\nWith the federal government ramping up scrutiny of the power, influence and market dominance of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, one interesting question will be whether any of the inquiries develops into a criminal investigation.\nUnlike a civil inquiry, which can result in a monetary penalty, a criminal investigation would ratchet up the pressure on Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple and could result in significant fines along with efforts to break them up.\nThe Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have divvied up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants, and Congressional committees are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers. Only the Justice Department can pursue a criminal investigation, but the F.T.C. and Congress can refer a case to prosecutors if they uncover evidence of illegal conduct.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s \u201cAntitrust Division Manual\u201d allows a case to be developed through a grand jury if there is evidence showing anticompetitive behavior by a company. Information gathered through a civil inquiry that they sought to destroy competition to gain a monopoly could become the basis for opening a criminal investigation.\nThe primary law used to police monopolies isSection 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits \u201cevery contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.\u201d The statute does not define what a monopoly is, butthe F.T.C. has notedthat courts view a firm with less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service as one without sufficient market power to constitute a monopoly.\nFor Google and Apple, which are likely to be investigated by the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, the key issue will be determining what market, if any, they have enough control over to be considered a monopoly. In cloud computing, for example, Google is far behind Microsoft and Amazon. But in internet searches, Google could well be considered to have something close to monopoly power, especially when its very name has become a verb for searching for information.\nA second avenue the Justice Department could pursue is underSection 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits an \u201cattempt to monopolize\u201d trade or commerce. This could be a more amenable path to establishing an antitrust violation because it does not require proving that there is an actual monopoly, only that steps were taken to acquire monopoly power. A document issued by the Justice Department called \u201cAn Antitrust Primer for Federal Law Enforcement Personnel\u201d notes that Section 2 violations \u201care generally not prosecuted criminally,\u201d but if there is enough evidence to show attempted monopolization then there is nothing to prevent prosecutors from pursuing a criminal case.\nBut to do so, the Supreme Court explained, in the 1993 caseSpectrum Sports v. McQuillan, that the government must prove three things: \u201c(1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.\u201d The specific intent to monopolize does not mean that one seeks monopoly power by competing vigorously, but that it is an \u201cintent to destroy competition or build monopoly.\u201d That means a company\u2019s efforts to drive others out of business could be proof that it has the intent to become a monopoly.\nThe \u201cdangerous proximity\u201d element of a violation requires that a court look at the relevant market and determine whether a company has acquired the ability to destroy competition. But just being a ruthless competitor does not necessarily mean the firm is violating Section 2. In a 1984 decision inCopperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp., the Supreme Court pointed out that \u201cit is not enough that a single firm appears to \u2018restrain trade\u2019 unreasonably, for even a vigorous competitor may leave that impression.\u201d\nTechnology companies will argue that they are not overreaching. They are instead just the best competitors, and that is not a violation. And they will have plenty of judicial statements to support that argument. In a 1986 decision inBall Memorial Hospital v. Mutual Hospital Insurance, for instance, the federal court of appeals in Chicago pointed out that \u201ccompetition is a ruthless process. A firm that reduces cost and expands sales injures rivals \u2014 sometimes fatally. The firm that slashes costs the most captures the greatest sales and inflicts the greatest injury.\u201d\nThe penalty for a criminal violation of Sections 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act is a fine of up to $100 million for a corporation; individuals involved could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison and fined up to $1 million.\nThis is not Google\u2019s first foray in dealing with antitrust concerns. In 2011, the F.T.C. investigated whether the company\u2019s search algorithms improperly favored its services. Googleagreed to make some minor changesto its search practice at the conclusion of the inquiry in 2013, but there was no monetary penalty.\nThe European Union fined Google $5.1 billionin 2018 for abusing its power in the mobile phone market by favoring its own services in internet searches. But that penalty does not appear to have had any appreciable effect onGoogle\u2019sbusiness, which earned about $30 billion last year.\nStill, the prospect of impending inquiries will be an unwelcome diversion for the technology companies. Antitrust investigations often take years to develop the type of evidence necessary to move forward with either a civil or criminal case, and the technology companieshave amassed \u201can army of lobbyists\u201dto fight claims that they wield too much economic power.\nThe question of whether the government has the stomach to pursue a major fight with companies that have very deep pockets remains to be seen. In the last two years, the Justice Departmenthas obtainedonly about $240 million in criminal antitrust fines, down from $3.6 billion in 2015.\nSo it\u2019s too early to determine whether the tech companies will ever face any consequences for wielding their market power."

        "title": "Apple Watch Hasn\u2019t Crushed the Swiss. Not Yet.",
        "fulltext": "When Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook,announcedthe Apple Watch in September 2014, the Swiss watch industry shuddered.\nThe company\u2019s arrival in the watch market carried an echo of the quartz revolution that devastated mechanical watchmaking in the 1970s, and some experts wondered whether the Apple Watch would cause a similar upheaval.\nFive years on, the Apple Watch and those from competitors like Samsung and Huawei have not had the crushing effect some Swiss brands had feared. But, as the category continues to grow, some experts say the worst may be yet to come.\n\u201cWe believe,\u201d Mr. Cook said during the 2014 introduction, that the Apple Watch \u201cwill redefine what people expect from its category.\u201d\nWhich category was that? Well, Apple clearly sees itself as a watchmaker. And it has described the Apple Watch as\u201cthe No. 1 watch in the world,\u201dcomparing sales \u2014 although never providing actual numbers \u2014 to those of the traditional industry giants Rolex, Omega and Cartier.\nIt might be an accurate assessment. The research firm Strategy Analytics has calculated that22.5 million Apple Watcheswere shipped in 2018, while the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said the industry exported23.7 million watchesin the same period.\nReports now suggest that 2019 will be the first year Apple outsells the entire Swiss watch industry by volume.\nAnd while sales in the traditional Swiss sector also have been growing, there are indications that the smartwatch expansion has come at the expense of its lower-price timepieces.\nThe federation\u2019s 2018 data shows a 5 percent decline in watches with export prices of less than 500 Swiss francs ( $511), so its growth is being achieved by a reliance on high-end timepieces.\nOne thing Apple\u2019s success produced was an entirely new category in Swiss watchmaking: the luxury smartwatch. A few high-profile brands, including Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Montblanc, introduced smartwatches of their own. Others, like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant, produced hybrids: smartwatches that connect to smartphones but have analog displays like traditional watches.\nAfter an initial sales rush, signs are that the market for luxury smartwatches has been stagnating. (The picture isn\u2019t entirely clear, however, as the manufacturers release so little data.)\nThe Digital Luxury Group, a research and marketing company in Geneva that measures what it calls global \u201cinterest\u201d by tallying internet searches, said the public\u2019s curiosity about luxury smartwatches grew from 2015 to 2017, but has plateaued and, in some cases, declined.\nFor example, according to its research, there were 60,500 Google searches for theTAG Heuer Connected Modularin April, compared with more than 350,000 in December 2015, the month after the watch was introduced.\nAnd some of TAG Heuer\u2019s competitors can only dream of those numbers. Since their 2017 introductions, neitherLouis Vuitton\u2019s Tambournor Montblanc\u2019s Summit luxury smartwatches have exceeded 50,000 Google searches a month, the group\u2019s information showed. And in April, there were just 1,300 searches for the Louis Vuitton watch. (The group said it had no evidence of how the data equated to sales.)\nHowever, Benedicte Soteras, Digital Luxury Group\u2019s head of search, noted that interest in traditional mechanical watches had remained high since 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s like the e-book and print,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will always find audiences for both types of product.\u201d\nAn analyst with Counterpoint Research, a Hong Kong-based analytics company, said his review of market data indicated that luxury smartwatch sales had been declining. When TAG Heuer introduced the Connected Modular range, supported by the might of its LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton parent organization, \u201cthere seemed to be an upswell,\u201d said Peter Richardson, a research director at Counterpoint. \u201cThey seemed to be doing reasonable volumes \u2014 over 1,000 per week. But it seems to have faded off.\u201d\nMr. Richardson said he did not have precise information about shipments of the TAG Heuer smartwatch, but he said the \u201cindicative direction was negative from 2017,\u201d based on research by the Swiss investment bank Vontobel (which calculated a decline of 2 percent in TAG Heuer revenues in 2018).\nThis might explain why luxury watch brands appear to have cooled on smartwatches. For example, Gucci\u2019s \u201csmartband\u201d collaboration with the recording artist and entrepreneur Will.i.am that wasannouncedat Baselworld in 2015 has disappeared. And the only luxury smartwatch introduction at the major Swiss watch fairs this year was TAG Heuer\u2019sConnected Modular Golf Edition, a line extension.\nAnalysts agreed that mixing luxury and the rapid obsolescence of a smartwatch was a consumer turnoff. Mr. Richardson of Counterpoint Research compared luxury smartwatches to the smartphones made by Vertu, his former employer. \u201cIt was incongruous that you had this amazing handcrafted piece of art and engineering, but underneath was this very bog-standard smartphone,\u201d he said of the failed phone brand. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the danger in the luxury smartwatch world.\u201d (Louis Vuitton, TAG Heuer and Montblanc all use Google\u2019s Wear OS, an operating system available in much cheaper watches, like Fossil\u2019s $275 Sport smartwatch.)\nNicolas Baretzki, Montblanc\u2019s chief executive, disagreed. \u201cThis segment will become so big there\u2019s no reason why people would only want to wear ugly things on their wrist,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a clear opportunity to build a luxury segment here.\u201d The company introduced its second smartwatch, the Summit 2, last year. And, Mr. Baretzski said, Summit sales \u201cnearly doubled\u201d in 2018. Montblanc\u2019s parent company, Richemont, also does not disclose sales by brand.\nPeter Stas, chief executive of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant and Alpina, Citizen-owned Swiss brands whose hybrid luxury smartwatches sell in the same range as the Apple Watch, went further in his market analysis. Brands that \u201cstay with a 30-year-old quartz caliber, they\u2019re waiting to die,\u201d he said, referring to Swiss companies yet to adopt the new technology. \u201cSmartwatches are going to take more and more share of the total watch market.\u201d\nHe said his companies, which sit in the so-called \u201caffordable luxury\u201d midmarket segment that has been eroded by smartwatches, have been propped up by their smartwatch sales, which account for 15 percent of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant\u2019s revenues and 30 percent of Alpina\u2019s.\nAnd Mr. Stas, who also heads the smartwatch technology company MMT that produces modules for Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Constant and Alpina watches, said he believed that the development of health apps would prompt more and more consumers, particularly older people, to adopt smartwatches. \u201cHealth prediction functionality is still in the baby phase,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will become better and better, and this is where smartwatches will be devastating for the industry. Health is worth more than prestige.\u201d\nAt least one watch retail group said luxury smartwatches have had little impact on its business.\n\u201cBy nature, they\u2019re peripheral to the luxury market,\u201d said Brian Duffy, chief executive of the Watches of Switzerland Group, which operates 125 stores in Britain and 21 in the United States, and which began trading on London\u2019s FTSE 100 in May.\nThe group recently commissioned a customer survey, Mr. Duffy said, that found only 1 percent of the respondents considered a smartwatch to be a replacement for a traditional watch. \u201cLuxury things you want to have forever,\u201d he said, but with a smartwatch, \u201cyou\u2019re buying technology that has an expiration date on it.\u201d\nHowever, he added, that the group had sold 1.2 million pounds (about $1.5 million) worth of TAG Heuer\u2019s smartwatches in Britain and \u201ccould have sold more\u201d of Hublot\u2019s limited edition Big Bang Referee 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia smartwatch.\nSome analysts said smartwatches actually have had a positive impact on sales of traditional watches.\n\u201cSmartwatches and smartwatch retailers not normally in the watch retail business are bringing additional consumers into wearing a time-telling device on their wrist,\u201d said Reginald Brack of the NPD Group, an information service company.\n\u201cAnd when people wear a time-telling device on their wrist, they want something that\u2019s an expression of who they are. That\u2019s very reassuring for the watch business.\u201d"

        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The federal government is stepping up its scrutiny of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, leaving them vulnerable to new rules and federal lawsuits. Regulators are divvying up antitrust oversight of the Silicon Valley giants and lawmakers are investigating whether they have stifled competition and hurt consumers.\nAfter a spate of unusual negotiations, the Justice Department has agreed to handle potentialantitrustinvestigations related to Apple and Google, while the Federal Trade Commission will take on Facebook and Amazon.\nLawmakers in the House said on Monday that they were looking into the tech giants\u2019 possible anti-competitive behavior. That could lead to the first overhaul of antitrust rules in many decades, an effort to keep up with an industry that didn\u2019t exist when antitrust laws were written.\nThe question of whether tech companies violate antitrust laws has long been the subject of academic debates and industry griping. But now the industry is in the sights of President Trump, Democrats running for president, Congress and consumers. Silicon Valley has faced fierce criticism over disinformation, privacy breaches and political bias.\nInvestors pummeled technology stocks on Monday. Shares of Facebook fell more than 7 percent. Google and Amazon shares were alsosharply lower,and Apple\u2019s stock fell about 1 percent.\nIt does not appear that the agencies have opened official investigations. But the scrutiny from Washington could lead to years of headaches for the companies, raising the prospect of lawsuits to break up companies, hefty fines or new laws limiting their reach.\n\u201cThis is about how do we get competition back in this space,\u201d Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said Monday at a news conference. Mr. Cicilline is the chairman of the House Judiciary\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust, which during the next 18 months plans a set of hearings, testimony from executives from top companies, as well as subpoenas for internal corporate documents.\nMr. Cicilline said the investigation would focus on major digital platforms. The House committee on Monday informed four tech companies, Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, of the plans. If the House investigation finds wrongdoing, lawmakers will pressure the Justice Department or the F.T.C. to investigate, he said.\n\u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d he said.\nThe F.T.C. and Justice Department declined to publicly comment Monday. All four companies also declined to comment, though they have rebutted accusations of anticompetitive behavior in the past.\nPercentage change in each company\u2019s share price at five-minute intervals.\n+\n2\n%\n0\nApple\n\u2013\n2\n\u2013\n4\nAmazon\n\u2013\n6\nAlphabet\n\u2013\n8\nFacebook\n\u2013\n10\n10 a.m.\n12 p.m.\n2\n4\n+\n2\n%\n0\nApple\n\u2013\n2\n\u2013\n4\nAmazon\n\u2013\n6\nAlphabet\nFacebook\n\u2013\n8\n\u2013\n10\n10 a.m.\n12 p.m.\n2\n4\n+\n2\n%\n0\nApple\n\u2013\n2\n\u2013\n4\nAmazon\n\u2013\n6\nAlphabet\nFacebook\n\u2013\n8\n\u2013\n10\n10 a.m.\n11\n12 p.m.\n1\n2\n3\n4\nSource: Refinitiv\nBy The New York Times\nA few weeks ago, the Justice Department and the F.T.C. began negotiations over dividing up the responsibilities for overseeing competition in the tech sector, according to several people close to the discussions.\nThe two agencies often split responsibilities for reviewing mergers. But the recent negotiations show that both agencies were keen on looking into the companies, and that they had probably received complaints from rivals and others.\nTwo people close to President Trump said White House officials were supportive of the agencies\u2019 steps toward greater antitrust oversight over tech companies.\nBut the people, who would speak only on the condition of anonymity, insisted there was no direct pressure on the agencies or involvement from Mr. Trump or any top West Wing officials. The officials attributed the moves to Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees at the agencies.\nOne of the officials said antitrust issues had not recently been a focus of the president, and had not come up in Oval Office meetings with his economic advisers.\nMr. Trump\u2019s lack of involvement could be good news for the potential investigations: After he publicly opposed the AT&T-Time Warner merger, AT&T tried to use his comments in the case as a defense, saying the Justice Department was carrying out a political agenda.\n\u201cBig tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\u201d Representative Doug Collins, a Republican of Georgia and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement about the House investigation. \u201cAs tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive.\u201d\nIt could be years before regulators take action or Congress passes new antitrust laws. Some consumer groups have called for regulators to break up the companies, and Chris Hughes, a Facebook co-founder, has saidthe company must be broken upin order to solve its problems. But most lawmakers and global regulators have stopped short of supporting the breakup of any tech company.\nTalk of antitrust is suddenly fashionable, but efforts by the government to break up companies have been rare, time-consuming and not always successful.\nThe government\u2019s case against IBM went on for 13 years before being dropped. The pursuit of AT&T lasted a decade until the company was broken into the seven Baby Bells. The government chased Microsoft for 12 years, from the first F.T.C. investigation until a settlement was approved by an appeals court.\nOne reason for the slow pace: If you\u2019re big enough to be drawing antitrust heat, you\u2019re big enough to have a lot of lobbyists, lawyers and employees in congressional districts all around the country.\nIn recent decades, a reinterpretation of traditional antitrust theory created a major barrier to regulatory action.\nRobert Bork, a former federal judge and conservative legal theorist, argued in his 1978 book, \u201cThe Antitrust Paradox,\u201d that if the government protected weaker competitors, it would make businesses less efficient, raising prices for consumers.\nHis consumer welfare standard \u2014 all that counts is what happens in the consumer\u2019s wallet \u2014 has been widely used by courts, including the Supreme Court.\nThis interpretation of antitrust helps big tech companies. It is difficult to argue that consumers are being robbed \u2014 the argument made by the Senate for passing the original antitrust laws more than a century ago \u2014 when companies like Google and Facebook do not charge users. Amazon prides itself on charging low prices.\n\u201cFederal enforcers have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d said Sarah Miller, the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, a nonprofit that is critical of the giant tech companies.\nThe antitrust law in Europe is more receptive to the recent complaints about large tech companies, and critics of the businesses have pursued actions there.\nEuropean regulatorsfined Google 1.5 billion eurosthis year for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. It was the third antitrust move against the company by European officials in three years.\nEuropean regulators have expressed concerns about Apple\u2019s dominance in music. In March, Spotify, the music streaming service, filed acompetition complaint with European regulatorsabout how Apple controlled its app store. Spotify accused Apple of unfairly charging fees to its competitors and imposing burdensome rules about marketing.\nApple has argued that the fees are reasonable given that it operates the App Store. It argues that the App Store also gives Spotify and other companies access to millions of potential customers.\nMs. Miller said she wasn\u2019t holding her breath that the new government steps would change the American approach.\n\u201cTime will tell if this announcement leads to meaningful action,\u201d she said."
