        "title": "Amazon and Pandora to Gauge Music\u2019s Value in the Internet Age",
        "fulltext": "How much are people willing to spend for streaming music?\nFor years, thanks to rigid pricing structures at streaming services, the answer has been stuck at $10 a month or nothing. But that model may soon be challenged by two giants of online media: Amazon and Pandora Media.\nBoth companies are set to introduce new versions of their streaming services in coming weeks, charging as little as $5 a month, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process was ongoing. The plans will put pressure on incumbent players like Spotify and Apple Music and offer the music industry a major test regarding the value of streaming music \u2014 including the crucial question of whether discounts will be enough to entice people to pay anything when virtually every song is also available free.\nThe pricing model of $10 a month, the standard rate charged by most on-demand streaming services, has been compared to the 99 cents that Apple charged for song downloads when it opened the iTunes music store in 2003 \u2014 a simple and comprehensible amount that established in consumers\u2019 minds the value of music in the internet age.\nBut many in the business have argued that $10 a month is too high for casual listeners. At $120 a year, it costs more than most people have historically paid for music. According to MusicWatch, a market research firm, the average music customer in the United States will pay about $67 this year on recorded music, up from $55 last year but down from $80 in 1999, around the peak of the CD market.\n\u201cEven with the presence of free, you can still get tens of millions to pay for streaming services \u2014 and possibly much more \u2014 in the event that you get the price much lower,\u201d said David Pakman, a venture capitalist and former digital music executive who haslong arguedthat lower prices would lead to greater sales over all.\nThe streaming market is divided between internet radio services like Pandora, which offer songs tailored to listeners\u2019 tastes but do not let them choose exactly what songs to hear, and so-called on-demand services, like Spotify and Apple Music, which let users pick specific songs and create playlists.\nPandora is expected to make the first move by unveiling, perhaps as early as this week, an expanded version of its $5 subscription platform. That service, which is currently limited to removing ads on its internet radio streams, will soon begin offering customers new features like the ability to skip more unwanted songs and store several hours\u2019 worth of playlists online, according to three people with direct knowledge of the company\u2019s plans.\nBy Christmas, according to these people, Pandora wants to introduce a fully developed competitor to Spotify and Apple Music, with a catalog of tens of millions of songs that a listener can gain access to on demand. That version is expected to cost $10 a month, in line with the current market.\nAmazon\u2019s ambitions may pose more of a challenge to the existing services. The companyalready offersa limited catalog of on-demand music to members of its Prime program, which costs $99 a year for free shipping, streaming movies and other perks. But in coming weeks, Amazon is also expected to introduce a music service with a full catalog, charging $10 a month or about half that amount for customers who use the Echo, Amazon\u2019s voice-activated speaker system, according to several people who have been briefed on the plans.\nFor both companies, the new streaming offerings represent variations on the existing models, with a mix of new features that are intended to entice casual listeners into paying a minimal fee without eroding the ranks of customers who are willing to pay more.\nAmazon and Pandora have spent months negotiating new licensing terms with record companies and music publishers to allow their new streaming offerings, and they are close to completing those deals, according to the people briefed on the plans. Representatives of both companies declined to comment.\nTo some degree, these deals reflect a new willingness among the major record companies to experiment with pricing and shore up a wide field of competitors. Just last year, when Apple was negotiating with record labels over Apple Music, its streaming service, the company wanted to charge customers $8 a month. But the labels balked andheld out for $10, giving Apple no price advantage over competitors like Spotify, Rhapsody and Deezer.\nThat episode, technology executives say, was a window into a little-understood reality of the streaming business: that prices are indirectly enforced through the licensing contracts that services sign with record companies.\nYet while the headline prices have been stuck at $10 a month, analysts and music executives say that a range of discounts and promotions has made it difficult to gauge what customers are really willing to pay. Most offer family plans, student discounts and introductory trials.\nOther services have also made brief and inconclusive attempts to offer online music at lower prices. Last year Rdio, a struggling streaming outlet, introduced a $4 subscription plan that let users listen to 25 songs of their choosing each month. But by the end of the year the companyhad gone bankrupt, and its assets were acquired by Pandora.\nAnother service, C\u00fcr Media, announced its intentions this year to introduce limited streaming plans for as little as $2 a month. But by the summer, it appeared that the company had been unable to raise the $15 million that it said it needed for expenses like licensing deals with record companies. Last month, infilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, C\u00fcr Media reported that it had laid off all of its employees, and that its chairman and chief executive had resigned. Attempts in recent days to reach any representatives of the company were unsuccessful.\nMajor corporate players like Amazon and Pandora do not face such basic questions of financial viability. But there are still doubts about whether lower price points will make any difference to consumers. YouTube makes virtually any song available free, and, much to the chagrin of the record companies, it is widely considered the most popular online source for music around the world. Spotify, in addition to its $10 premium service, also has a free version supported by advertising.\nRuss Crupnick, the managing partner of MusicWatch, the market research company, said his research showed that subscribers to premium services like Spotify were pleased with the product and willing to pay. Furthermore, such customers were also likely to pay for other media subscriptions, like to Netflix, Showtime and so on.\nBut for less engaged consumers, he said, particularly those who are satisfied with radio or free streaming on YouTube, it may take much more to get them to buy a subscription.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that you get the casual listener to automatically be a superfan just by lowering the price,\u201d Mr. Crupnick said."

        "title": "Phone Makers Could Cut Off Drivers. So Why Don\u2019t They?",
        "fulltext": "The court filings paint a grisly picture: As Ashley Kubiak sped down a Texas highway in her Dodge Ram truck, she checked her iPhone for messages. Distracted, she crashed into a sport utility vehicle, killing its driver and a passenger and leaving a child paralyzed.\nWith driving fatalities rising at levels not seen in 50 years, the growing incidence of distracted driving is getting part of the blame. Now a lawsuit related to that 2013 Texas crash is raising a question: Does Apple \u2014 or any cellphone maker or wireless company \u2014 have a responsibility to prevent devices from being used by drivers in illegal and dangerous ways?\nThe product liability lawsuit, filed against Apple by families of the victims, contends that Apple knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Ms. Kubiak from texting dangerously. The suit is unlikely to succeed, legal experts said, and a Texas magistrate in August preliminarily recommended the case\u2019s dismissal on grounds that it was unlikely that lawyers could prove that the use of the iPhone caused the fatal accident.\nMs. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. Her lawyer, Jason Cassel, said she now keeps her phone in the back seat.\n\u201cThe mere fact she\u2019s putting her phone in her back seat in her purse shows she realizes how tempting it is to look down when we get a beep, chime, vibration,\u201d Mr. Cassel said. \u201cShe never wants to be near the possibility\u201d of being tempted to answer it.\nThe product liability case has brought to light a piece of evidence that legal and safety experts say puts Apple in a quandary \u2014 one it shares with other wireless companies. In Apple\u2019s case, the evidence shows, the company has a patent for technology designed to prevent texting while driving, but it has not deployed it.\nApple, Verizon, AT&T and other companies caution about the risks of distracted driving \u2014 and they acknowledge that laws and public education aimed at curbing the behavior are not working. It suggests to legal experts that they can foresee that their product can be used for illegal, dangerous and sometimes deadly activity.\nAT&T even suggests that the behavior has addictive qualities, meaning drivers cannot help themselves. But the companies \u2014 though they offer manual ways to shut down texting on the road \u2014 do not deploy technology that takes the decision out of drivers\u2019 hands altogether.\n\u201cThe technology exists \u2014 we just don\u2019t have the stomach to implement it,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the president of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. In 2012, the safety board sent a letter to the wireless industry association urging the companies to prevent drivers from using their phones while driving.\n\u201cTechnology got us into this situation. Technology will get us out,\u201d she said. However, she added, \u201cWe\u2019re so afraid to tell people what they should do that you can kind of get away with murder under these conditions.\u201d\nGenerally, companies have taken the position that text-blocking technology is embryonic and unreliable. They argue that they cannot shut down a driver\u2019s service without the potential of mistakenly shutting off a passenger\u2019s phone or that of someone riding on a train or bus.\nInstead, companies have taken the approach of simultaneously warning and enabling, a mixed message that underscores a complex swirl of economic, technological and social factors. Perhaps the most pointed question is this: Even if the technology worked to perfection, would people accept having their service blocked? After all, the idea of mobile phone service is to let people communicate on the go.\nDavid Teater, formerly of the National Safety Council and now a private consultant on road safety, who lost his own son to a distracted driver, said companies clearly feared the consequences of cutting off service for their paying customers. It\u2019s an industry, he said, in which one of the most frightening words is \u201cchurn\u201d \u2014 meaning the loss of a customer to a competitor.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re at Apple or you\u2019re at Samsung, do you want to be the first to block texting and driving?\u201d he said. \u201cA customer might say, \u2018If Apple does it, then my next phone is a Samsung.\u2019\u201d\nBut to Mr. Teater, that\u2019s just an excuse. \u201cIf Apple had deployed this technology 10 years ago, there would be more people alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThink about it from a parent\u2019s perspective: How would you feel knowing Apple had the ability to prevent your teen from ever texting and driving, and they chose not to?\u201d\nIn the Apple case in Texas, lawyers who brought the suit had unearthed a fascinating document: a patent filing that Apple made in 2008, which the lawyers said was granted in 2014, for technology that would \u201clock out\u201d a driver\u2019s phone by using sensors to determine if the phone was moving and in use by a driver. If so, it would prevent certain functions, like texting.\nIn the patent, Apple says such technology is necessary because: \u201cTexting while driving has become so widespread that it is doubtful that law enforcement will have any significant effect on stopping the practice,\u201d and \u201cTeens understand that texting while driving is dangerous, but this is often not enough motivation to end the practice.\u201d\nIt is unclear whether Apple has developed the lockout technology.\nWhile texting is on the rise, people are increasingly driving and using Snapchat and Instagram, or taking selfies, or playing Pok\u00e9mon Go. The phone is at the center of all the activity.\nApple says it has taken other steps to address distracted driving. Its CarPlay integrates with some cars so drivers can use voice commands to control some functions of the car and the phone, including letting them orally compose text messages and listen to incoming ones. The technology, Apple says, \u201callows you to stay focused on the road.\u201d\n\u201cWe discourage anyone from allowing their iPhone to distract them by typing, reading or interacting with the display while driving,\u201d Apple said in response to questions. The company did not directly address whether it could or should shut down phone functions. Rather, it indicated that the responsibility was with the driver.\n\u201cFor those customers who do not wish to turn off their iPhones or switch into Airplane Mode while driving to avoid distractions, we recommend the easy-to-use Do Not Disturb and Silent Mode features,\u201d the statement said.\nThese approaches put the onus on drivers to make decisions each time they enter a car or receive a message. In addition, voice-activated systems raise other concerns, said David Strayer, an expert on driver attention at the University of Utah, who said he had studied CarPlay and the feature allowed drivers to perform some functions that could take their attention off the road.\n\u201cIt does not eliminate driver distraction \u2014 not even close,\u201d Dr. Strayer said.\nTechnology is already on the market that can block a driver from having to make a decision. One company, Cellcontrol, sells a device that mounts on the dash and that uses high-frequency sound waves to identify a phone\u2019s location. If the phone\u2019s user is in the driver\u2019s seat, the device can lock out prohibited services.\nThe $129 device, which looks like a small turtle shell, \u201cis very accurate,\u201d said Cellcontrol\u2019s chief technology officer, Joe Breaux. The hiccup is that the technology can sometimes turn off the phone of a passenger sitting behind the driver.\nApple, in its patent, said it was developing \u201ca process in which hand-held computing devices can provide a lockout mechanism without requiring any modifications or additions to the vehicle.\u201d It would use motion and scenery sensors to determine if the phone was moving, and its location.\nBy not putting the technology in place, Apple has \u201cfailed in their social responsibility,\u201d said Christopher Kutz, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, who specializes in the moral and legal principles of liability. \u201cThey should\u2019ve done it, and even done it at a market risk.\u201d\nHe likened the situation to that of gunmakers who could stop selling high-capacity magazines but choose not to.\nAt the same time, Mr. Kutz said, there was little precedent for companies to shut off communications services for safety reasons. In other industries, he said, companies have taken such precautions \u2014 for instance, some manufacturers have technology that will shut down a machine if a worker does not keep two hands on it.\nIn the case of distracted driving, Apple is not the only tech giant recognizing the dangerous behavior and not preventing it. Verizon, like Apple, suggests that current laws are insufficient. \u201cWhile text messaging is banned for drivers in 46 states and the District of Columbia, many people continue to do it, despite knowing the dangers,\u201d Verizon says on a site that promotes free apps and other services available for iPhone and Android that can detect if a phone is being used by a driver and prevent texting.\nThe Verizon messaging app has a driving mode that, when in use, detects if someone is connected to a car\u2019s Bluetooth system and delivers an automatic response to the sender that the recipient is driving, said Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman. However, the message still arrives on the recipient\u2019s phone, allowing the opportunity to check it, Ms. Crummey said.\nThat technology suggests it is possible to identify a driver and apply the technology more broadly \u2014 to, say, social media \u2014 but Ms. Crummey said Verizon didn\u2019t have the same kind of control over Facebook, Twitter or other functions. Further, she said, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to turn off all phone functions, like maps or navigation, that drivers rely on.\nAT&T encourages the use of a free app, Drivemode, that can stop incoming texts. \u201cEveryone knows texting and driving is dangerous, yet when a text message comes in, it\u2019s difficult not to respond,\u201d AT&T says in promoting the app.\nOf course, services like these must be activated by the user and can be bypassed. And AT&T may have identified the reason such solutions don\u2019t work: People find themselves so drawn to their devices that elements of addiction are at play.\nIn fact, AT&T commissioned research by an addiction expert who, in an AT&T news release in 2014, said that using a phone sets off releases of a neurochemical called dopamine that makes it hard to resist the ping. \u201cIf that desire for a dopamine fix leads us to check our phones while we\u2019re driving, a simple text can turn deadly,\u201d David Greenfield, who founded the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, said in the AT&T news release.\nBut if the behavior has addictive qualities, can drivers really be expected to police themselves? And should automated blocking be the answer?\n\u201cDistracted driving is never O.K.,\u201d AT&T said, adding that it had promoted \u201cIt Can Wait,\u201d a public service campaign to discourage texting and driving.\nCTIA \u2014 the Wireless Association, in its response to questions, said, \u201cLaws, consumer education and technology are pivotal, and we\u2019ve seen this three-prong approach work to stop people from this dangerous practice.\u201d\nIt hasn\u2019t worked well enough, some say.\nApple, as one of the great cultural influencers, might have the power to change the conversation \u2014 to make it fashionable to choose safety over the rush of an incoming text, Mr. Kutz said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve made themselves a norm maker,\u201d he said. \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d"

        "title": "Will the New Apple iPhone Have a Headphone Jack? Rumormongers Say It Won\u2019t",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 If Apple had its way, this week would play out like Christmas for 5-year-olds. First, unbelievable anticipation. Then, great surprise. At the end, immense satisfaction.\nWhen the latest iPhone is unveiledhere on Wednesdayin a 7,000-seat auditorium, it probably will instead be more like Christmas for a sneaky 10-year-old who long ago peeked at his present. Thanks. That\u2019s it?\nAnyone who cares enough about the iPhone to know that a new model is being released this month already knows what it is supposed to be like: a little thinner, a little faster and equipped with superior cameras on the Plus model.\nBy far the most controversial feature, however, is the one that will be missing: a headphone jack. A standard element of technology that can be traced back to 1878 and the invention of the manual telephone exchange, the jack is apparently going the way of the floppy disk and the folding map. The future will be wireless.\nWe know about this potential absence thanks to a global information chain, one that shadows the supply and manufacturing chain that produces Apple\u2019s products. The shadow chain is intended to ferret out Apple rumors: promoting them, discussing them and then discussing them some more, long before they become facts.\nThis rumor mill is both a gift to Apple and a burden, a sign that it has not lost its magic and a warning that everyone is on watch for the moment it does. No other company is tracked quite so relentlessly.\nUnder its co-founder Steve Jobs, Apple relished its ability to keep news under wraps and went to great lengths \u2014 legally and otherwise \u2014 to make sure it remained that way. \u201cThere is one more thing, and we\u2019ve managed to keep it secret,\u201d Mr. Jobsexulted in 1999as he introduced iMacs in colors like blueberry and tangerine. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, but we did it.\u201d\nIt was an ambition that his successor, Timothy D. Cook, underlined at a conferencefour years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re going to double down on secrecy on products,\u201d he said.\nThings have not quite worked out that way.\n\u201cWhen Steve Jobs was around, there was still that hope they could surprise you,\u201d said Gene Munster, an Apple analyst. \u201cToday, that hope is largely gone.\u201d\nThe long road to unraveling this week\u2019s surprises began last November, less than three months after the iPhone 6s had debuted to gangbuster first-weekend sales. The Japanese website Mac Otakara, considered a generally reliable source of information that has ties to the factories manufacturing the phone, wrote about Apple removing the jack in the next iPhoneunder the heading \u201crumor.\u201d\nFor anyone not ready to go wireless, the story said, wired earphones would plug into the iPhone via Apple\u2019s Lightning connector, which is typically used for charging power. Traditional headphones would presumably work through a converter.\nThis was big. \u201cHeadphones are one of the most basic functions, so this is something that\u2019s going to affect users of all kinds,\u201d said Eric Slivka, editor in chief of MacRumors.com. \u201cI immediately knew it would be an extremely controversial topic all the way until launch.\u201d\nA poston the MacRumors site, drawing from the Mac Otakara story, included a cautionary note that began, \u201cShould this rumor prove to be true ...\u201d The post received 1,100 comments from Apple aficionados who had no doubt it was and who, in general, did not like the idea of no jack. Cellphones were once like bricks, but losing the jack so the iPhone could be even thinner was felt by some to be a bad bargain.\n\u201cAny thinner and I\u2019ll lose it into the time-space continuum forever,\u201d one commenter joked.\nMacRumors exists for these kinds of moments. So does AppleInsider, Cult of Mac, 9to5Mac and similar sites in various languages, all of which picked up the news and chewed it over. During the next six weeks, helped along by further stories on Chinese blogs, the mainstream media picked it up as well.\nNewsweek, sounding rather overwrought, asked,\u201cIs Apple Ready to Kill the Beloved Headphone Jack?\u201d\nA Fast Company article announced that Apple would be dropping the jack \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s True,\u201d read the headline \u2014 and added that the iPhone would probably support wireless charging and be waterproof.\nBy early January, emotions were at a fever pitch.An online petitionfrom SumofUs.org, which more than 300,000 people have signed, denounced Apple for creating more electronic waste \u2014 presumably, headphones that will no longer work with the iPhone and be thrown out.\nSome commentators explained that even if people used adapters with their old headphones, they were gaining things, too. Other commentators noted that people complained that Apple never innovated anymore, and yet here it was innovating, and people were complaining anyway.\nThen came the rumor that the headphone jack was not going away after all. The Chinese website Mydrivers.compublished a photoof what it said were the innards of the new iPhone with the jack right there. \u201cHas the rumor mill been lying to us?\u201dwondered Cult of Mac. \u201cSurely not!\u201d\nTwo weeks ago, with the volume of commentary picking up as the big reveal approached, even Apple\u2019s other co-founder, Steve Wozniak, weighed in. \u201cIf it\u2019s missing the 3.5-millimeter earphone jack, that\u2019s going to tick off a lot of people,\u201dhe told the Australian Financial Review. But he added a conciliatory note: \u201cWe\u2019ll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.\u201d\nPerhaps it is better to be forewarned about what the future holds rather than be forced to confront it abruptly. \u201cWe soften the blow,\u201d said Neil Hughes, managing editor of AppleInsider. \u201cCan you imagine that if no one saw it coming and Apple just dropped this on Wednesday? People would lose their minds.\u201d\nApple, which declined to comment for this article, most likely has a different view. In late 2004, it went after several websites, including AppleInsider, saying that when they posted details about unreleased products, they were publishing stolen property. At first Apple found success in court but the ruling was sharply reversed on appeal. It was orderedto pay $700,000to cover the sites\u2019 legal fees and generally looked like a bully.\nFor several years, Apple sold a T-shirt in its Cupertino, Calif., campus store that read, \u201cI visited the Apple campus. But that\u2019s all I am allowed to say.\u201d Arecent Apple presentationpoked fun at its extensive security measures. But even if the company can now have a laugh or two at its own expense, its philosophy has not changed.\n\u201cDo you remember when you were a kid, and Christmas Eve, it was so exciting, you weren\u2019t sure what was going to be downstairs?\u201d Mr. Cook said when asked about the rumored Apple carat the annual shareholders\u2019 meetinglast February. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be Christmas Eve for a while.\u201d\nApple might be the richest company in the world, and quite possibly the coolest, but feel for it for a moment. It has to keep making the iPhone exciting enough so tens of millions of people immediately buy one. Apple depends on this. Never before has a company so large and influential been tethered to one consumer product.\nAnd that product, which recently celebrated its one-billionth sale, may have already hit saturation. Apple sold40.4 million iPhoneslast quarter, a drop from 47.5 million during the same period in 2015. It was thesecond straight quarter of declines.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve reached peak iPhone,\u201d said Seth Weintraub, of 9to5Mac.\nBut only for the moment. Even as the Apple faithful wait to see all these rumors confirmed, the scuttlebutt and speculation have started about next year\u2019s model. It will be the iPhone\u2019s 10th anniversary, which means the stakes are going up.\n\u201cApple is hopefully turning on the development afterburners,\u201d Mr. Weintraub said. \u201cWe hear it wants the phone to resemble a sleek glass slab. It\u2019s supposed to be a statement, a really big deal.\u201d\nAssuming, of course, the rumors are true."

Until last week, that is, when Apple updated its software, cracked open iMessage and allowed the ephemera of the outside internet to seep in.\nNow, click on an unassuming arrow in the chat window, and you\u2019ll throw open a junk drawer of digital tchotchkes scavenged from web properties new and old. GIFs, stickers and supersized emoji dominate this digital playground, while text \u2014 actual words \u2014 becomes almost an afterthought.\nBut unlike the freewheeling world of the outside web, where we grab and go as we please, Apple is steering users toward a tightly curated selection of non-textual toys. None would look out of place at a 3-year-old\u2019s birthday party. Many come at a price. Welcome to Apple\u2019s sanitized, monetized version of internet culture.\nApple\u2019s extreme messaging makeover gives us a suite of new visual effects \u2014 throw confetti, release balloons and shoot lasers across the text screen \u2014 that recall the crude, rainbow-colored d\u00e9cor of 1990s-eraGeoCities sites. Another set of tricks turns the text box into a kind of slick, improvised web video: The \u201cloud\u201d effect makes the chat bubble stretch and tremble as it\u2019s delivered, while the \u201cgentle\u201d effect shrinks it down to visualize a whimper. The most superfluous piece of flair is the \u201cdigital touch\u201d feature, which conjures a beating heart or a sizzling fireball when you press on the screen just so.\nThese features mimic the aesthetics of the open internet, which is obsessed with nostalgia and is not exactly subtle. But they can\u2019t replicate the feeling of collecting digital miscellany in our travels across the internet, remixing the material and sending it along to friends who might appreciate the find. The programmatic iMessage sucks the spontaneity from the experience. It standardizes the strange.\nSeveral new features, meanwhile, blow up iMessage\u2019s intimate chat experience to help it compete with the social networks. A handy GIF keyboard jumps off the reaction-GIF empire that Tumblr built, calling up video loops of broadly accessible cultural references (Honey Boo Boo dancing, two Minions giggling) to convey a range of emotional states. Another feature lets you finger-paint directly onto your photos, just like you can on Snapchat. But mostly, this thing feels like Facebook. A new class of iMessage apps \u2014 yes, apps within an app \u2014 lets chatters play Words With Friends, send money through Square or make dinner reservations on OpenTable, all right within the chat window. It feels like iMessage is trying to swallow the rest of your phone.\nThe camera is in here, and so too can be Fandango, ESPN, and, if you want, Carrot, a snarky robot that reads you the weather report for $3.99. In many of these cases, the service is so slight that exchanging actual words would work just fine: Want to see \u201cSnowden\u201d at 10:15? Did you catch the Nats game? It\u2019s 77 and sunny \u2014 greeaaaaat. It\u2019s not clear why every shade of human interaction needs to be mediated by its own app.\nHere\u2019s one theory: Each tap into the iMessage world sends you further away from your chat bubbles and deeper into Apple\u2019s labyrinth of special features. Follow the path to its inevitable conclusion, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re no longer talking with your friends. You\u2019re shopping.\nFive clicks into iMessage, you\u2019ll arrive at Apple\u2019s brand-new sticker shop. Offering colorful sets of illustrations to drag and drop into your chats, it\u2019s one of iMessage\u2019s most tantalizing new destinations. If our chat windows function as modern living rooms, stickers offer the opportunity to appoint our walls with art from cutting-edge digital creators.\nToo bad Apple is most excited to highlight stuff created by brands. This past weekend, the app store showcased sticker packs sponsored by Pok\u00e9mon, Star Wars and Disney. Other top offerings came from the Powerpuff Girls, Marvel, Sesame Street, Sephora, the Backstreet Boys and Ellen DeGeneres, who\u2019scharging$1.99 for a set of illustrations including an avocado in a top hat and a cucumber in a snapback cap. The products are ads for other products.\niMessage is the iPhone\u2019s most trafficked feature. Its chats facilitate an endless combination of social interactions and emotional expressions. But Apple\u2019s shop suggests that all conversations would improve from a Party City-style redecoration, with generic celebratory sentiments and Disney-branded flair.\n\u201cStickers\u201d sound inherently childish, but they don\u2019t have to be. The stickerification of chats was pioneered by Line, a Japanese chat giant that swept Asia and is lately making a bid for western audiences. Line loves corporate synergy, too, heralding sticker sets starring Snoopy, Super Mario and Hello Kitty.\nBut even as it attempts world chat domination, Line services online subcultures. Dozens of sticker sets feature gay characters, and more than one \u2014 \u201cFangirl\u2019s Activities\u201d and \u201cI Love KPOP\u201d \u2014 depicts anime girls in various states of obsession. Then there\u2019s the sex stuff. The \u201cUMAOTOKO\u201d sticker shows two men in horse costumes, uh, stretching together. The most risqu\u00e9 sticker I could find in Apple\u2019s version was in a set called \u201cFailmoji.\u201d It\u2019s a hand-drawn butt with the caption \u201cFART!!\u201d\nApple\u2019s chat overhaul ushers elements of internet creativity into the company\u2019s tightly controlled self-presentation. But the most truly creative expression to unfurl inside iMessages so far has been made in opposition to Apple\u2019s imposed boundaries. Madison Malone Kircher, a writer at the New York magazine tech blog Select All,wrote a handy guideto using iMessage to \u201cannoy the hell out of your friends.\u201d When the tech writer Casey Johnston updated her phone and the new iMessage, she posted screenshots of herself and a friend virtually vandalizing their chat window with smarmy pregnancy stickers, over-the-top effects and graphics layered so high the images became unintelligible. As Ms. Johnstonput it: \u201cThe race to find the worst thing iOS can possibly do is on.\u201d\nMay I suggestthiscelebrity sticker pack created in the image of the white rapper G-Eazy?"

        "title": "Ireland to Appeal Tax Ruling in Apple Case",
        "fulltext": "The Irish government agreed on Friday to appeal a record$14.5 billion European rulingagainst Apple\u2019s tax practices in the country, as tensions mount over whether the technology giant paid a sufficient amount on its global operations.\nThe move comes despite increasing division among Irish ministers over whether to appeal the ruling issued by Europe\u2019s competition authorities.\nSeveral lawmakers have questioned such a move, given that the tax penalty is equivalent to what the country pays annually to fund its national health care system. That debate has intensified since Ireland has faced almost a decade of austerity after the financial crisis.\nDespite the tension, the Irish government unanimously backed the appeal against the tax ruling, though the country\u2019s Parliament will be reconvened on Wednesday to debate the decision.\n\u201cI believe that there are some very important principles at stake in this case and that a robust legal challenge before the courts is essential to defend Ireland\u2019s interests,\u201d Michael Noonan, Ireland\u2019s finance minister, said in a statement on Friday.\nA review of the country\u2019s corporate tax system will also be held to evaluate the complicated structures that multinational companies in Ireland often use to reduce their overall tax obligations. The review, whose details will be outlined in the coming days, will not look at the country\u2019s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate, one of the lowest in the West.\n\u201cWe need to ensure that Ireland\u2019s corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive,\u201d Mr. Noonan added, in reference to a push by governments worldwide to crack down on complex practices used by companies to reduce their overall tax payments.\nThe Irish government\u2019s decision comes a day after Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said that the tech giantwould also appealthe European Commission\u2019s ruling, which argued that Ireland had given Apple preferential treatment.\nMr. Cook, in an interview with the Irish broadcaster RTE, said Europe\u2019s tax clawback was political motivated, \u201cmaddening\u201d and would be overturned on appeal.\n\u201cThe finding is wrongheaded,\u201d Mr. Cook told RTE. \u201cIt\u2019s not true: There wasn\u2019t a special deal between Ireland and Apple.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Apple declined to comment.\nThis week\u2019s ruling over how Ireland treated Apple and its tax practices has led to an increasingly bitter debate between Margrethe Vestager, Europe\u2019s top competition official, and those who argue that her agency has overstepped its remit. Many have claimed that the commission does not have the right to review national tax rules, and that it should not retroactively decide on how certain tax practices should work.\nAt a tax conference in Denmark on Friday, Ms. Vestagerdefended the recent ruling, saying that any country that gave a company preferential tax treatment was the same as a politician handing out a \u201cbundle of cash.\u201d\n\u201cAll of us benefit when businesses pay their fair share of tax,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the interest of the individuals and businesses who do pay tax, if others aren\u2019t paying their share.\u201d\nThe appeals by the Irish government and Apple are expected to last years. Mr. Cook has said the tech giant will set aside money \u2014 based on the calculations of Apple\u2019s back taxes \u2014 in an escrow account if the court eventually sides with the commission."

        "title": "How Tesla and Apple Could Be Good for Each Other",
        "fulltext": "Great partnerships are often forged when each party enjoys a surplus of something the other needs, and there\u2019s little conflict in their ambitions. By that logic, two of Silicon Valley\u2019s best-known firms, Apple and Tesla Motors, really need each other right now. An investment in Tesla by Apple in return for some of the carmaker\u2019s innovation dust might be just the ticket.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, is revamping the company\u2019s approach to self-driving cars and its broader role in the future of transportation. He just fired some of the company\u2019s autonomous car team, according to The New York Times.\nAt Tesla, the founder, Elon Musk, needs billions of dollars of capital as he ramps up the company toward its target of making 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018. He could also use an injection of corporate credibility as his proposed deal to buy his solar-panel venture SolarCity, also publicly traded, appears to be running into unanticipated headwinds.\nThe idea of Apple acquiring Tesla in its entirety isn\u2019t new. It surfaced even before Mr. Cook poached some of Mr. Musk\u2019s engineers a year ago. That move prompted Mr. Musk to tell a German newspaper: \u201cIf you don\u2019t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple.\u201d But it might not require a full purchase to address the strategic challenges of the two companies \u2014 which, arguably, are each becoming most prominent in areas where the other could fairly easily help.\nMr. Musk\u2019s hurdles are the most obvious. The entrepreneur who runs the $30-odd billion Tesla is struggling to persuade investors of the merits of his plan for Tesla to acquire SolarCity. The deal, worth $2.6 billion when announced in early August, is supposed to create a \u201cvertically integrated sustainable energy company.\u201d Last week the deal was publicly panned by James S. Chanos, a prominent hedge fund manager. By the math of the all-share deal, its market-implied chances of success have been falling, too. Shares of SolarCity closed on Monday nearly 25 percent below Tesla\u2019s offer price.\nThe acquisition and the potential conflicts it throws up are a distraction for Mr. Musk from Tesla\u2019s carmaking ambitions, not to mention from the task of proving the safety of the company\u2019s Autopilot feature after a fatal crash in May. Even if investors decide to back him in buying SolarCity, any slippage in either company\u2019s plan could hurt its ability to hit up investors for additional funding. Both need regular cash injections \u2014 over $2 billion each last year \u2014 to fund operating and capital investment outflows.\nApple could easily address Tesla\u2019s capital problem by buying, say, a 20 percent stake. While dilutive to existing owners \u2014 including Mr. Musk, who owns about 21 percent \u2014 that would bring in nearly $8 billion at $215 a share, just under a 5 percent premium to Monday\u2019s market closing price.\nThat would take the question of capital off the table at Tesla for years to come. It would more than cover the negative free-cash flow estimated at $4 billion through 2020 by researchers at Auburn University,in a report titled\u201cDriving Off a Cliff: The Case Against Tesla,\u201d plus any extra needed for the accelerated production targets the company has since announced.\nFor Apple, with more than $230 billion of idle cash, the investment would be close to a rounding error. Its shareholders would probably rejoice at converting a sliver of money in the bank for a placeholder in an emerging leader in self-driving cars. Unlike a full purchase, buying a minority stake will not dilute Apple\u2019s profitability, either. The company has projected gross margins of around 38 percent in its next fiscal quarter.\nNow, what could Tesla do for Apple? With a market capitalization north of $600 billion, Mr. Cook\u2019s business is doing fine at the moment. Shares of the company have gained some 5 percent since the iPhone 7 was unveiled earlier this month. Pre-orders for the new handset have been robust despite reviews that largely called it an incremental advance on its predecessor. Features like wireless earbuds are novel, but hardly game-changing.\nMany analysts, investors and observers want Apple to develop more new products. Its last big product introduction, of watches, was a relative dud. Since the devices went on sale in April 2015, Apple\u2019s shares have fallen 8 percent, and investors fret that the company has been running short of new ideas. At the same time, shares of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, have rallied by nearly 50 percent.\nOne area in which Alphabet appears to be further ahead is self-driving vehicles. Apple doesn\u2019t talk publicly about its plans in the car business, but earlier this month it fired dozens of staff members and closed parts of its so-called Titan project, focused on autonomous cars.\nIdeas are something Mr. Musk has in abundance. In addition to running Tesla and creating SolarCity, he\u2019s trying to make a going concern of space travel and freight through Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. In his spare time, he also hatched the Hyperloop, an idea to use air pressure to speed human beings through tubes at extraordinary speeds.\nIn that respect, he resembles Steven P. Jobs. Even when Apple was in its relative infancy in 1986, its co-founder bankrolled the creation of Pixar, the animation studio. For two decades, that side project put him in conflict with some of the media companies whose content would become a key attraction for iPhone users. In 2006, a year before introducing the handset that changed the world, Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney for $7.4 billion in stock; Disney put him on its board.\nWith competition no longer an issue, Mr. Jobs became a consigliere to Disney\u2019s boss, Robert A. Iger, who told Fortune after the Apple founder died: \u201cWe would stand in front of a whiteboard and talk about ideas. And every once in a while he\u2019d come to me thinking the sky\u2019s falling apart and that our business was screwed. And I\u2019d say, \u2018Tell me how.\u2019\u201d\nThat sort of relationship would probably be hard to develop between a chief executive and a subordinate \u2014 one argument against Apple swallowing Tesla whole. But as a collaboration, with shared goals and running businesses that work together rather than competing for talent and customers, a functional Cook-Musk partnership might serve both companies\u2019 shareholders.\nAs part of the deal, Apple could fold its wobbly car operations into a joint venture with Tesla, add a couple of directors to Tesla\u2019s board \u2014 helping to handle deals with the likes of SolarCity \u2014 and bring Mr. Musk onto its own. Of course, the two executives would have to be capable of playing nice. Mr. Musk might have to walk back his crack last year that Apple was the \u201cTesla graveyard.\u201d"

        "title": "More Fun on Your Wrist With New Apps for the Apple Watch",
        "fulltext": "APPLE this month released afaster, smarter Apple Watchand also sped up its first-generation smartwatch with a faster chip. The speed increase will help watch apps run more smoothly, and plenty of great software is available to take the improved watches for a test drive.\nOne Apple Watch app that is immediately interesting for its simplicity isGlimpse. The newfreeapp essentially replaces your regular time display with a photo drawn from online sources.\nEach time you raise your wrist to check the time, Glimpse drops a different photo onto the display. It\u2019s like a constant feed of news and social media updates, in tiny bite-size form. Glimpse can be connected to content sources like CNN, National Geographic and Time magazine.\nThere is also an option to connect your Pinterest and Twitter accounts. Glimpse grabs images from these sources, updating them throughout the day.\nYou can, of course, still see the time and other information like the weather and your exercise status using Apple\u2019s built-in complications feature.\nThingsoffers interactive lists that help manage your daily life, including work tasks with a deadline, shopping lists and personal goals.\nThe main interface of Things is on your iPhone, where you build a suite of to-do lists, adding a headline title and notes, deadlines and so on. You can see the lists on your watch, where you can mark items as read and add items by voice. The voice recognition feature works well, even in noisy environments like a busy aisle in a supermarket, though you do have to get over the embarrassment of talking to your watch. Things is$10.\nBabbel, the language-learning app, is also on Apple Watch, and uses a clever trick to teach new words and phrases. The app detects where you are and shows relevant words and phrases in the form of a language quiz on the watch screen. For example, as I sat in a cafe in Portugal, Babbel set up a quiz asking what the Portuguese word \u201ca\u00e7\u00facar\u201d meant. I correctly tapped \u201csugar.\u201d\nYou\u2019re not going to become fluent using this watch app alone, but its short, context-based language learning quizzes can help words stick in your memory. Babbel isfree.\nBuilt-in GPS is the signature new feature on the Apple Watch Series 2, and one of the first apps to take advantage of the sensor will beViewRanger. This is a popular hiking and biking app that does a good job of routing you across the countryside and tracking your trekking progress. It shows navigational information and statistics, and buzzes when you need to make a turn.\nWith a coming update, ViewRanger will work with the new Apple Watch\u2019s GPS system for even more precise location awareness. As long as you preset your route before entering the wilderness, the app will work without your phone\u2019s needing a cellphone signal; your phone could even be turned off to preserve battery power. ViewRanger isfree.\nGames on the Apple Watch have always been a bit halfhearted, but the newField Dayapp works well on the device\u2019s tiny screen. You manage a farm, planting crops in a field to fill orders placed for products like carrots and grain. You control the cartoon-style game via the watch\u2019s touch screen and rotating crown, which takes a bit of getting used to, but feels natural after a while.\nSometimes you will be sent to your iPhone\u2019s Field Day app to, for example, chat to the baker about what he would like you to grow for him. On the whole, this is a simple game that is fun andfree.\nLast, for a peek into a potential future for online shopping, check outFancy. This is an image-basedfreeshopping app that shows a wide variety of attractive (and sometimes strange) clothes and other products, and you can select things to buy right on your wrist. Some of the prices are astonishing. In general I would see this as more of a shopping experiment than a regular app, but it\u2019s worth a look.\nTinder is widely known for online dating, but its newTinder Stacksapp for Apple iMessage has nothing to do with finding love. Instead,the appuses Tinder\u2019s famous swipe-left or swipe-right interface to let friends vote on collections of photos you share inside a chat message.\nVerne: The Himalayasis a fun educational app that\u2019s new andfree on Android. Using Google\u2019s 3-D mapping data, the app lets you take control of a cartoon yeti and run, skate or fly around the famous mountain range, learning about locations as you go."

        "fulltext": "To the Editor:\nRe \u201cApple, Congress and the Missing Taxes\u201d (editorial, Aug. 31):\nWhile the editorial is spot on in calling for an end to the deferral process, it sorely missed the mark in characterizing President Obama\u2019s proposed repatriation rate as \u201creasonable.\u201d Tax holidays incentivize bad business behavior and reward companies that extract wealth from communities with a deep discount and a clean conscience.\nA 14 percent rate on repatriated funds previously held offshore is a handout to large multinational corporations at the expense of small-business owners and our customers. Far from reasonable, it\u2019s been estimated by the Main Street Alliance that the proposed holiday rate would be a $20 billion gift to Apple.\nWith their nearly unlimited access to capital and ability to buy in bulk, industry giants like Apple already hold a competitive edge over small to mid-sized businesses, which can\u2019t afford to hire high-priced tax accountants and lawyers to devise tax avoidance schemes.\nTo level the playing field for Main Street businesses, Congress must act to end deferral, stop incentivizing offshoring of revenues with tax holidays, and hold all companies accountable to pay what they owe when they owe it.\nDEBORAH FIELD\nPortland, Ore.\nThe writer, a small-business owner and former accountant, is a member of the Main Street Alliance.\nTo the Editor:\nI find it infuriating that Apple, Microsoft, Google and many other highly successful so-called American companies have found legal ways to avoid paying anywhere close to a fair share of taxes on their profits. Their executives and shareholders win and the rest of us lose.\nI find it even more infuriating when pharmaceutical companies play the same tax avoidance game, but also jack up the prices of essential and unique medications by several hundred percent, and expect taxpayers to foot the bill through federal insurance programs.\nHow many ordinary Americans are disadvantaged by these practices \u2014 people who are not earning the big bonuses and dividends generated by these practices, but rather have to pay the increased taxes to cover them? Come on, Congress, do something. At least pretend you represent the people.\nDON CARLSON\nBoston\nTo the Editor:\nApple and other companies are only doing what our laws and those of their host countries abroad allow them to do. The problem, as you point out, lies with our own tax laws and enforcement. A way forward would be to apply basic accounting principles to reformulate our tax policies. These include:\n1. Profits should generally be taxed in the country in which business is conducted and profits are generated.\n2. Profits should be taxed in the year in which they are generated.\n3. Like individual American citizens, American businesses should be taxed at home each year on their combined \u201cworldwide\u201d income.\n4. Corporations should be entitled to an offsetting American credit for taxes paid to foreign countries if we have bilateral tax treaties with those countries. This should allow us to modify our current deferral policy of profits not taxed until repatriated.\nTo further discourage tax inversion and offshore profit harboring, we must review our own tax rates and make them more competitive with other nations, while also persuading countries like Ireland that are members of the World Trade Organization not to adopt a very low-rate, tax haven or \u201cpirate\u201d status.\nCHERIAN THACHENKARY\nAtlanta"
