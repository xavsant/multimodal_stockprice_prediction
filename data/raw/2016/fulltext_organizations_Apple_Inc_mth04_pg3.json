        "title": "On Encryption Battle, Apple Has Advocates in Ex-National Security Officials",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In their years together as top national security officials, Michael V. Hayden and Michael Chertoff were fierce advocates of using the government\u2019s spying powers to pry into sensitive intelligence data.\nMr. Hayden directed a secret domestic eavesdropping program at the National Security Agency that captured billions of phone records after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Chertoff pushed for additional wiretapping and surveillance powers from Congress both as a top prosecutor and as Homeland Security secretary.\nBut today, their jobs have changed, and so, apparently, have their views on privacy. Both former officials now work with technology companies like Apple at a corporate consulting firm that Mr. Chertoff founded, and both are now backing Apple \u2014 and not the F.B.I., with which they once worked \u2014 in its fight to keep its iPhones encrypted and private.\nThey are among more than a half-dozen prominent former national security officials who, to varying degrees, have supported Apple and the idea of impenetrable \u201cend-to-end encryption\u201d during a furious national debate over the balance between privacy and security in the digital age.\nIn white papers, op-ed articles, conferences, newspaper and television interviews and elsewhere, the former officials have made their support for Apple clear. While their former jobs in the government are always featured prominently in their public appearances, their current business affiliations often go unmentioned.\nThe barrage of support has given Apple a public relations boost in a fight it once seemed destined to lose, but it has surprised and angered some law enforcement officials.\nThese officials question whether the business relationships that some of the former officials now have with Apple and other Silicon Valley companies \u2014 jobs that usually pay far above their former government salaries \u2014 are behind their enthusiastic advocacy of privacy and encryption.\nAmong those who have voiced support for Apple\u2019s position are Mike McConnell, a former director of national intelligence; David H. Petraeus, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; R. James Woolsey, another former C.I.A. director; and Richard A. Clarke, a former top White House counterterrorism official. Like Mr. Chertoff and Mr. Hayden, they all now work with firms that have ties to the technology sector, records show.\nIt is unclear how much money Apple and other technology firms involved in the F.B.I. litigation have paid to the firms where the former officials now work; most of the firms declined to discuss their private business dealings, calling them irrelevant.\nMr. McConnell, who served as national intelligence director under President Obama and George W. Bush, argues that keeping the United States\u2019 computer systems safe from rival nations and rogue hackers should outweigh the F.B.I.\u2019s interests in unlocking smartphones in criminal cases.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\n\u201cI believe ubiquitous encryption is something that the nation is going to have to embrace,\u201d Mr. McConnell, who is now a senior executive adviser at the consulting giant Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a telephone interview. \u201cApple has been leading the fight to go down that path, Google is right behind and Microsoft will be there before too long.\u201d\nBooz Allen\u2019s executive vice president, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard commandant, has also voiced support for Apple\u2019s position on encryption, because, he said, American technology firms need to stay competitive in the international market.\nBooz Allen has made a recent push to form \u201cstrategic alliances\u201d with Apple and other technology companies, executives said.\nMr. McConnell and other former national security officials said that their work in the private sector had no impact on their public support for Apple. Not everyone agrees.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve followed the money and adopted pro-privacy positions that they wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of taking while in government,\u201d said Tim Shorrock, a writer and foreign policy commentator who wrote a book on the business side of intelligence.\nSome current law enforcement officials say they have been angered by the former officials\u2019 sharp and sometimes personal criticism of the F.B.I. (Mr. Hayden, for instance, said in an interview, \u201cI think Jim Comey\u2019s wrong,\u201d referring to the bureau\u2019s director.)\nThe Justice Department and the F.B.I. declined to comment. But Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official who is one of the few former officials publicly backing the F.B.I. in the encryption debate, said it was frustrating to see old colleagues now echoing what he sees as erroneous assertions from Apple about the threat to its customers\u2019 privacy.\nStill, he conceded that the efforts had been effective. What started as a dispute over a locked iPhone used by a terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif., has instead become a broader one over privacy and computer security, Mr. Baker said, and \u201cthey\u2019re getting a lot of people to side with Apple.\u201d\nSo strong is their support that Apple has included comments from several of the former officials in its legal pleadings. One filing included a comment from Mr. Chertoff at a conference last month that if Apple were forced to create a \u201cback door\u201d to get around its encryption, it would be like creating \u201ca bacteriological weapon.\u201d\nAnother vote of support that Apple has included in its legal filings came from Mr. Hayden, who is one of the top executives at Mr. Chertoff\u2019s consulting firm, the Chertoff Group. \u201cAmerica is more secure \u2014 America is more safe \u2014 with unbreakable end-to-end encryption,\u201d Mr. Hayden, who led both the National Security Agency and the C.I.A., told a television interviewer a week after the Apple fight broke out.\nMr. Chertoff\u2019s firm also produced a 28-page report this year on the value of encryption, and its dealings with technology companies on security issues are extensive. Apple was also a corporate sponsor of a cybersecurity conference it hosted in October.\nMr. Hayden has acknowledged that he might have come down differently in the Apple dispute when he was the head of the N.S.A. If faced with an unbreakable device, he might have gone straight to the budget office and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to need another $500 million because I\u2019m going to kick my way in,\u201d he told the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\nStill, Mr. Hayden said in a telephone interview that his strong stance on encryption dated back years and was not influenced by his post-government work at the Chertoff Group.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any relevance to what I think about this,\u201d he said. \u201cI answered this on its merits.\u201d\nMr. Chertoff was traveling and unavailable for comment, the Chertoff Group said. The firm declined to discuss its financial dealings with Apple.\nBut Mr. Chertoff acknowledged in a panel discussion last month that during his time inside the government, there were situations in which \u201cI knew I had to move heaven and earth\u201d to find out where a threat was coming from. His current focus on encryption, he said, is complementary to that previous stance on security and not contradictory.\nThe encryption debate erupted in February after the F.B.I. said it needed Apple\u2019s technical help to get into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers.\nInitially, the F.B.I. appeared poised to win the battle for public opinion. The attack, which killed 14 people, was the worst terrorist strike on American soil since the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Farook was dead; the phone\u2019s owner \u2014 the county of San Bernardino, where he worked \u2014 had consented to the search; and the Justice Department had a court order to do it.\nBut Apple has since gained public sympathy, with polls giving it a small but growing edge over the F.B.I. in support, and the battle has essentially ended ina drawnow that the F.B.I. has managed to get into the phone by paying an outside group to help hack it.\nWith the F.B.I. still pushing to open other locked phones, Apple\u2019s backers are preparing for a long fight.\nMr. Hayden, the former N.S.A. director, warned listeners last month at the American Enterprise Institute that the flare-up in the San Bernardino case was \u201cnot a one-and-done.\u201d\nEncryption is at the root of Internet communications, Mr. Hayden said, and \u201cthere is nothing we can do to stop that.\u201d His advice to his onetime government colleagues on the other side of the fight was simple: \u201cGet over it,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "HONG KONG \u2014 Since 2010, Yu Kai has followed the ritual every year: When a new Apple iPhone comes out, he gets rid of his old one and heads to a store in Beijing to buy the latest model.\nThis year, however, he held back.\nInstead of buying the iPhone 6s, he has been waiting to see what the next iPhone looks like, and he said he might even switch to a model by a different maker.\nIn China, where Apple has been a signifier of wealth and fashion, and where many Chinese update their smartphones each year, Mr. Yu is not an outlier.\nApple\u2019s second-quarterearnings reporton Tuesday showed how hard it can be to keep the attention of China\u2019s fickle and increasingly hard-to-impress consumers. Timothy D. Cook, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in an earnings call that sales in mainland China had fallen 11 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.\nMr. Cook noted that sales had dropped from a high level: In the first quarter of 2015, sales were 80 percent higher than in the same period in 2014. But the decline announced on Tuesday is a setback for one of the most beloved brands in China.\nChina\u2019s young, middle-class consumers are increasingly willing, analysts say, to try phones from the many competitors \u2014 including Huawei, Meizu and Xiaomi \u2014 that seek to compete with Apple on technical specifications and aesthetics but that offer their models at a few hundred dollars cheaper.\nMany customers like Mr. Yu, who is 29 and self-employed, consider the phone they use part of theirpersonal identity, leading them to look at a broad range of available models. That being the case, Apple will have to fight to maintain its dominance of the high end of the market.\nApple also faces other obstacles in China. Last week, the company\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies services wereshut downby a Chinese regulator, just six months after they started operating. The rare about-face by China suggests that Apple could face further pressure as the Chinese government increases its scrutiny of American companies\u2019 operations within its borders.\nIn the past four years, with strong demand in China for its products, Apple increased the number of retail stores in the country to 35 from just a handful, and Mr. Cook said on Tuesday that there would be 40 by the end of June. The company has also been able to tap into the enormous customer base of China\u2019s largest wireless carrier, China Mobile, after years of talks resulted in anagreement in 2013that brought the iPhone to the carrier. The deal contributed to Chinese consumers spending $59 billion on Apple products in the latest fiscal year.\nBut one challenge for Apple\u2019s sales this year is that its most recent models do not represent a big leap from the previous generation.\n\u201cEveryone bought a 6 series,\u201d Steven C. Pelayo, a technology analyst at HSBC in Hong Kong, said by email, referring to models introduced in late 2014. They \u201cwere less inclined to upgrade to a 6s, which only had very minor changes,\u201d he added.\nQu Dewei, who has been selling smartphones for four years in a technology mall in eastern Beijing, said it had been tough to sell iPhones since September, when the iPhone 6s came out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been bad since then, it\u2019s been really bad,\u201d Mr. Qu said as he leaned on the counter at his stall. On Wednesday afternoon, the mall where he works was largely empty.\n\u201cNone of the brands do really great,\u201d he said. \u201cBut while I might sell one or two Huawei phones in 10 days, I may not even sell one iPhone 6s.\u201d\nFor years, smugglers have done a brisk business taking iPhones to mainland China from Hong Kong, where they cost less. But even the illegal sellers are feeling the pressure. In interviews, four smugglers who did well a year ago said they had now quit the trade.\nThe iPhone\u2019s weaker sales also reflect the broader slowdown in growth in China\u2019s enormous smartphone market. Jason Low, an analyst in Shanghai with the research group Canalys, said he expected the Chinese smartphone market to grow only 4.7 percent in 2016. As recently as 2013, it was growing 50 percent annually.\n\u201cIf you look at the entire market, Apple cannot fight off so many competitors, like Samsung and local brands like Huawei and Oppo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all trying to raise the average selling price, and that will bleed into Apple\u2019s sales flow.\u201d\nDespite the pressure, Mr. Cook said in the earnings call on Tuesday that Apple was \u201coptimistic\u201d about China, even if it was losing ground.There is even a precedentfor an Apple recovery: In 2012 and 2013, the company\u2019s sales growth in China slowed as competitors like Samsung offered phones with larger screens, which are very popular in China. When Apple finally released a phone with a similar screen size in 2014, its market share roared back.\nIn many ways, the company is in a similar position today. Samsung\u2019s Edge phones stand out with screens that have rounded edges on one side, and many in China say the camera on Huawei\u2019s flagship model is better than Apple\u2019s camera. That puts more pressure on Apple to pack new features into the next iPhone, which is expected to come out this autumn.\nFor Mo Chen, a 26-year-old public relations professional who owns an iPhone 5, the next Apple smartphone will have to do much more than her current model for her to be tempted.\nShe was blunt in her criticism: \u201cThe iPhone 6 and 6s are really ugly.\u201d\nMany of Ms. Mo\u2019s co-workers and former classmates use Android phones, she said, and she is considering switching to a device by the South Korean company or to a Chinese phone made by ZTE or One Plus.\n\u201cI like Apple a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI use an Apple computer. But in recent years, especially after I tried my friends\u2019 Android phones, I realized that the brand has lost a bit of its charm.\u201d"

        "title": "U.S. Presses Bid to Force Apple to Unlock iPhone in New York",
        "fulltext": "WASHINGTON \u2014 With the legal battle over one iPhone now behind them, lawyers for the Justice Department and Apple resumed their sparring in another case on Friday, as prosecutors told a federal judge in Brooklyn that they still needed the company\u2019s help to unlock a drug dealer\u2019s iPhone.\nWhile prosecutors described the demand in the Brooklyn case as routine, Apple said it reflected an attempt by the government to establish a precedent that could help unlock dozens or even hundreds of other phones.\nIndeed, a judge in yet another case revolving around a locked iPhone \u2014 one in Boston involving a violent gang conspiracy \u2014 has directed Apple to help the Federal Bureau of Investigation extract data from the phone, according to documents unsealed on Friday.\nThe cases in Brooklyn and Boston represent the latest battlegrounds in the unusually prominent dispute between the government and Apple over the F.B.I.\u2019s difficulties in breaking into encrypted phones.\nThe Justice Department said it was proceeding with its appeal of a February ruling that rejected its demand for Apple\u2019s assistance in the Brooklyn case, even after the F.B.I. managed in recent weeks to unlock, without the company\u2019s help, an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\u201cThe government\u2019s application is not moot and the government continues to require Apple\u2019s assistance in accessing the data that it is authorized to search by warrant,\u201d prosecutors said.\nEmily Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the technological solution found in the San Bernardino case would not work to get into the phone of the Brooklyn drug dealer, which has a different operating system.\n\u201cIn this case, we still need Apple\u2019s help in accessing the data, which they have done with little effort in at least 70 other cases when presented with court orders for comparable phones running iOS 7 or earlier operating systems,\u201d she said.\nApple\u2019s lawyers are skeptical of the F.B.I.\u2019s claims that it cannot simply use the San Bernardino method to get into the Brooklyn phone.\nThe fight over the San Bernardino phone ended abruptly last month after the F.B.I. paid an undisclosed outside party to demonstrate how to get around two defense mechanisms built into the iPhone 5c. It isunclearwhether the F.B.I. got much of use out of the phone.\nIn the Brooklyn case, prosecutors want to open an iPhone 5s owned byJun Feng, 45, a methamphetamine dealer who claimed to have forgotten his passcode. Mr. Feng has pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the case, but prosecutors say his phone could hold information leading to other suspects.\nIn a stinging rebuke five weeks ago, however, Magistrate Judge James Orenstein said in a 50-page ruling that the Justice Department had overstepped its authority in trying to use a 1789 statute called the All Writs Act to compel Apple\u2019s cooperation.\nThe technology company has been locked in a major legal battle against law enforcement officials over privacy and security.\nApple had previously agreed without objection to help unlock dozens of phones in federal investigations, but it changed its position late last year, saying that the F.B.I.\u2019s demands could cause \u201creputational harm\u201d as it promotes the security of its devices.\nAn Apple lawyer said the company was disappointed but not surprised by the government\u2019s decision to press ahead in Brooklyn.\nThe lawyer, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity because of company policy, argued that prosecutors were pushing the case not because of the value of the information in the phone, but rather to set a precedent that could be used to get into other locked iPhones.\nA ruling in the government\u2019s favor in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn would not be binding in other cases, but if it were appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and upheld there, it would become precedent for other federal courts in the region.\nJustice Department lawyers point to Apple\u2019s past cooperation in arguing that it should be compelled to unlock Mr. Feng\u2019s phone. But Joseph DeMarco, a former prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said that alone would not be enough to overturn Judge Orenstein\u2019s order.\n\u201cApple can still argue that it doesn\u2019t have to comply with this order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that it has done so before is relevant but not, as a technical matter, legally binding.\u201d\nThe method used by the F.B.I. to get into the San Bernardino phone has been a topic of furious speculation at Apple and among encryption experts.\nThe Apple lawyer said on Friday that the company had decided not to sue the F.B.I. to find out how it got into the phone, in part because Apple\u2019s regular product updates would probably give the method a short shelf life.\nThe company works constantly to find and fix vulnerabilities, and its lawyers said they were confident that it would render useless the tool used by the F.B.I. in the San Bernardino case, even if it never knew for sure the method involved.\nThe company\u2019s lawyers plan to argue that the San Bernardino phone used a new operating system and was much harder to break into than the phone in the Brooklyn case would be. With a higher bar set, the company will question why the government cannot turn to the same marketplace of technicians that helped it crack the San Bernardino phone.\nApple executives, including Timothy D. Cook, the chief, argue that Congress, not the courts, should set broad policies on investigators\u2019 access to encrypted data.\nA bill being drafted by the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 Richard M. Burr, a North Carolina Republican, and Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat \u2014 would compel companies to provide \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d to law enforcement officials in such cases, according tothe newspaper The Hill.\nBut many officials in Washington doubt that a divided Congress will be able to reach agreement on such a complicated issue, and the draft bill drew quick protests even before its release, with the American Civil Liberties Union calling it \u201ca clear threat to everyone\u2019s privacy and security.\u201d"
