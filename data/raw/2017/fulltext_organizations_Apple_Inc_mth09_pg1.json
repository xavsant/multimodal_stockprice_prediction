        "title": "Canada Letter: The Avro Arrow and an Amazon HQ",
        "fulltext": "Time has only increased interest among Canadians in the Avro Arrow supersonic fighter jet that was abruptly canceled by the government in 1959, putting at least 25,000 people out of work.\nWhile reporting recently on the hunt for Arrow relics in Lake Ontario, I asked why so many Canadians still care, or even know, about an unproven jet fighter that never entered military service.\nMany people suggested that Arrow mythology was based on what might have been. In concept, the Arrow was the most advanced airplane of its time. Had it been fully developed, many people told me, Canada would have become a major force in aviation. (Several Canadian companies, notably Bombardier and CAE, nevertheless grew into major international aerospace players.)\nBut almost everyone I met also mentioned the government\u2019s campaign to seemingly wipe away all traces of the Arrow. The six complete planes and the partially built ones on the assembly line were cut into pieces and many of their blueprints were destroyed, as was the manufacturing machinery.\nThe effort to erase the Arrow is usually attributed to John Diefenbaker, the volatile prime minister who canceled the program.\nBut several historians pointed me to a meticulously researchedgraduate thesis paperon the Arrow by Russell Isinger, who is now the registrar at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. In it, he clears Mr. Diefenbaker.\nThrough military and government documents, he found that the complete planes were offered to aviation research organizations in Canada, the United States and Britain. All of them said, no, thanks, apparently because of the cost of keeping a small fleet of orphaned planes flying.\nThe destruction that followed, Mr. Isinger found, was not \u201cnot out of Diefenbaker\u2019s vindictiveness\u201d but was \u201csimply due to bureaucratic standard operating procedure.\u201d\nRead:Hunting for a Canadian Legend: the Avro Arrow Jet Fighter\nAmazon, the online retail giant, is shopping. It wants to supplement its current head office with a second one somewhere else in North America. The location was not limited to the United States. That led several Canadian mayors to say thatthey plan to make bidsto host the complex, which holds out the promise of 50,000 jobs and a $5 billion investment.\nMy colleagues atThe Upshot,who specialize in making sense of data, took Amazon\u2019s criteria and crunched the numbers to help the company with its selection. (Hint: the prospective winner is in a Western state with lots of altitude.) Canadian cities weren\u2019t included in the data sets available to The Upshot so Canada was excluded. But MountainMath, a data analysis company in Vancouver, British Columbia,picked up the task.Its Canadian winner is not one that comes up frequently in most speculation: Calgary, Alberta. The consensus in the Canadian news media is that thecountry shouldn\u2019t be counting its chickens.\nRead:Dear Amazon, We Picked Your New Headquarters for You\nRead:Amazon Plans Second Headquarters, Opening a Bidding War Among Cities\nApple on Tuesday marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone by unveiling three new phones (four if you count the Apple Watch that can make calls). By coincidence that same day, I came across a folder with material from when I interviewed Steve Jobs shortly before the first Macintosh computer was unveiled in 1984. (At the time, I worked for Maclean\u2019s magazine.)\nApple product launches were certainly less slick back then. The key handout for the Mac was a four-page, black-and-white photocopy with crude graphics made with the new Mac.\nWhen we met, Mr. Jobs switched on the new computer and declared it to be \u201cinsanely great.\u201d The phrase ultimately became so associated with Mr. Jobs that it was the title of a recentgraphic biography of his lifeby Jessie Hartland.\nBut a spokeswoman sitting in during the interview on Jan. 12, 1984, would have nothing to do with that sentiment, interrupting Mr. Jobs to say: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be \u2018insanely great\u2019.\u201d\nNever modest, Mr. Jobs said that the Mac was as great an advance over other computers as the telephone was over the telegraph.\nGrowing increasingly excited (according to my musty transcript), Mr. Jobs predicted that the Mac would give Apple sales of $10 billion by the end of the decade. That didn\u2019t pan out. In 1990 its sales were $5.5 billion. The company, of course, eventually far outstripped Mr. Jobs\u2019s dreams and reported sales last year of $215.6 billion.\nIn 1984, growth worried Mr. Jobs as much as it excited him. He brought up Xerox, which developed some of the innovations that thensurfaced in the first Mac. \u201cWhat happened as it became a multibillion-dollar corporation?\u201d Mr. Jobs asked. \u201cIt lost its way somehow, it lost its culture, it lost its spirit and ultimately it lost the ability to attract and retain great people.\u201d\nKeeping Apple from that fate, he suggested, required him to be a demanding boss.\n\u201cI really want to set an expectation of nothing short of great, and there are some people that are interested in doing adequate stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people and I don\u2019t get along very well.\u201d\nAbout a year later Mr. Jobs was ousted from Apple, and he didn\u2019t return until 1997.\nRead:Answers to Your Questions About Apple\u2019s New iPhones\nRead:At the Apple Keynote, Selling Us a Better Vision of Ourselves\nRead:Apple Unveils iPhone X and 8 Models as It Upgrades TV Set-Top Box\nMany people at The Times, including me, tell you what\u2019s happening in the world. But some of my colleagues write about how to improve your health and lives in general. Here are some of the most popular such stories last month:\nRead:Hire Women Your Mom\u2019s Age\nRead:Researchers Track an Unlikely Culprit in Weight Gain\nRead:How Much Protein Do We Need?\n\u25a0 Maurice Bluestein thought that early wind chill tables exaggerated the effects of cold winds. Joining a Canadian researcher, he took new measurements, revised tables and created the system now used in Canada. He died last month andhis obituaryincludes, for the mathematically inclined, the formula for calculating the apparent effects of winter\u2019s frosty blast.\n\u25a0 Arare judicial disciplinary hearingdidn\u2019t buy the argument of a judge from Hamilton, Ontario, that wearing a Trump campaign hat into court and suggesting that he backed the new American president was just a bit of harmless kidding around. The judge\u2019s pay was docked, but he will remain on the bench.\n\u25a0 At the Toronto International Film Festival,horror moviesget respect. So doesthe fashion world."

        "title": "Farhad\u2019s and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: A Very Bad Week for Digital Giants",
        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad:Good morning, Mike! How was your week? I\u2019ve been busy trying to get my digital life in order. For instance, I\u2019ve decided to check my email just twice a day, and I\u2019m carrying around my Kindle so that when I get the urge to check Twitter on my phone, I read a book instead. I have high hopes that it will make me fitter, happier and more productive. What do you think?\nMike:Um, no wonder it\u2019s taking so long for you to respond to my emails. I\u2019m going to start texting you my email threads instead. Prepare for a lot of chain letters.\nFarhad:Great. Well, let\u2019s talk tech. First, quickly:Google is spending $1.1 billion to hire about 2,000 employees from HTC, the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that has run into financial problems. Google and HTC have long been partners \u2014 HTC made Google\u2019s Pixel smartphone \u2014 so this deal effectively creates a more tightly integrated team for building Google\u2019s hardware. And Google has bet big on hardware lately. On that note: Nest, one of Google\u2019s sister companies,unveiled a set of home security gadgets this week.\nI wish I had some sparkling insight to offer here to make sense of all this. Why is Google, which has repeatedly failed to make it big in hardware, spending so much to become a big player? But the answer is really straightforward: because it has the money, so why not? We\u2019re at that stage in the tech industry where every one of the five tech giants is doing everything, because their money is endless and their appetites are ferocious. There is not much more to it than that.\nMike:I honestly am a bit confused here. Remember the Motorola debacle from a few years back? Google paid more than$12 billion to buy Motorola Mobility, another struggling handset maker, in an attempt to take on Apple more directly and own the hardware stack from top to bottom.\nThat didn\u2019t work out so well. Google ended up selling Motorola for parts after it realized that, uh, no one wanted to buy Motorola phones.\nSome people are saying this is about gaining more expertise inside Google for building hardware. O.K., I guess. But let\u2019s hope it works out better than last time.\nFarhad:Let\u2019s turn to Apple, Facebook and Amazon, since they all had a rough week. For Apple, it was about a buggy smartwatch. The new Apple Watch is supposed to work on cellular networks, meaning it can reach the internet even if you\u2019re away from your phone. Our own reviewer, Brian X. Chen,found that it worked quite well, but reviewers atThe Wall Street JournalandThe Vergediscovered a flaw in the devices that prevented them from reaching cellular networks in some instances. Apple said it would fix the bug in a software update, but it\u2019s still an embarrassing slip from a company that prides itself on getting things perfect.\nMike:Do we have to call this one \u201cWatchgate?\u201d I swear, every few iPhone launches we see some damning flaw in the hardware, and it takes a little shine off their huge annual product introductions.\nHowever, people will still buy their new iPhones in droves, as they always do. Probably the new watch, too. And to be fair to Apple, at least they aren\u2019t shipping phones thatexplode in your pantspocket.\nFarhad:Facebook, meanwhile, had to scramble tofix its ad targeting engineafter ProPublica found that advertisers could use the system to target ads using racial slurs\u2014for instance,people could show ads to \u201cJew haters.\u201dOther reporters soon found that Google\u2019s and Twitter\u2019s ad systems could also be used to target heinous categories. Coming on top of reports that Russia used Facebook\u2019s ad system to manipulate the American election, the stories fed the perception that these companies just don\u2019t know how their systems are being used.\nMike:And don\u2019t forget thatFacebook finally came out with a nine-point liston how the company plans to comply with continuing investigations into Russian-linked ads and even begin some forms of self-regulation for political ads on Facebook. It\u2019s a huge story.\nFarhad:Oh, for further evidence of the cluelessness of tech companies over their platforms,Amazon\u2019s website has been recommending bomb-making materials to people, a British report found. Boy oh boy. Remember when tech was fun and zany, when it was all about getting cool gadgets? We\u2019re long past that.\nMike:I started playing a video game the other day that\u2019s basically Grand Theft Auto meets San Francisco hackers. Part of the game includes making guns from a 3-D printer. The future is terrifying.\nFarhad:The rapidly deteriorating image of tech companies is having real-world consequences. Our colleague Cecilia Kang reported that Facebook and Google have lost so much clout in Washington thatthey\u2019ve all but given up trying to stop a sex-trafficking billthat they think could have negative consequences for their businesses. The bill would allow people to sue some websites for the content they host \u2014 a huge change to existing law, which doesn\u2019t hold companies responsible for stuff their users post on their sites, as long as they work to take down illegal material.\nInternet giants were gearing up to fight the law, but they\u2019ve determined that the growing anti-tech sentiment makes it too difficult. It\u2019s hard out there for a tech giant \u2014 other than all those billions of dollars they keep raking in.\nMike:Right, and I think tech companies have grown wise to where the tide is turning. Right now, we\u2019re seeing Facebook try to get ahead of Congress by announcing that it wants to essentially regulate its own political ads, largely because it doesn\u2019t want Congress to intervene. Also, I can only imagine that Google, Twitter and Amazon are bracing for the possibility of this story picking apart their businesses, too.\nIn any case, the future is scary! Should we trust these tech companies that say they\u2019ve got it covered, and have our best interests in hand?\nFarhad:Um \u2026 probably not? O.K., see ya.\nMike:Ta ta for now!"

        "title": "Recovery From Two Hurricanes, and German Automakers Look Forward",
        "fulltext": "Here\u2019s what to expect in the week ahead:\nECONOMY\nAs Texas continues to recover from Hurricane Harvey, businesses and residents in Florida will begin to assess the damages from Irma. Early reporting on the effects of the Houston storm showed that financial markets wereless skittishthan expected, and some analysts even predicted amodest economic bumpin the region, spurred by construction projects as people restore their properties.Zach Wichter\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nThe auto industry is expected to receive guidelines from the Trump administration on Tuesday about how autonomous vehicles will be regulated in the future.Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao will make a \u201cspecial announcement\u201drelated to the emerging technology at the self-driving test facility at the University of Michigan, where she will be joined by Mitch Bainwol, the president of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. The event follows theHouse\u2019s passage of legislation last weekthat would allow individual carmakers to test up to 100,000 driverless vehicles on the nation\u2019s roads per year.Bill Vlasic\nTheInternational Motor Showbegins in Frankfurt amid one of the worst crises to hit the German auto industry since the end of World War II. The huge exhibition, which opens to the news media on Tuesday and the public on Saturday, is traditionally an occasion for Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen to celebrate their domination of the high end of the car market. But this year, the companies havefaced widespread criticismfor deceiving the public about the health risks posed by the diesel passenger cars that they produce in enormous numbers. The automakers will do their best to look past the diesel issue and focus on their plans for electric and self-driving cars. The motor show, held in Frankfurt every two years, continues through Sept. 24.Jack Ewing\nBANKING\nAt a financial services conference in New York on Tuesday morning, Harvey Schwartz, the president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs, will present his firm\u2019s current outlook. Attendees will probably be listening closely for any new details on Goldman\u2019s plans to bolster its ailing bond division. Historically a crucial component of Goldman\u2019s profits, bond trading revenues have beendented this yearby an unfavorable mix of clients, ongoing regulatory curbs on riskier trading and losses on natural gas positions. Amid those troubles, Greg Agran, the head of commodities, hasannounced his plans to leavethe firm. Analysts expect to see more evidence of retrenchment in the coming quarters.Kate Kelly\nTECHNOLOGY\nOn Tuesday, Apple willunveil its latest lineupof iPhones, including a special 10th anniversary edition that willstart at about $1,000. The new phone will feature an edge-to-edge screen, facial recognition and augmented reality software. The company is also expected to announce an array of other products, including a Watch with a cellular data connection.Vindu Goel\nECONOMY\nThe Census Bureauwill publisha snapshot of America\u2019s economic welfare on Tuesday, including the median household income in 2016, the prevalence of poverty and the share of Americans covered by health insurance. Last year,the news was good. The government reported that the median household income rose sharply after years of stagnation, although the median income remained below the precrisis peak in 2007. The latest report is expected to show further progress.Binyamin Appelbaum\nThe Bank of England will release its latest decision on interest rates on Thursday. The Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady, but the decision comes as some members of the committee have become increasingly concerned about inflation. At its last meeting in August, the committeevoted 6 to 2to keep its benchmark interest rate at a historic low of 0.25 percent.\nBut Michael Saunders, a committee member who voted to raise rates,said in a speechlast month that a \u201cmodest rise\u201d in interest rates was needed to ensure that the inflation returns to the central bank\u2019s target over time.\nIn itslatest inflation forecastin August, the Bank of England said it expected inflation to peak at 3 percent in October. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, said at the time that inflation was expected to ease early next year and reduce pressure on household incomes.Chad Bray\nOn Thursday, the Labor Department will report August data on the Consumer Price Index. Economists expect overall prices to show a 0.3 percent increase while the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors, is estimated to have inched up by 0.2 percent. Rising energy prices are thought to have moved the index higher last month, a trend which will probably continue in September. The core may show the effect of rising prices for imports, which are being pushed up by theweak dollar.Nelson D. Schwartz\nA new British 10 pound notebearing the likeness of the novelist Jane Austengoes into circulation on Thursday in England and Wales. The bank note, worth about $13, is the second to be printed by the Bank of England using apolymer materialinstead of special cotton paper. The bill will join its cousin, the \u00a35 note featuring the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which was introduced last year.\nThe new bills are supposed to last longer than traditional paper notes, and are able to withstand a washing machine cycle. The new notes also include updated security features to discourage counterfeiting. The final design was unveiled in July, timed to mark the 200th anniversary of Jane Austen\u2019s death. She is replacing Charles Darwin on the \u00a310 note.Chad Bray\nAUTO INDUSTRY\nMary Barra, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, will attend a ceremony in Shanghai on Friday to mark the sale of the 15 millionth car by G.M.\u2019s main joint venture in China, which startedmaking cars in China in 1998. She is expected to talk about G.M.\u2019s activities and plans in the world\u2019s largest car market. She will also join an annual meeting of foreign business leaders with the city\u2019s top officials. Han Zheng, the party secretary of Shanghai, is a possible candidate to join the Standing Committee of the Politburo, the handful of top Communist leaders who run China, at the twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress in Beijing starting on Oct. 18.Keith Bradsher"

        "title": "At the Apple Keynote, Selling Us a Better Vision of Ourselves",
        "fulltext": "Talking about the new iPhone\u2019s augmented-reality features at Apple\u2019s announcement event Tuesday, Philip W. Schiller, the senior vice president for worldwide marketing, showed how an app could overlay an image of the constellations on a live camera picture of the sky. This got him excited. \u201cThis isn\u2019t some generic sky!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the sky around you!\u201d\nI don\u2019t know. It looked like a generic sky to me: clouds, blue, sunlight.\nBut itdidlook better on the phone \u2014 or rather, on an image of a phone, projected on a screen in Cupertino, Calif., streamed to my computer. It was luminous. The constellation labels, appearing and fading, gave it a look of magical whimsy.\nI looked up through the skylight over my desk. Yep. That iPhone sky looked way better than the garbage regular sky that I could see through my garbage human eyes.\nThis enhancement of reality is what each video-streamed Apple event sells, more than any particular iPhone or set-top box. If advertising once told us that \u201cThings go better with Coke,\u201d this event \u2014 a jewel box for Apple\u2019s products and the people who use them \u2014 says that \u201cThings look better with Apple.\u201d\nThis year is the 10th anniversary of the iPhone. It\u2019s also the 10th anniversary of the Apple keynote at which Steve Jobs announced the original device. The first one was a tour de force, Mr. Jobs leading a rapt audience as he asked them to imagine an iPod, a phone and a pocket internet device all in one.\nMr. Jobs, who died in 2011, loomed over Tuesday\u2019s nostalgic presentation. The Apple C.E.O., Tim Cook, paid tribute, his voice cracking with emotion, Mr. Jobs\u2019s steeple-fingered image looming as big onstage as Big Brother\u2019s face inthe classic Macintosh \u201c1984\u201d commercial. Mr. Cook even revived Mr. Jobs\u2019s patented \u201cOne more thing ...\u201d line, but reverentially: \u201cWe have great respect for these words, and we don\u2019t use them lightly.\u201d\nThese online-streaming keynotes have become as important a production of Apple as the devices themselves. An Apple event is a distinct kind of TV special: an extended commercial \u2014 this one ran nearly two hours \u2014 that people watch willingly, to get a glimpse of the new products and an art-directed idea of their better selves.\nNew movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December.\nOn the massive screen, attractive young people ran with a billowing red sheet across a golden desert. Caped figures soared through clouds like angels in a gorgeous video game preview. A promo video for the Apple Watch as a fitness tool was so heartwarming and inspirational I think the Apple Watch may be running for president.\nAngela Ahrendts, Apple\u2019s senior vice president for retail, said new Apple stores would be rebranded Town Squares, places for community gathering, education \u2014 and buying the occasional thousand-dollar phone. (\u201cApple retail,\u201d Mr. Cook said, \u201chas always been about more than selling. It\u2019s about learning, inspiring and connecting with people.\u201d)\nYou will do such fantastic things with this technology, the presentation said. You\u2019ll get healthy! You\u2019ll learn! You\u2019ll play ennobling games!\nThough Mr. Jobs is gone, his minimalist aesthetic lives on in Cupertino, in the products and on the stage. Everything was set off against a black screen, like diamond necklaces in a velvet case. The show opened with footage of the sun rising (or setting? Surely it was rising) over the curvilinear new Steve Jobs Theater, where the event took place.\nMr. Cook is an amiable presenter, but he doesn\u2019t pretend to have Mr. Jobs\u2019s magnetism. Wearing a zippered fleece \u2014 rich-guy casualwear as opposed to Mr. Jobs\u2019s aesthete\u2019s turtlenecks \u2014 he passed the spotlight around to associates. Among them was the designer Jonathan Ive, speaking from a white room in tandem with an animated monkey emoji.\nThose \u201canimoji,\u201d controlled through face-recognition technology \u2014 yes, the poop emoji is in there \u2014 got a workout. You can read elsewhereabout the technical specsof the new hardware. But so much of the presentation was about images: the cameras, the edge-to-edge displays, the animation, emphasizing the extent to which Apple could be overlaid on the world to make it prettier, better, more fun.\nI\u2019m not going to pretend that I\u2019m immune to this allure. I watched the Apple keynote on my Apple iMac after getting a reminder on my Apple iPad and being unable to start a stream through the Apple events app on my Apple TV. A 1989 Mac Plus that I can\u2019t bear to part with still sits in my basement. I will almost certainly buy one of the new phones.\nWhat will I do with it? What does anyone? I will Instagram photos of my cooking that I think look more appetizing than they are. I will see another tweet from the president. I will Google song lyrics. I will read Facebook posts and get mad on the internet.\nAnd another year from now, I\u2019ll set another reminder to watch another Apple event, believing somewhere deep down that with one more upgrade, I might be perfected."

        "fulltext": "Each Friday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nMike:Ahoy, Farhad! Thanks for handling the newsletter while I was gone on vacation. I mostly hung around the Bay Area, which went through a heat wave of epic proportions. Despite paying obscene amounts of money to live here, none of us have air conditioning. So what I\u2019m saying is that I basically spent my vacation in a well-ventilated Starbucks.\nFarhad:Mike, every week we get one or two readers telling us they\u2019re unsubscribing because they hate our mindless chit-chat. It\u2019s sad, because mindless chit-chat is all we have to offer. But to keep it to a minimum this week, I won\u2019t say anything about how bad I feel for your fellow Starbucks refugees.\nMike:Right, well, please hang in there readers. I promise our personal anecdotes can occasionally be amusing. Sometimes I even visit the gym!\nMike:So let\u2019s get back into tech. This week, as you are quite well aware, isnew iPhone week. That usually means all other tech news is absorbed into the black hole that is the iPhone news cycle. But other interesting things happened this week, so let\u2019s get to those first.\nCan we start with Bodega? It\u2019s my favorite tech story of the week.\nFarhad:Yes, definitely \u2014 it instantly became a classic example of tech founders stepping into it on Day 1.\nMike:It has everything: Two ex-Google employees decided to launch a start-up focused onproviding the items you\u2019d normally find in a corner store\u2014 or bodega, as New Yorkers call them \u2014 but inside of a large, Ikea-like box. Their stated goal is to bring many of the daily items to people outside urban environments who don\u2019t have nearby, accessible corner stores. It\u2019s aided by machine learning and computer vision, two big Silicon Valley buzzwords.\nBut that is, uh, not how it came off to New Yorkers. The start-up called itself \u201cBodega,\u201d and theheadline on the first big articleabout the comapny focused on the potential elimination of mom-and-pop corner stores. Not exactly an endearing way to come out of the gate.\nThe internet went insane, and many, many follow-up articles condemning the company soon followed. Alas, the obligatory apologeticMedium postcame just a few hours later, though I\u2019m not sure how muchthat has assuaged the initial concerns.\nFarhad:People were justifiably upset that the founders seemed to be targeting mom-and-pop shops. What happened to the Silicon Valley idea that innovations were supposed to disrupt big guys, not struggling family-run businesses?\nBut even beyond that, Bodega\u2019s business model sounds rather questionable.As Helen Rosner argued in Eater, Bodega\u2019s plan to maintain thousands of these kiosks that each stock a slightly different mix of items seems pretty unworkable. Who will stock and maintain all those boxes? What sort of logistical pipeline will it involve? Beyond a branding fail, this sounds like a logistical nightmare.\nMike:Right. And while they claim they didn\u2019t really see the backlash coming, I like my friend Bobby McKenna\u2019s take on this: Every start-up needs avice president of common sense, with complete veto power over any controversial ideas. Perhaps that could be Bodega\u2019s next hire!\nMike:Moving right along, let\u2019s talk Apple a bit. After months of rumors and leaks, the company unveiled its new iPhones on Tuesday, making the biggest splash with the iPhone X. It\u2019s the 10th anniversary of the iPhone this year, so they wanted to make this release special.\nYou were there, in Apple\u2019s fancy new office complex, to take the whole thing in. Was it, in fact, special?\nFarhad:It wasone of the more interesting Apple eventsI\u2019ve been to in several years. The iPhone X is genuinely different from iPhones that have come before \u2014 it has a new interface, a new kind of screen technology, and it really does seem to mark a foundation for the future of these supercomputers. Also, the new headquarters is a sight to behold.\nI\u2019m not sure I loved the headquarters \u2014 it\u2019s very pretty but in an imposing, slightly scary way \u2014 but everything about it sure does ooze Apple\u2019s sensibility.\nMike:It was... interesting to see the whole thing play out on Twitter. It was like office porn, Pinterest-style. But I admit, I want to go check the place out now. Maybe they\u2019ll let me inside?\nButback to the phone: Other than facial recognition technology and an improved screen, should I spend $1,000 to buy a new iPhone? Mine is only a year old, and from what I could glean, this doesn\u2019t seem like an enormous step up in features. But perhaps I\u2019m jaded and need something whiz-bang fancy from new each release cycle to get me excited.\nFarhad:I only got to hold it for a few minutes. It seems like a very nice phone \u2014 the screen looked great, unlocking through facial-recognition seemed to work very well \u2014 but let\u2019s wait till the reviews are out.\nMike:Fair enough. I don\u2019t usually need to buy things right out of the gate, anyway.\nFarhad:OK, let\u2019s talk about Facebook. Ever since the companydisclosedthat a Russian troll farm had purchased ads on the site that may have influenced the election, Facebook has been under the gun from lawmakers to become a lot more transparent about what it plans to do to combat propaganda through the site.Now there are reportsthat Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into what happened in the 2016 election, has been focusing on the role of social media in the race.\nSo, what do you think? Should we expect Mark Zuckerberg to take the hot seat on Capitol Hill?\nMike:While I\u2019m not sure if Mr. Zuckerberg will go to Washington, the pressure on Facebook is certainly mounting in ways I have not seen before. You\u2019ve got Senator Mark Warner\u2019s office pressing intensely on this Russia issue. And, like you said, Facebook has finally disclosed what many have suspected for some time.\nI think the biggest takeaway for me has been the general shift in sentiment toward technology in general over the past year. It seems like the election was an inflection point for many who question whether Silicon Valley, which has completely changed the course of our world over the past few decades, is actually changing things for the better. While that may not be a new question, it\u2019s seeing new momentum in a world where Facebook ads and fake news may be more influential than we had thought.\nAnyway, I\u2019m staying away from politics and am on the hunt for my first Bodega in San Francisco, as I\u2019ve run out of toothpaste. Till next time!\nFarhad:Bye!"

        "title": "At $1,000, Apple\u2019s iPhone X Crosses a Pricing Threshold",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Apple unveils its new top-of-the-line iPhone on Tuesday, it isn\u2019t just expected to offer features likeinfrared facial recognitionand wireless charging for the first time.\nThe company will also enter new territory on price: The latest phone will start at about $1,000, compared with the $769 minimum for its current top phone, the iPhone 7 Plus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a whole new threshold,\u201d said Debby Ruth, a senior vice president at the tech consulting firm Frank N. Magid Associates. I really do think it\u2019s going to make people pause.\u201d\nFrom the iPhone\u2019s introduction a decade ago, Apple has always priced it as a premium product \u2014 a more refined and polished alternative to the legions of cheaper smartphones available in the market.\nBut this time, the company is pushing into luxury territory. The new phone will cost as much as the company\u2019s entry-level MacBook Air laptop. \u201cThey\u2019re doubling down on their strategy: They are going much more to the high end,\u201d Ms. Ruth said.\nApple declined to comment before the product announcements scheduled for Tuesday. (On Saturday, Steven Troughton-Smith, a developer who combed through the iOS 11 software,found references indicating that the new high-end phone will be called the iPhone X.)\nInvestors are betting that Apple\u2019s move up the price ladder will pay off with much higher profits, especially in mature markets like the United States and Western Europe, where many of the buyers will be people upgrading from older iPhones. The company\u2019s stock has risen by nearly 50 percent over the past year as anticipation has built about the 2017 models.\nApple\u2019s strategy carries risks, however, especially in developing countries where smartphone sales are growing briskly but its market share is a blip compared with devices running Google\u2019s Android software.\nIn Brazil, for example, Apple devices will account for just 8 percent of the 125 million active smartphone subscriptions this year, according to Forrester, a research firm.\nSteep taxes, higher retail profit margins, and added costs from a botched attempt at building iPhones in Brazil have pushed the price of an iPhone 6s, a two-year-old model, to more than $1,000 at Casa Bahia, a store in the Copacabana neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. In late August, the retailer was selling Apple\u2019s most basic smartphone, the iPhone SE, for more than $600, while a Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini, which runs Android, was just $136.\nAt another Rio store recently, Vanessa Perreira, 25, a university student, was browsing the 65 models on display, looking at the offerings from Samsung and LG but ignoring the six from Apple. She once owned an iPhone, she lamented, but could not afford to continue buying them. \u201cPrice is the most important factor for me,\u201d she said.\nStill, the iPhone is coveted by wealthier Brazilians, many of whom buy the phone while traveling abroad to avoid their country\u2019s high costs. \u201cThere will always be users in Brazil that will be interested in buying it,\u201d said Tina Lu, a senior analyst with Counterpoint Research.\nChina\u2019s reception to the $1,000 iPhone will be even more crucial to Apple. The Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, contributed $8 billion to Apple\u2019s revenue last quarter, but sales have been sluggish.\nBrian X. Chen, our lead consumer technology writer, gives answers to more than two dozen reader questions about Apple\u2019s new devices.\nApple\u2019s market share has declined slightly in China over the past year, according to Counterpoint. High-end phones from Chinese brands like Huawei and Oppo have gained ground, in part by undercutting Apple on price.\nThe new iPhone has the potential to reverse that trend. More than any other tech product, the iPhone has long denoted status in China. If a new iPhone looks the same as the previous one \u2014 and won\u2019t be recognized by others as new \u2014 it often doesn\u2019t sell well.\n\u201cIf the phone\u2019s appearance changes, I think people are going to be crazy about it, because we\u2019ve seen the iPhone with a similar look for such a long time now,\u201d said He Peihuan, a Shanghai-based financial analyst.\nApple has also faced pressure from the Chinese government. State-run media outlets have called attention to a feature that tracked a user\u2019s most commonly visited locations and also criticized the company\u2019s after-sales policies. And government employees and leaders at state-run companies try to avoid being seen using foreign technologies like the iPhone.\nFor all that, Zhang Xiang, a phone reseller and repairman in Shanghai, said that he still expected strong demand for the new iPhone. \u201cI think when people can afford it and want a high-end phone with good features, they\u2019ll still choose to buy an iPhone,\u201d he said.\nOne important factor offsetting the next iPhone\u2019s expected high price is the increasing prevalence of financing options for buyers around the globe. In the United States, most phone carriers allow customers to spread the cost of a new phone over two years, and the new phone would add less than $10 a month to the payments a customer would make on an iPhone 7 Plus.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not that much difference in the monthly fee you have to pay,\u201d said Brian Blau, a technology analyst at Gartner, a research firm.\nSimilar installment purchase plans are emerging in China, Brazil and other countries, making Apple\u2019s products more affordable there.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen some banks providing installment plans for the iPhone with very low, or even no interest, so ordinary people could get an iPhone that way,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\nNeil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst who writes at the siteAbove Avalon, said that he would be looking to see what Apple says about lower-priced models on Tuesday. Analysts already expect the company to announce two phones that are upgrades of the existing iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and will be priced at similar levels to those phones\u2019 current prices. But if the company also offers a model below $400, particularly in developing countries, that could help lure a new generation of users onto the iPhone platform, he said.\nThat would play into Satish Meena\u2019s theory of iPhone adoption in developing countries.\nMr. Meena, a senior forecast analyst at Forrester who is based in New Delhi, said that in places like India and Brazil, where millions of new smartphone users are entering the market, the first phone that people buy is a cheap Android. The second tends to be a fancier Android. Finally, they upgrade to an iPhone.\n\u201cThe iPhone is your dream phone,\u201d he said."

        "fulltext": "It\u2019s hard to recall, but there was a time when the iPhone wasn\u2019t ubiquitous.\nA time when a smartphone might have set you backa couple hundred dollarswith a two-year contract, and BlackBerry was king. (\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d one of the company\u2019s chief executives reportedly said when the first iPhone was unveiled.)\nHow things have changed.\nAmong the latest iPhones,debuting on Tuesday, will be a premium model with a price tagstarting at about $1,000. That\u2019s a big jump from the first model, which was about half that price when Appleintroduced it in January 2007. That year, a steady drumbeat of excitement turned into a frenzy. Soon it was being referred to as the \u201cJesus phone.\u201d\n(Read live analysis of Tuesday\u2019sApple iPhone event.)\nDavid Pogue\u2019s initial review of the device, published in The New York Times on June 27 that year,described it as \u201camazing\u201d but \"not perfect.\u201d\nMr. Pogue wasone of only four reviewerswho had been allowed to try out the iPhone before it went on sale.\nThat web browser?

You scroll with a fingertip \u2014 much faster than scroll bars.

The image grows as though it\u2019s on a sheet of latex.\nFor many, the iPhone wasn\u2019t just a device, it was an experience. The Times\u2019s Farhad Manjoorecently wroteabout his introduction to the product.\nIt wasn\u2019t the first smartphone, the first mobile computer, or the first anything, really.\nBut when I got my hands on the first iPhone in 2007, I knew it was unlike any machine I\u2019d ever used before, and it would forever alter my tech-addled life.

Even so, he continued, \u201csome of the criticisms are justified.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no memory-card slot, no chat program, no voice dialing,\u201d he wrote. \"The browser can\u2019t handle Java or Flash, which deprives you of millions of Web videos.\u201d\nOther inconveniences: no video, no way to send \u201cpicture messages (called MMS) to other cellphones\u201d and no third-party apps. (The App Store wasn\u2019t born until 2008.)\nThen there were typing woes. \u201cTapping the skinny little virtual keys on the screen is frustrating, especially at first,\u201d Mr. Pogue wrote.\nAnd what remains a constant bane for users: battery life.\n\u201cApple says that the battery starts to lose capacity after 300 or 400 charges,\u201d Mr. Pogue wrote. \u201cEventually, you\u2019ll have to send the phone to Apple for battery replacement, much as you do now with an iPod, for a fee.\u201d\nNo replaceable batteries? Times reporter Joe Nocera said at the time that this revelation \u201cstopped me in my tracks.\u201d He asked Apple how it planned to service its batteries, but hedidn\u2019t get a straightforward answer.\n\u201cIt is about assured obsolescence,\u201d Rob Enderle of the Enderle Group, a technology consulting firm, told Mr. Nocera in 2007.\nAs much as things have changed, some things really do stay the same."

        "title": "The iPhone 8: A Worthy Refinement Before the Next Generation",
        "fulltext": "What does one say about a new iPhone? At this point,a decade after the first onesent the earth spinning in directions both magical and ghastly, it can be difficult to summon any fresh wonder when appraising the familiar little slab of digital horror and delight.\nThe problem is especially acute for the two traditional iPhones hitting the market this year,the iPhone 8 and the larger 8 Plus, which are priced at $699 and up and will begin shipping this Friday.\nThe 8s look almost identical to the iPhones 7, 6S and 6, a model introduced back when Donald Trump was still hosting a reality TV show. To make matters worse, both are overshadowed by the $1,000all-screen iPhone X, which Apple considers the foundation for the next iteration of the iPhone. That model ships in November, and reviewers have not yet had a chance to use it.\nSo here\u2019s my conclusion, after nearly a week testing the 8 and 8 Plus: The 8s feel like a swan song \u2014 or, to put it another way, they represent Apple\u2019s platonic ideal of that first iPhone, an ultimate refinement before eternal retirement.\nUnsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones. Most of Apple\u2019s improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade. And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, there\u2019s one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition \u2014 the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.\nBut let\u2019s start with the basics.\n\u2022 The iPhone\u2019s overall design is very slightly improved in the 8. The new models have a glass back, which you would think would make them more delicate but which actually adds a slight grippiness, making them less prone to catastrophe. (I\u2019d still use a case for the 8 Plus, which I find ungainly to hold; the 8, though, shines in its caseless glory.)\nThe glass back allows for the iPhone 8\u2019s handiest new feature, wireless charging. This works just as it does on the many other phones that have long sported this trick: Set the phone down on a charging pad and it just starts charging, even through most cases. Apple said it would release its own charging mat next year; for now, you can use one of the many third-party mats that run the Qi wireless standard. (Over all, battery life on the 8 was comparable to that of the 7 \u2014 it lasted all day with light use, about half a day with heavy use, and always not long enough.)\n\u2022 The display on the 8 and 8 Plus is better than on the 7, but only very slightly. In particular, the screen uses a technology Apple calls True Tone, which automatically adjusts the display\u2019s white balance to match the lighting in your surroundings. This adds a subtle vibrancy to everything you see \u2014 though honestly the only time I was able to appreciate it was when I compared it side by side with the iPhone 7.\nIn other ways, the display is where the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus fall furthest short of their rivals. The 8s use a technology called LCD, while Apple\u2019s rivals in the high-end phone market, including Samsung, usea newer screen technology called OLED. I won\u2019t get into the differences here except to say OLEDs are noticeably superior \u2014 they produce more vibrant colors and deeper contrast ratios. Even Apple seems to agree, given that OLED is the basis for the display in the iPhone X.\n\u2022 The cameras in the 8s are very good, which is alwaystrue of camerasin the iPhone. My kid had a birthday party this weekend, and just before leaving for the venue, I decided to take a risk \u2014 I left my fancy interchangeable-lens \u201cmirrorless\u201d camera at home, and instead took just the 8 Plus.\nIt would be too much to say that the phone produced images comparable to those I could get on my dedicated camera. In some indoor, low-light shots, Apple\u2019s noise-reduction algorithm left an annoying watercolorlike ripple on my shots (a problem that hasplagued previous iPhones, too).\nBut that was the exception. Most images were astounding, and given the iPhone 8\u2019s advantages in size, convenience and usability, I predict that my camera will be spending a lot more time in the drawer. In particular, I fell hard for the 8 Plus\u2019s \u201cPortrait Lighting\u201d feature, which uses data from a depth sensor to mimic the blurred-background \u201cbokeh\u201d effect you get when taking portraits with expensive cameras. That feature made its debut last year on the iPhone 7 Plus, but in the 8 Plus, it\u2019s been further refined to let you adjust the lighting of each shot, making for breathtaking portraits that you\u2019ll be surprised came from a mere phone.\n\u2022 But the best thing about the 8 and 8 Plus is what\u2019s most hidden: It\u2019s the processor that powers everything else. The first thing I usually do when I get a new iPhone is run a benchmark app to get a sense of the kind of power I\u2019m dealing with. (Yeah, I\u2019m real fun.)\nFor the last few years, Apple\u2019s phones have been producing benchmark scores so high you wonder if they\u2019re powered by some kind of black magic. For instance, on Geekbench 4, one of the more popular benchmark apps, the iPhone 8 gets a single-core processor score ofaround 4,200. That makes it about 25 percent faster than the iPhone 7 and about 80 percent faster than the iPhone 6S.\nThefastest Android phones, though, are painfully behind. With a Geekbench score of around 1,900, Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S8 is not just half the speed of the iPhone 8, but it\u2019s actually slower than last year\u2019s iPhone 7, and even slower than the iPhone 6S, released in 2015. In fact, Apple\u2019s phones are now so powerful that the closest rivals aren\u2019t phones but computers \u2014 for instance, the processor in the iPhone gets benchmarking scores comparable to the Intel chips found insome of Apple\u2019s latest MacBook Pro laptops.\nI spoke to several processor analysts about why Apple is so far ahead on processing power. They explained that Apple can produce these gains because it designs its own processors, while its competitors rely on chips created by third parties. And performance matters. Everything you do on a phone is improved by better chips: The interface is more responsive, advanced graphical features like augmented reality (in which digital scenes are interposed on the real world) work more fluidly, and they allow for groundbreaking new features, like the face-detection system Apple built into the iPhone X.\nAnd while experts said Apple\u2019s lead might slip over time, for now, its advantage remains enormous enough to make the iPhone a must for people who think of their phones as their most important computing device \u2014 in other words, you and me and everyone we know."

        "fulltext": "Reviews ofthe newest iPhones, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, landed across the internet on Tuesday, with most major reviewers agreeing that they represent a modest improvement over the previous generation but remain overshadowed by the looming iPhone X.\nTechnology reviewers were able to test out the iPhone 8, which will begin shipping Friday, but have not yet spent much time with the iPhone X, which won\u2019t be available until November but packs a significantly changed design and more features. Most reviewers were hesitant to offer a full-throated endorsement of the phones, except for those who know theywon\u2019t be spending $1,000 for the iPhone X(pronounced ten).\nFarhad ManjooofThe New York Timessaid the phones \u201crepresent Apple\u2019s platonic ideal of that first iPhone, an ultimate refinement before eternal retirement.\u201d\nUnsurprisingly, both the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are very good phones. Most of Apple\u2019s improvements over the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are minor, but if you have an older model, either of the 8s will feel like a solid upgrade. And if you are considering upgrading from an Android phone, there\u2019s one area where the new iPhones still rank head and shoulders above their competition \u2014 the processor, the engine that runs the entire device, where Apple is so far ahead that it almost feels unfair.\nAtTime,Lisa Eadiciccowrote that the improvements meant anyone who doesn\u2019t want to invest in the high-end X model will now have several options, and not everyone will need to spend the money to upgrade at all.\nThe iPhone 8 and 8 Plus may not be as flashy as the iPhone X, but anyone upgrading from an older model will appreciate the jumps. Coming from the iPhone 6s, for instance, you\u2019re getting double the storage, the option to wirelessly charge your iPhone, a refreshed design, and a faster camera. If you\u2019re coming from the iPhone 7 family, on the other hand, it\u2019s harder to make the case.\nSeveral reviewers said the phones were stuck in the shadow of the iPhone X.Nilay PatelofThe Vergesaid the phones were \u201cnot the future, and it\u2019s not the cutting edge. It\u2019s just the default.\u201d\nWhile the 8 and 8 Plus share a processor, wireless charging capability, and similar camera setups to the X, they lack any truly new ideas about what an iPhone is \u2014 they\u2019re both very much just the next step along a path Apple\u2019s been on for quite some time now.\nSo what\u2019s actually new? The most commonly cited improvements included the camera, wireless charging and augmented reality abilities.\nNicole NguyenofBuzzFeed Newswrote that the new iPhones had better cameras than the 7 and 7 Plus, but that the differences in images could be hard to spot.\nThe new \u201ccolor filter\u201d and \u201cdeeper pixels\u201d in the 8 and 8 Plus mean more vivid colors and less noise. The new image signal processor helps optimize features like exposure, autofocus, and HDR, before you take the photo.\nWhat that means in practice is more detailed photos that really only appear more detailed if you zoom way, way in.\nDavid PogueofYahoo Financesaid the wireless charging would be a feature iPhone owners would quickly grow to appreciate.\nOnce you\u2019ve tried pad charging, you won\u2019t go back. You come home from work, you just set the phone down on your way in. Or you set it down on your bedside table. Done.\nAtCNN,Heather Kellywas impressed by the augmented reality potential.\nAfter testing early augmented reality apps, it\u2019s clear the feature is well executed and packs a genuine \u201cwow\u201d factor. It\u2019s most useful for games, shopping and a star gazing app that overlays constellations on the real night sky. It also offers the most enjoyable way to dissect a beating human heart in my kitchen yet.\nAs for battery life,Hayley TsukayamaofThe Washington Postwrote that the phones would be sufficient for a typical day of use.\nThe iPhone 8 Plus definitely has better battery life than its smaller sibling, even when being used heavily. On a day where I had to use it for navigation, video streaming and plenty of email, it made it through the day and probably could have made it through the next morning without being in dire need of a top-up. The iPhone 8, when I used it, got down pretty low by the end of the day, at which point I switched to low power mode. In other words, it got me through a day, but not much further.\nThe processing power impressed reviewers, but some, includingGeoffrey A. Fowlerof TheWall Street Journal, questioned how much you would actually benefit from the technological feat.\nWhat can you do with a phone that fast? Those new camera tricks, plus high frame-rate 4K video, wouldn\u2019t be possible without it. And it never hurts to try to futureproof the computer you use most. But the bottleneck on the apps I use most often is internet speed, not the processor. Aside from some 3-D games, I couldn\u2019t find many apps that require so much horsepower today.\nSome reviewers criticized the design, which is largely unchanged in major ways from previous years. The biggest change was an all-glass back, whichMatthew PanzarinoofTechCrunchsaid was a \u201clove-it-or-hate-it\u201d feature that he loved.\nThere\u2019s something about the texture of glass. It\u2019s smoother than the aluminum, but typically less slippery and easier to grip. Glass also warms up to the temperature of your hand faster and stays at that temperature rather than getting hot. And when your phone is really chugging along, it distributes the heat from the processor better, making hot spots less pronounced.\nChris VelazcoatEngadgetcalled the new models \u201cfamiliar-looking phones that mostly operate the way people expect them to.\u201d\nApple has painted us a picture of what its mobile future looks like, so is it any surprise the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus seem dull by comparison? To be clear, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re poorly designed. It\u2019s just that the iPhone\u2019s aesthetic hasn\u2019t changed much since the debut of the 6 and 6 Plus three years ago.\nDoes it all add up to a device worth buying? Some, likeSteve KovachatBusiness Insider, felt the looming presence of the iPhone X made that less than certain.\nFor the first time in the 10-year history of the iPhone, I can\u2019t recommend buying the newest models.\nThat\u2019s not because the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are bad phones. They\u2019re actually great.\nBut an even better phone is on the way."

I returned the first iPhone three weeks after buying it.\nIts camera wasn\u2019t great. It didn\u2019t have the App Store. It worked on just one carrier. It cost $599. It was slow \u2014 very, very slow.\nStill, in those long moments it took to load a web page, you could see the whole future laid out before you: If they could get this right, if they could turn this into a general-purpose everywhere computer, it could change everything.\nThe speed of the internet was vastly improved in the second one. The connected-everywhere promise was becoming something of a reality.\nAnd, despite Steve Jobs\u2019 early objections, Apple created its App Store.\nSuddenly, the iPhone wasn\u2019t just a shiny bauble. It was useful. It could mimicjust about any other gadget you had, from your Game Boy to your flashlight.\nAnd apps could do things no other gadgets could do. Before the App Store, a song could come on the radio and you\u2019d have no way of figuring out what it was. Now you Shazam\u2019d it.\nToday, a lot of what you use on the iPhone is made by other people.\nThese phones also knew where you were in the world, thanks to GPS. You could use maps in real time to get around. But GPS would eventually lead to so much more: Uber, Tinder, a scrapbook of photos on a map.\nThe price was also right.\nAT&T, the only carrier offering it at the time, sold the new phone with a subsidy.\n$199. Almost too good to pass up if you could afford it.\nIt created a dynamic that would turn the iPhone into the world\u2019s most profitable product \u2014 a luxury device at a mainstream price.\nPeople had been snapping self-portraits with cheap cellphones for years. But the pictures didn\u2019t look great. Self-snapping was seen as tacky, uncouth,a thing for MySpace.\nThe iPhone 4 changed that. The first iPhone with a camera on its front, it let you take good-looking pictures of yourself.\nThe phenomenon became agonizing to parents, and irresistible to everyone else.\nSnapchat was released a year later, in 2011. So was iCloud, Apple\u2019s backup storage service.\nThe collection of these technologies \u2014 selfie cameras, photo chatting, hackable online backups \u2014 would rock people\u2019s lives.\nDozens of celebrities\u2019intimate iCloud photos were hackedin 2014. \u201cRevenge porn\u201d became a thing.\nAnd remember Anthony Weiner?\nShe didn\u2019t sound like Rosie from \u201cThe Jetsons.\u201d She was personable, and even tried to make jokes.\nShe was Siri, the first robotic assistant that most of us encountered.\nBut she quickly disappointed. She didn\u2019t seem very smart. She wasn\u2019t very useful. She was slow and unreliable. She misheard you.\nIn time, she was eclipsed. Now there\u2019s Alexa and Google Now. Siri has felt stuck in the past.\nThe iPhone 5 carried a bigger screen stuffed into a brushed aluminum enclosure. There was often no purer joy than simply holding it in your hand.\nDesign-wise, the iPhone has gone downhill ever since.\nBut the iPhone 5 wasn\u2019t just about design. It\u2019s when the iPhone grew up.\nThe cameras were simply dazzling, so good you didn\u2019t need to carry anything else. The iPhone had consumed another gadget, the point-and-shoot. (This was around the time thatKodak declared bankruptcy.)\nAnd the iPhone got fast. Really fast. Carriers began handling more and more data. Everyone underestimated how all this would change the world.\nThen we started to see it: Our social media feeds, which have become the main way we encountered news, filled up with photos, videos and live broadcasts snapped on phones.\nThe whole world came to you through a window in your hands. It was unsettling and unavoidable. It was distracting, too. The iPhone \u2014 and its numerous competitors \u2014 were so irresistible that people wouldrisk death to text.\nThere were theoriesthat they sapped our attention, that they were creating a new generation ofantisocial and unstable young people. (Some of these worries were overblown, as they always are with new technologies.)\nBy the end of 2013, Apple had sold nearly 500 million iPhones. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said at the time that people were sending two billion messages a day on iPhones and other devices running its mobile operating system.\nA few years earlier, Samsung created a laughably huge phone, the Galaxy Note. It turned out to be a huge seller.\nApple\u2019s dominance now appeared to be threatened. People started to sayit couldn\u2019t innovate.\nSo Apple did something radical, and obvious: It made bigger phones. They sold sold amazingly well, and Apple\u2019s stock shot up.\nBut its decision to copy its rivals on size felt like a new turn in its history. It marked a stepping back from the vanguard.\nApple\u2019s phones are still the best you can buy. They still pack some of the most innovative features on the market. But they\u2019re not all that much better. Which phone you buy now feels like a matter of personal taste, rather than a judgment on product quality alone.\nFor the iPhone to continue to be the iPhone, the trend-setting device of a generation, Apple has to do something big.\nThis week, Apple tried to do just that: It unveiled what it calls \u201cthe future of the smartphone,\u201d theiPhone X(pronounced \u201cten,\u201d because, well, it\u2019s Apple).\nIt does away with the Home button, it unlocks with facial recognition and it can animate your facial gestures onto piles of poo.\nBut is it the next big thing? Check back in a decade.\nAdvertisement"
