        "title": "Apple Watch Success Will Hinge on Apps",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 The value of a wristwatch is typically defined by its materials, design, features and brand. For the newAppleWatch, all those factors will apply, but so will something else: apps.\nApple on Monday held a media event to explain how its long-awaited Apple Watch works and how much it costs. Just as important, it also demonstrated what the watch was capable of doing with apps made by other companies.\nIf the watch is going to succeed, those other companies will have a lot to do with it because few devices \u2014 not even those made by Apple \u2014 will sell well without the help of a whole lot of app developers.\n\u201cAll of Apple\u2019s devices really come alive with third-party apps, and it\u2019ll be the same with the watch,\u201d said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst for Jackdaw Research.\nWhen Apple released theiPhonein 2007, it was essentially a blank slate. When the App Store opened a year later, the device became much more than a fancy phone.\nJust by downloading an app, the iPhone could become a musical instrument, a medical device, a TV remote and gaming device. It became the ultimate Swiss army knife of gadgets.\nFor the Apple Watch to be remotely as successful, Apple will have to find a way to take that world of apps to the wrist. But a watch presents unique challenges with its tiny screen. And the way app developers make money from it will be different than with other Apple products.\nUnlike the iPhone oriPad, the Apple Watch is not a stand-alone product. It relies on an iPhone to fully operate, partly because the brains of watch apps will live on the iPhone. So users will have to install watch apps on the iPhone as well.\nThe economics of that combination are tricky. Developers working on watch apps have to make an iPhone app first and expand it to include support for the watch. And it remains unclear whether they can double-dip. Apple has not said whether developers can charge for the iPhone app, then charge again for the watch extension.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced features of the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s foray into wearable devices.\nTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, introduced features of the Apple Watch, the company\u2019s foray into wearable devices.\nKevin Lynch, an Apple executive, demonstrated how Instagram functions on Apple Watch.\nMr. Cook explained the evolution of Apple devices, and how the new smart watch fit into the company\u2019s computing offerings.\nMr. Cook showed off the new MacBook.\nMr. Cook described the new Apple store in China. He stated the company\u2019s ambitions to multiply the number of stores it has there by next year.\nJeff Williams, senior vice president for operations, described health research apps for the iPhone.\nStill, companies are trying, even though some are worried the watch\u2019s tiny screen can limit features or \u2014 even worse \u2014 ads.\nChristian Gaiser, chief executive of Retale, said his company found a path to using a watch app to complement its smartphone app. Retale\u2019s iPhone app displays weekly deals for retailers like Walmart and Target.\nRetale users who see something they want to buy in the iPhone app can push the nearest location of the retailer to the watch app, which will map out turn-by-turn directions on the watch screen. Retale collects fees from retailers whenever customers engage with their ads, so the watch app is meant to increase usage of the smartphone app, Mr. Gaiser said.\nAt its event, Apple also demonstrated an app from Uber, the ride-sharing service, to summon a car. The watch app shows where the driver is on a map, and from there, the user can place a phone call to the driver.\nApple also showed an app developed by Starwood Hotels. Starwood\u2019s iPhone app can be used to book a hotel room. The watch app sends a notification to the watch wearer when he or she is near the hotel. When the guest arrives at the hotel, the watch app shows the room number, and after that the watch can unlock the user\u2019s room door just with a hand wave over the lock.\n\u201cThe end goal is to build loyalty with our most valuable guests,\u201d said Chris Holdren, who led development of the Starwood watch app. \u201cIt continues to deepen the relationship we have with them.\u201d\nUnlike past Apple products, the Apple Watch has a complex pricing structure. Because a smartwatch is both device and fashion accessory, Apple designed the watch to be highly customizable to suit the tastes of various users, from fitness buffs to collectors of luxury watches.\nApple will offer three models, each with a casing made of a different material: Watch Sport, a version with an aluminum case; Watch, which has a stainless steel case; and Watch Edition, which has a case made of 18-karat gold.\nEach model comes in two case sizes \u2014 1.5 inches and 1.65 inches. And for each watch, customers will be able to choose from a variety of interchangeable bands in different colors and materials.\nThe cheapest model is the Apple Watch Sport, the one tailored to athletes, which starts at $350. The larger Apple Watch Sport costs $400.\nThe next step up is the Apple Watch, with a more fashionable stainless steel case. The smaller version of this watch costs $550 to $1,040, and the larger one costs $600 to $1,100. The price range for both depends on the band.\nThe golden Apple Watch Edition is a sure sign that Apple has entered the luxury market. Pricing for this high-end version starts at $10,000.\nPreorders start April 10, and the watches will go on sale on April 24. They will first be available in a select number of countries, including the United States, Australia, China and Japan.\nAt the event, Apple also stressed some of the signature features of the device.\nThe company has highlighted the crown as its latest signature innovation for controlling a device, similar to the mouse for the personal computer, the click wheel on the iPod and the touch screen for the iPhone. On the Apple Watch, the crown can be twisted to zoom in or out of the screen or to scroll through a web page.\nYou can take and even make phone calls, as long as your iPhone is nearby.\n\u201cI have been wanting to do this since I was 5 years old,\u201d said Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive.\nThe watch includes a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement to complement fitness applications. It has a chip that helps it make wireless payments.\nThe watch also includes Digital Touch, an application that enables a new method of communication between watch users. Watch wearers can scribble sketches on the watch screen and send them to one another, or even send their heartbeats.\nApple also added to the watch a so-called taptic engine, which taps users on the wrist with a tactile sensation when they receive alerts, messages or notifications. Apple said the watch\u2019s battery would last 18 hours.\nApple also announced a new MacBook laptop with a 12-inch high-resolution \u201cretina\u201d display. It weighs two pounds and measures 13.1 millimeters at its thickest point. It also includes a new port called USB-C. It is a versatile port that can be used for charging, plugging in a video monitor, or hooking up a USB accessory like a keyboard.\nThe MacBook\u2019s starting price is $1,300 and it begins shipping April 10.\nApple on Monday also released upgrades for some of its other notebooks, including the MacBook Air."

        "fulltext": "Apple\u2019s entryinto the Dow Jones industrial average is a bit like polishing an antique. The average share price of 30 stocks selected by committee will finally include the world\u2019s biggest company in place of AT&T. It\u2019s an overdue move for an outdated yardstick \u2014 one that, like landlines and checkbooks, lives on.\nThe fact that Apple will replace its original iPhone telecom partner in the Dow is a reminder of the march of time, technology and, specifically, smartphones. The change will help the Dow catch up somewhat with the importance of information technology to the broader economy. But it\u2019s a hint of the average\u2019s antiquated construction that this was prompted by a stock split planned by Visa \u2014 a move with no real-world significance.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average dates from a simpler, computer-free era when working out the average of 30 stock prices counted as financial added value. Now, it seems bizarre that anyone pays attention to a metric in which companies that have higher stock prices \u2014 but not necessarily higher market values \u2014 matter more.\nThe index smells a bit musty in other ways as well, including the small number of companies and the rather arbitrary nature of its selections. Apple\u2019s growth has been the biggest story in the American market over the last decade, and the Dow has missed it. A Reuters analysis shows that inserting Apple in place of any of the 30 stocks except Visa would have made the index perform better since last June, when the iPhone maker split its stock and brought its price into a range that the Dow\u2019s committee deemed acceptable.\nThe market value-weighted Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index and other similar but broader benchmarks are the more scientific choices \u2014 $1.9 trillion of passive investments track the S.&P. index, according to McGraw Hill. Yet the 128-year-old Dow remains more familiar on America\u2019s Main Street. Apple\u2019s arrival within it will help keep the relic going."

        "title": "Apple Opens Up to Praise New Book on Steve Jobs, and Criticize an Old One",
        "fulltext": "Steve Jobsprized secrecy from his executives and employees during his tenure atApple. Now his top lieutenants are speaking out \u2014 to help shape the legacy of Steve Jobs.\nThrough interviews and tweets, Apple brass, including the chief executive,Timothy D. Cook, are throwing their weight behind a new unauthorized biography of the Apple co-founder, \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d which goes on sale on Tuesday. In the book, executives take aim at another title, \u201cSteve Jobs\u201d by Walter Isaacson, an authorized biography published shortly after Mr. Jobs\u2019s death in 2011.\nMr. Isaacson\u2019s best seller did a \u201ctremendous disservice\u201d to the Apple chief, Mr. Cook said in the new book, written by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, and excerpted in the April issue of Fast Company. \u201cIt didn\u2019t capture the person,\u201d Mr. Cook said. \u201cThe person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time.\u201d\nJony Ive, Apple\u2019s longtime design chief, added his criticism of Mr. Isaacson\u2019s biography last month in aNew Yorker profile. \u201cMy regard couldn\u2019t be any lower\u201d for the book, he said, noting that he had read only parts of it.\nEddy Cue, Apple\u2019s chief of software and Internet services, endorsed the new book on Mr. Jobs onTwitterlast week: \u201cBest portrayal is about to be released \u2014 Becoming Steve Jobs (book). Well done and first to get it right.\u201d Apple\u2019s iBooks account alsotweetedlast week that \u201c \u2018Becoming Steve Jobs\u2019 is the only book about Steve recommended by the people who knew him best.\u201d\nThe book-on-book criticism is a rare public cavalcade from Apple executives, who under Mr. Jobs kept quiet about the company\u2019s activities. It shows the lengths that Apple is going in its effort to reshape the posthumous image of Mr. Jobs as a kinder spirit, rather than a one-dimensional mercurial and brash chief. To that end, Apple gave the authors of \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d interviews with four executives, including Mr. Cook. In another sign of the company\u2019s implicit approval of the biography, the writers will discuss the book and field questions about it on Thursday at the Apple store in SoHo.\nApple\u2019s cooperation wasn\u2019t easily won, Mr. Schlender and Mr. Tetzeli said in an email interview. When the veteran tech journalists first approached the company about the book in 2012, both were told executives would not give any interviews. Apple changed its mind 18 months later, they said.\n\u201cI think our patience and quiet perseverance was what eventually won them over,\u201d said Mr. Schlender, who covered Mr. Jobs for almost 25 years. He said he wanted to write the book because he felt there was a side of Mr. Jobs\u2019s personality that had never been captured by journalists. While the authors fact-checked portions of the book with Apple and other sources and showed the finished volume to the company, Apple wasn\u2019t allowed to have \u201cany editorial input whatsoever,\u201d Mr. Tetzeli said.\n\u201cAfter a long period of reflection following Steve\u2019s death, we felt a sense of responsibility to say more about the Steve we knew,\u201d Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, said. \u201cWe decided to participate in Brent and Rick\u2019s book because of Brent\u2019s long relationship with Steve, which gave him a unique perspective on Steve\u2019s life. The book captures Steve better than anything else we\u2019ve seen, and we are happy we decided to participate.\u201d\nA handful of influential tech bloggers received early copies of the book, including John Gruber, who wrote on his websiteDaring Fireballthat the book was \u201csmart, accurate, informative, insightful and at times, utterly heartbreaking.\u201d\nPhilip Elmer-DeWitt, a Fortune writer, said in ablog postthat Mr. Schlender\u2019s long relationship with Mr. Jobs helped distinguish the new book from past titles about the Apple chief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s through Schlender\u2019s stories, freshly told, often from taped interviews, that we get to know Steve Jobs as Schlender knew him,\u201d Mr. Elmer-DeWitt wrote.\nIn an interview, Mr. Isaacson, chief executive of the Aspen Institute and a former managing editor of Time, said he had tried to take a balanced view of Mr. Jobs that did not sugarcoat the Apple co-founder\u2019s flaws. He interviewed Mr. Jobs more than 40 times and spoke to more than 100 of his friends, relatives, rivals and colleagues, including Mr. Cook, Mr. Ive and Mr. Cue.\nIn the introduction to \u201cSteve Jobs,\u201d Mr. Isaacson wrote that Mr. Jobs, who had handpicked him as biographer, didn\u2019t try to exert any control over the book, except for weighing in on the cover. The biography proved enormously popular, selling more than three million copies in the United States alone.\n\u201cMy book is very favorable and honest, with no anonymous slings,\u201d Mr. Isaacson said, adding that he was criticized at times for being too soft on his subject.\nMr. Isaacson said he was pleased to see more biographies and movies \u2014 a documentary on Mr. Jobs recently debuted at the South by Southwest festival, anda biopic featuringthe actor Michael Fassbender as Mr. Jobs was also in the works \u2014 that would help the public\u2019s understanding of Apple\u2019s former leader. \u201cIt\u2019s really cool that there are other books coming out by people who knew Steve and where those who really loved him can put forth their views, because that\u2019s how history is made,\u201d he said.\nApple\u2019s active participation in \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d is also another sign of how Mr. Cook has shaped the company into one that is more open and vocal. Over the last six months, Apple executives have been on an extensive media campaign to promote new retail stores, the Apple Watch and Apple Pay, a new mobile payment service.\nMr. Cook has not been shy about defending Apple\u2019s image, either. When the author Yukari I. Kane published \u201cHaunted Empire: Apple After Steve Jobs\u201d last year, Mr. Cook publicly dismissed the book as \u201cnonsense.\u201d Ms. Kane said the colorful remarks from Apple executives about Mr. Isaacson\u2019s book reflect a looser discipline at the company.\n\u201cJobs was a mastermind at controlling the narrative on Apple, and one of the ways he did that was to make sure that he was the sole spokesperson and that officially, at least, the company stayed above all the fracas,\u201d Ms. Kane said. She added that Mr. Cook\u2019s critical comment ended up being used for the cover of her book by overseas publishers.\n\u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d paints him as a caring mentor, as well as a delegator and skillful manager who brought the best out of his team. In the Fast Companyexcerpt, Mr. Cook told a story of what happened after he learned that Mr. Jobs needed a liver transplant in 2009. When Mr. Cook discovered that he and Mr. Jobs shared the same rare blood type, Mr. Cook offered a part of his liver to his ailing friend.\n\u201cI really wanted him to do it,\u201d he said in the book. \u201cHe cut me off at the legs, almost before the words were out of my mouth. \u2018No,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ll never let you do that. I\u2019ll never do that!\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cSomebody that\u2019s selfish,\u201d Mr. Cook continued, \u201cdoesn\u2019t reply like that.\u201d\nLater in the excerpt, Mr. Cue of Apple noted that in Mr. Jobs\u2019s final years, the Apple chief did everything he could to have people treat him as if he were not sick. \u201cYou could see it in the meetings; he was taking morphine, and you could see he was in pain, but he was still interested,\u201d Mr. Cue said.\nMr. Cue has become a vocal defender of Mr. Jobs\u2019s legacy, too, and he took to Twitter recently to criticize the filmmaker Alex Gibney\u2019s new documentary about the former Apple chief as \u201can inaccurate and mean-spirited view of my friend. It\u2019s not a reflection of the Steve I knew.\u201d Minutes later, Mr. Cue praised \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs.\u201d\nOf course, endorsements from corporate executives hardly ensure that the book will be popular. \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs\u201d is the latest entry to a crowded subgenre of breathless technology books aiming to unravel the mysteries of the late pioneer, works that include \u201cInside Steve\u2019s Brain,\u201d \u201cThe 66 Secrets of Steve Jobs,\u201d \u201cThe Innovation Secrets of Steve Jobs,\u201d and, for would-be Keynote rock stars, \u201cThe Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs.\u201d\nThe publisher of \u201cBecoming Steve Jobs,\u201d the Crown Publishing Group, is promoting the book as the first account to get the story right, calling it \u201cthe definitive history.\u201d Crown has increased the print run to 85,000 copies from a planned first printing of 40,000.\nRoger Scholl, the vice president and executive editor of Crown Publishing, said the market for Steve Jobs books was not close to saturated. \u201cHe led such a rich and full life, there\u2019s more to be done on him,\u201d he said."

The economy recently has shown small signs of picking up.\nNonetheless, the jobless rate in the 19-nation currency zone is expected to be 11.4 percent, unchanged from December. Consumer prices are expected to fall 0.5 percent, for a second month in negative territory. While the large decline in oil prices has pushed prices lower, \u201ccore\u201d inflation \u2014 excluding energy and food costs \u2014 remains near zero, far below the central bank\u2019s target of slightly less than 2 percent.\u2014David Jolly\n[ Update:Consumer prices in the eurozone fell 0.3 percent in Februaryfrom a year earlier, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, reported on Monday from Luxembourg. Prices had fallen 0.6 percent in January and 0.2 percent in December. ]\n\u2022 Personal Income and Spending\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the Commerce Department, will report Monday on personal income and spending in January. Economists say they expect spending to have declined slightly primarily because the value of gasoline bought by consumers dropped as gas prices plunged, reducing the amount of spending over all. Auto sales may also have cooled in January, after a blockbuster 2014.\nPersonal income is thought to have risen, because of factors including the annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients, which take effect in January. The combination of rising income, slower spending and savings on gas being put into the bank could increase the savings rate to just less than 6 percent, a two-year high.\u2014Nelson Schwartz\n[ Update:Consumer spending in the United States fell for a second straight monthin January. The Commerce Department said on Monday consumer spending slipped 0.2 percent after falling 0.3 percent in December. ]\n\u2022 Hearing in Guardrail Case\nThe final hearing in Trinity Industries\u2019 guardrail fraud case in Texas will be Tuesday, before Judge Rodney Gilstrap of United States District Court imposes penalties on the company. The highway guardrail maker was found liable by a federal jury in October of defrauding the government by not disclosing changes to its ET-Plus guardrail system.\nThe jury in the whistle-blower case awarded $175 million, which under federal law will be tripled to $525 million. Judge Gilstrap may impose additional fines, potentially adding millions to the judgment, as well as lawyers\u2019 fees.\nTrinity\u2019s guardrail product is accused of malfunctioning in crashes and slicing through cars, injuring or killing those inside. The company denies its product is defective. Over 40 states have banned further use of the ET-Plus pending the results of a federal investigation.\u2014Aaron M. Kessler\n\u2022 Retailers to Post Earnings\nA second wave of retailers will report fourth-quarter earnings this week, including Abercrombie & Fitch, the struggling apparel chain. Best Buy will also report on its holiday quarter and give more guidance for what could be a tough year for consumer electronics amid a decline in tablet sales and fewer big smartphone releases.\nFigures from Costco, the membership-only warehouse retail chain, will show how much it has been building on its dominance to attract new members and increase store traffic. And Staples, which recently announced a merger with Office Depot, will report on a quarter that is likely to show continued pressure from dwindling demand for office-supply items.\nBest Buy reports on Tuesday, Abercrombie & Fitch on Wednesday, Costco on Thursday and Staples on Friday.\u2014Hiroko Tabuchi\n\u2022 February Auto Sales\nCarmakers will report February sales on Tuesday, and analysts predict the numbers will be quite favorable. Auto sales were robust in 2014, though last year\u2019s brutal winter kept many people away from dealerships.\nAs a result, this year\u2019s January, February and even March sales will have somewhat larger percentage increases than would otherwise be the case. Kelley Blue Book, the auto research company, predicts new vehicle sales in February could reach nearly 1.3 million, up 8 percent from the previous year. It would be the 12th straight month of sales growth.\u2014Aaron M. Kessler\n\u2022 Standard Chartered Report\nStandard Chartered will report annual results on Wednesday, less than a week after announcing a leadership shake-up. The bank, which is based in London, but generates the majority of its profit in Asia, announced last week that its longtime chief executive, Peter Sands, will be succeeded this year by William T. Winters, the former head of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s investment bank.\nThe lender also announced the impending departures of its chairman, the head of its Asian business and several directors. Separately, Barclays is expected to report its annual results on Tuesday.\u2014Chad Bray\n\u2022 Apple\u2019s Appeal in Samsung Suit\nIn recent years, Samsung Electronics quickly rose to the top of the smartphone market, but not without stealing ideas from the iPhone, according to Apple\u2019s lawyers. Apple failed last year to persuade a federal judge to order a permanent ban on sales of some Samsung phones that infringed Apple\u2019s patents.\nOn Wednesday, Apple will present its argument to an appeals court in the hope of overturning the judge\u2019s rejection.\u2014Brian X. Chen\n\u2022 Bank Stress Test Results\nThe nation\u2019s largest banks on Thursday will receive the results of annual tests that aim to assess if they can weather severe financial storms. The Federal Reserve, which administers the so-called stress tests, will announce the results for 31 banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, at 4:30 p.m. on its website.\nThe tests help the Fed decide whether to approve the banks\u2019 plans for distributing money to their shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend payments. The banks, however, must wait until March 11 for the Fed\u2019s approval. Last year, the Fed objected to the plans of five banks, including Citigroup.\u2014Peter Eavis\n\u2022 European Bank Meeting\nOn Thursday, the European Central Bank will hold its first monetary policy meeting since it decided in January to begin buying 60 billion euros a month in government bonds and other debt to try to arrest a decline in inflation to levels considered bad for growth.\nAt a news conference after the meeting Mario Draghi, the bank\u2019s president, is expected to give more details about how the complicated purchase operations will work.\u2014Jack Ewing\n\u2022 February Jobs Figures\nOn Friday morning, the Labor Department will release the latest employment data for February. After surging to the fastest pace since the late 1990s in late 2014, the rate of hiring is estimated to have dropped slightly in February, with employers increasing payrolls by 235,000. Still, that is a healthy level, and it should be enough to lower the jobless rate by 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points from January\u2019s 5.7 percent rate, according to economists on Wall Street.\nIf the pace of hiring is much stronger or the unemployment rate drops more sharply than expected, that will be major news for investors and Wall Street. They are trying to decide when the Federal Reserve will begin its long-expected effort to raise short-term interest rates. It is a tossup between June and September. A positive surprise might tip the scales toward June, or at least tempt traders who always try to guess the Fed\u2019s thinking to bet that way.\u2014Nelson Schwartz"

At the event, in San Francisco, members of the news media are expected to be able to try the new smartwatch for the first time. The watch is expected to arrive in stores in April.\u2014Brian X. Chen\n\u2022 Bond Buying in Europe\nThe European Central Bankbegins buying government bondson Monday, beginning its quantitative easing program \u2014 in effect printing money to stimulate the eurozone economy and avert the threat of deflation. The central bank intervention in bond markets is expected to prompt investors to sell government bonds and buy riskier assets. Analysts will be watching closely to see if the central bank has trouble finding enough assets for sale.\u2014Jack Ewing\n\u2022 Questions for HSBC Chief\nOn Monday, Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive of HSBC, will face another round of questioning about the activities of its Swiss private bank. Documents leaked to the news media a few weeks ago revealed bankers from HSBC Suisse helping prominent clients evade taxes from 2007 and earlier. Mr. Gulliver appeared before the British treasury select committee a few weeks ago for more than two hours, apologizing for the bank\u2019s past misdeeds and arguing that it was a changed place, including a significantly smaller private bank. Neither he nor Douglas Flint, HSBC\u2019s chairman, would take personal responsibility for the misconduct, so expect members of Parliament \u2014 this time from the Public Accounts Committee \u2014 to try to extract such statements.\u2014Jenny Anderson\n\u2022 Greece to Detail Reforms\nAnother standoff loomed between Greece and its European lenders before a meeting in Brussels on Monday afternoon of eurozone finance ministers. Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister,was expected to outline a series of reformsaimed at unblocking sorely needed aid money to his 18 counterparts at the regular monthly gathering of the Eurogroup. But Mr. Varoufakis was already coming under renewed pressure from countries like Germany and Finland to do more to push through far-reaching reforms, such as creating an efficient system of tax collection. The Greek reforms must also be evaluated by Greece\u2019s bailout monitors \u2014 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2014 making any decision on Monday to release funds for Athens highly unlikely.\u2014James Kanter\n\u2022 China to Unveil Data\nChina is to release a raft of economic data this week that is expected to show growth slowing further. Monthly inflation figures, expected on Tuesday, are likely to improve slightly from January\u2019s five-year low, thanks to seasonal spending related to February\u2019s weeklong Lunar New Year holiday. On Wednesday, China reports combined January-February figures for industrial production, retail sales and investment in fixed assets, all of which are forecast to reflect the economic slowdown. Also expected this week are February figures on money supply and new loans, with the date of release yet to be determined.\u2014Neil Gough\n\u2022 Bank Test Results\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday will announce the results of the second and final stage of its stress tests for 2015. The tests are administered each year to assess whether the nation\u2019s largest banks have the financial strength to withstand severe shocks. The first set of results, released on Thursday, showed that all banks were on a sufficiently strong financial footing after the tests, though some performed better than others. On Wednesday, the banks will find out whether the Fed, after surveying the test results, will approve their plans to pay out money to shareholders. Failure to obtain that approval can disappoint investors and dent the credibility of a bank\u2019s senior management.\u2014Peter Eavis\n\u2022 Draghi to Speak\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, will be the keynote speaker at the annual \u201cE.C.B. and Its Watchers\u201d conference in Frankfurt on Wednesday. The event brings together central bankers and top economists who follow monetary policy. The debate this year is likely to focus on whether the European Central Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy measures will revive eurozone growth.\u2014Jack Ewing\n\u2022 Retail Sales\nThe Commerce Department will report data Thursday morning on retail sales in February. Wall Street is expecting a 0.4 percent increase in retail sales for last month, following a 0.8 percent drop in January that was largely due to lower gasoline prices, which reduced the total sums spent by consumers. Gas prices rebounded in February, which didn\u2019t help shoppers, but the increased total sales at gas stations might lift the headline number. One weak spot may be automobile sales, which were probably held back by wintry weather in many parts of the country last month. Energy prices remain much lower compared with a year ago, and economists will be watching to see how that savings is spent, or whether it is saved or used to pay down debt.\u2014Nelson Schwartz"

Watch owners, he said, will be given a selection of about half a dozen reports written specially for the app. \u201cReaders can swipe through these stories and get a quick glance, if they only have a few seconds and want to get caught up,\u201d he said.\nMr. Phelps said readers would also be able to immediately continue reading on their iPhones the reports they saw first on the watch, or save them for later.\nThe Apple watch will be available at the end of April. Since the company announced it late last year \u2014 in aluminum, steel and gold, with prices ranging from $349 to $17,000 \u2014 many have pondered what role the device, which requires connection with an iPhone to work fully, will play in the lives of connected consumers.\nLike the first iPhone, some analysts have said, the watch is likely to be defined by those who develop apps for it."

        "title": "Outdated Encryption Keys Leave Phones Vulnerable to Hackers",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 A government policy that forbade the export of products with strong encryption in the 1990s has years later left users of devices like Android andApplephones vulnerable to hackers when they visit one-third of all websites, includingwhitehouse.govandnsa.gov.\nResearchers last month discovered millions of devices and websites were using an outdated encryption key to secure their communications. The weak key resulted from a Clinton administration mandate that software and hardware makers use weak cryptography in products exported outside the United States.\nOnce those restrictions were relaxed in the late 1990s, many technology makers abandoned the weak cryptography. But researchers said this week that the old keys were included in the code that is still being used in a variety of modern devices and websites.\nThe discovery of the old vulnerability comes as officials in the United States and Britain press the technology industry to create so-called back doors for law enforcement agencies into the new and hard-to-crack encryption used by its products. Those back doors, industry officials argue, can just as well be used by hackers to intercept communications and pose an unnecessary risk to customers.\n\u201cWhen computer scientists say you can\u2019t build a crypto back door without weak encryption for everyone, this is exactly what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d said J. Alex Halderman, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan.\nThe debate over encryption \u2014 touched off by Edward J. Snowden\u2019s disclosures of the nation\u2019s efforts to crack and circumvent such protections \u2014 has intensified over the last year as technology companies added stronger security that would lock out government agencies.\nThe National Security Agency and the F.B.I. have urged tech companies to keep a back door open through their security technology for law enforcement agencies. And David Cameron, the British prime minister, has threatened to outlaw encrypted apps like Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service.\nBut many tech companies have repeatedly said they have no intentions of changing what they\u2019re doing, asTimothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, signaled in a speech last month at Stanford.\n\u201cIf those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money \u2014 we risk our way of life,\u201d Mr. Cook told an audience of White House officials, executives and cybersecurity experts. \u201cFortunately, technology gives us the tools to avoid these risks, and it\u2019s my sincere hope that by using them and by working together, we will.\u201d\nThere is no indication that hackers have exploited the newly discovered flaw, and technology companies say they are working to fix the problem.\nApple said on Wednesday it would patch the vulnerability through software updates for its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Macintosh operating system, OS X, next week.Googlesaid it had developed a patch to protect Android connections to websites and provided the patch to Android manufacturers. BlackBerry and Amazon, whose products are also affected by the flaw, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nResearchers are updating a list of vulnerable websites and services on their website, Freakattack.com, and pushing site administrators, device manufacturers and users to upgrade their software. More than a third of the 14 million websites scanned by researchers at the University of Michiganare still vulnerable.\nSecurity researchers are calling the vulnerability Freak \u2014 short for factoring attack on RSA export keys \u2014 because it can be used to crack a 512-bit encryption key in seven hours, using Amazon\u2019s readily available cloud computer service, at a nominal cost of $100 per website. A 512-bit key was the strongest allowed for export at the time. Today, that is considered inadequate.\nAfter researchers from Microsoft and Inria, the French computer science lab, discovered the vulnerability last month, Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, warned the researchers that it could be more widespread or dangerous than they had thought.\nSoon after, the researchers discovered that roughly 36 percent of online servers were vulnerable. Mr. Green alerted the affected technology companies.\nMr. Green said the vulnerability demonstrated the risk inherent in weakening encryption in order to allow law enforcement agencies access to secured communications.\nThe flaw is the fourth major \u2014 and old \u2014 security issue to be discovered hidden in a variety of tech products. Critics say that part of the problem is that there are not enough people paid to test and monitor the security of widely used Internet systems. Also, the Internet consists of a lot of moving parts with different people responsible for software, servers, bugs and more \u2014 and they often do not communicate.\n\u201cNobody was kind of looking down to see how all these different issues fit together,\u201d Mr. Green said."

        "title": "At Geneva Auto Show, Worry About Silicon Valley",
        "fulltext": "GENEVA \u2014 Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of Daimler, began a meeting with reporters at theGeneva International Motor Showon Tuesday by half-jokingly asking them not to spend too much time talking about Apple.\nAnd at a news conference later, the first question for Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Renault-Nissan Alliance, was: What about Apple?\nThe scenes are an indication of how much Silicon Valley has set its sights on the car industry, and how companies like Apple and Google have intruded on what could reasonably have been expected to be one of the most cheerful industry gatherings in years.\nPassenger car sales in the European Unionhave risen for 17 consecutive months, a sign that the industry is emerging from a brutal slump, though sales remain far below the level of 2007.Cheaper gasolinehas made driving more attractive, and the decline ofthe euroagainst the dollar and other major currencies has made it easier for European manufacturers to compete in foreign markets.\nBut there is palpable nervousness among automakers that the car industry could be next in line for disruption by Silicon Valley.\nApple and Google, which had no visible presence at the Geneva auto show, are using their domination of smartphone operating systems totake over car dashboards, elbowing aside the carmakers\u2019 proprietary systems. Someday, they or other upstarts could try to build entire vehicles. Apple has reportedly assembled a team of about 200 people to develop technologies for an electric car.\nMr. Zetsche and other auto executives here were quick to point out the huge differences between making a smartphone and a car. Cars take seven years or more to develop and bring to market, compared with 18 months or so for a new smartphone. A vast amount of engineering expertise is required to design a car that is safe as well as pleasant to drive. Auto manufacturing also requires a tightly coordinated network of suppliers. Unlike in the smartphone business, fabrication cannot simply be outsourced to a factory in China \u2014 at least not yet.\nBut it is clear that the technologies used to propel cars are in flux, even if electric cars account so far for only a sliver of the auto market. Software is playing an increasing role in helping drivers navigate and avoid accidents. Within a few years, cars will most likely be able to drive themselves, at least in standard situations like driving on highways or in stop-and-go traffic.\nMr. Zetsche said he thought it was good that Silicon Valley was showing an interest in the car business.\n\u201cThe convergence of automobile technology with the tech world is a huge opportunity,\u201d he said during a meeting with a small group of reporters.\nSystems that take over much of the driving provide a new selling point and can improve safety.\n\u201cI see it as only positive,\u201d Mr. Zetsche said. But, he added, \u201cit\u2019s clear that new technologies can have a destructive quality.\u201d\nMr. Ghosn agreed, saying it was refreshing that tech companies were interested in electric cars, an area in which the French-Japanese Renault-Nissan has made major investments.\nThe risk for automakers is that these technology shifts will provide openings for new competitors to steal a share of sales. The sector does not want to follow in the footsteps of PC makers, which have been relegated to becoming mere platforms on which software developers run their wares.\nCarmakers in Geneva said they did not rule out the possibility that new competitors could emerge, and acknowledged that some already had, like the electric carmaker Tesla. But they were skeptical that anyone would displace the established car brands anytime soon.\n\u201cWe always take competitors seriously,\u201d said Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of BMW.\n\u201cApple is a very strong brand,\u201d he said, but \u201cwe know how cars are built.\u201d\nWhether prodded by Apple and Google or not, BMW is hiring more software engineers to work on technologies like autonomous driving.\nBMW, which has come through the European downturn with its profitability intact, can afford such investment. But it is an added burden for the midrange carmakers like Ford of Europe and the General Motors subsidiary Opel, which are still struggling to make money on the Continent.\nWhile the overall market is growing again, and countries like Spain and Portugal are rebounding strongly, carmakers still have more production capacity in Europe than they need. And they have been hit by a severe slump in the Russian market caused by that country\u2019s poor economic performance, the plunge in the value of the ruble, and political tension with the West.\n\u201cI\u2019m not very optimistic in total about the European market,\u201d Karl-Thomas Neumann, the chief executive of Opel, said during a meeting with reporters.\nThe European car industry still has 20 percent more capacity than it needs, Mr. Neumann estimated. Underused factories are deadly for profits because they still must be maintained even if they are sometimes idle.\nJames D. Farley Jr., president of Ford\u2019s business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said, \u201c2015 will be a year of financial progress\u201d for the company. But he said Ford of Europe also faced headwinds, not only because of Russia but also because of low interest rates.\nWhile low rates reduce customers\u2019 financing costs, they raise the price of providing benefits to retired Ford workers, because it is harder for the pension fund to earn an adequate return.\nSome auto executives in Geneva found all the speculation about Apple\u2019s getting into the car business a bit too much.\n\u201cA car is so complex inside and out,\u201d said Gorden Wagener, vice president for design at Daimler, the maker of Mercedes cars. \u201cA smartphone is fairly simple compared to that.\u201d\nWhile visibly annoyed to be talking so much about Apple, Mr. Wagener acknowledged that the technology company exemplified the challenge that automakers will have to overcome as they integrate ever more digital technology into their vehicles.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the success of Apple? It\u2019s simplicity and user friendliness,\u201d Mr. Wagener said. \u201cThe one who will do it the best will succeed.\u201d"

        "title": "Pointing Fingers in Apple Pay Fraud",
        "fulltext": "When Apple was planning its Apple Pay electronic payment system last summer for its iPhones, the nation\u2019s banks raced to be included among the first credit card issuers associated with the new technology.\nApple\u2019s news release announcing Apple Pay had gushing quotes from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Brian Moynihan of Bank of America and Kenneth Chenault of American Express, along with a list of other companies as launch partners, including Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Capital One.\nMarianne Lake, JPMorgan\u2019s chief financial officer, said at the time of the introduction of Apple Pay, \u201cIt\u2019s the future, so it\u2019s great.\u201d\nSix months later, some of the nation\u2019s banks are privately complaining that Apple Pay may not be so great after all.\nBut the banks may largely have themselves to blame.\nA raft of headlines over the last week about unusually high fraud rates from thieves using stolen credit numbers on Apple Pay has exposed what many of the banks privately acknowledge they have been trying to fix for months.\nAn industry consultant, Cherian Abraham, put the fraud rate at 6 percent, compared with a traditional credit card fraud rate that is relatively minuscule, 10 cents for every $100 spent. Mr. Abrahamwrote in a blog post, one of the first to spotlight the issue, that the Apple Pay fraud \u201cis growing like a weed, and the bank is unable to tell friend from foe. No one is bold enough to call the emperor naked.\u201d\nIt is not clear, however, that Apple is the naked emperor. More likely it is at least as much the banks\u2019 fault, if not more.\nApple Pay itself should, in theory, cut down on fraud because it makes stealing credit card information almost impossible. Each time a transaction takes place, Apple generates the equivalent of a new credit card number so the merchant never actually sees a customer\u2019s information.\nThe vulnerability in Apple Pay is in the way that it \u2014 and card issuers \u2014 \u201conboard\u201d new credit cards into the system. Because Apple wanted its system to have the simplicity for which it has become famous and wanted to make the sign-up process \u201cfrictionless,\u201d the company required little beyond basic credit card information about a user. Nor did it provide much information to the banks, like full phone numbers and addresses, that might help them detect fraud early.\nThe banks, desperate to become their customers\u2019 default card on Apple Pay \u2014 most add only one to their iPhones \u2014 did little to build their own defenses or to push Apple to provide more detailed information about its customers. Some bank executives acknowledged that they were were so scared of Apple that they didn\u2019t speak up. The banks didn\u2019t press the company for fear that they would not be included among the initial issuers on Apple Pay. Within weeks of Apple Pay\u2019s introduction, a second set of banks joined: Barclays, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC Bank, USAA and U.S. Bank.\nIt also appears that banks set up a flawed process to deal with the credit cards that it did flag. Affected users were directed to a customer care phone center, not a fraud prevention center. A customer care center\u2019s mission is to help customers use their cards, leading more fraudulent cards to be approved for use on Apple Pay.\n\u201cCall centers are a poor approach for two reasons,\u201d Mr. Abraham wrote. \u201cOne \u2014 fraudsters are better at social engineering than call center reps are at sniffing out fraud. In some cases, fraudsters are calling the call center themselves to \u2018alert the bank about a trip out of town\u2019 so that fraud rules looking for transaction anomalies (like a customer living in California and transacting in Miami) do not trip them up.\u201d\nSome Apple supporters have sought to discredit Mr. Abraham based on his affiliation as an adviser to a company that is based on Apple\u2019s main competitor, Android. While he may indeed be conflicted, he has rightfully raised an important security issue that all sides have acknowledged is a problem, though perhaps not to the extent he has contended.\nAll of this has led to a thriving black market in which thieves enter stolen credit card numbers into iPhones, essentially turning the devices into physical credit cards, which they in turn take to stores and walk out with merchandise. Thieves have even used Apple Pay at Apple Stores.\nIn a statement, Apple put the problem squarely on the shoulders of the banks: \u201cDuring setup, Apple Pay requires banks to verify each and every card and the bank then determines and approves whether a card can be added to Apple Pay. Banks are always reviewing and improving their approval process, which varies by bank.\u201d\nApple has now begun providing additional information to the banks that should help deter some of the fraud. The banks, which are responsible for the costs of the frauds, have toughened standards to review customer sign-ups on Apple Pay. No bank executive would speak with me on the record for fear of upsetting their company\u2019s relationship with Apple. If you\u2019re asking yourself, \u201cWhy are criminals more inclined to use Apple Pay than just use stolen credit cards at an online retailer?\u201d it\u2019s a good question. It is apparently much easier for banks to catch thieves using stolen credit cards with online retailers because of the delay in shipping a product \u2014 it can often take days \u2014 as well as the extra information that every online retailer requires, like an address where the product is to be shipped.\nFirst-mover advantage is often crucial when it comes to the rapidly changing and rabidly competitive world of technology, but that can quickly turn to disadvantage when companies rush headlong into trouble."
