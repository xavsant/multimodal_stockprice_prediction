        "title": "Farhad and Mike\u2019s Week in Tech: Snoozing at CES",
        "fulltext": "Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, reviewthe week\u2019s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry.\nFarhad: Hello, Michael! It\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve chatted. I hope your holidays were fun. We took the kids to Disneyland just before Christmas. All was going swimmingly until it began to drizzle, and then to pour, and before we knew it Toontown was flooded and cast members rushed through to evacuate us \u201cbackstage\u201d to Fantasyland. It was a bummer, but also a perfect metaphor for 2016.\nMike: That sounds terrible! But on the bright side, at least your kids didn\u2019t see the face ofone of the cast members fall off.\nI spent my holiday sick in bed, which is basically what my body decides to do once it realizes I have some time off. Now I\u2019m healthy and ready to start working again. Woo!\nFarhad: O.K., let\u2019s talk tech. So, the big event was CES, the huge consumer electronics trade show that takes place in Las Vegas every year. But we\u2019ll get to that later. Let\u2019s start with Medium. Or should I say, Small?\nDo you get it?\nMike: I don\u2019t understand the question, and Iwon\u2019t respondto it.\nFarhad: Yeah, so Medium, the web\u2019s favorite place for tech bros to tell us how they really feel about homeless people, laid off a third of its staff this week. The reason wasn\u2019t that it was losing a bunch of money, according to the Medium post from its chief executive, Evan Williams. Instead, Williams says that the company wants to find some way tocompletely reimagine how to support digital content.\nMike:Yeah, him and the rest of the publishing industry.\nFarhad:At the moment, most online content is funded by advertising, and Medium had spent a lot of time creating new kinds of ad products. But Williams now says that creating slightly new ad stuff wasn\u2019t a big enough plan. So he\u2019s laying off 50 people and taking time to find some other business model. There\u2019s only one problem: He has no idea what it is, yet.\nMike:I feel like if you\u2019re giving up on ads, there\u2019s only two ways you can go with this. Tip jars and donations which, for new media start-ups that aren\u2019t grant funded, doesn\u2019t seem scalable. Or go the way of the subscription, which I believe in for some companies that have high value propositions (i.e. The New York Times) or longstanding brand equity (again, usually found in legacy institutions like The Times). Medium may have the former, but hardly has the latter. It\u2019s hard to get to scale when you\u2019re only a few years old, have a small staff and aren\u2019t filled with consistently high-quality content.\nFarhad: I think there was some schadenfreude among media people about his announcement, but I found myself agreeing with a lot of Williams\u2019 position. He\u2019s right: There\u2019s a lot of terrible content being created online only because the business model demands it \u2014 because you get clicks and reshares by publishing it. If a rich guy is looking to figure out some better way, I\u2019m all for it.\nMike:I actually agree with you here. I think the media\u2019s instinct is to be cynical, which is typically a good check to power for large institutions that deserve it.\nWhile I\u2019m hardly saying folks shouldn\u2019t criticize Medium, I do think our industry likes to kick folks when they\u2019re down for what is perceived as hubris, even if those companies were trying to build and improve upon what is clearly a model that won\u2019t sustain the number of media companies currently out there.\nThat said, Ev\u2019s \u201ceverything is terrible, but I don\u2019t have a solution, I\u2019ll just say it\u2019s all bad\u201d approach to that blog post turned a bunch of people off, including me. I guess we\u2019ll watch for the company\u2019s next act.\nFarhad: In other media news:Apple removed The New York Times\u2019s news apps from its App Store in China, in response to a request from the Chinese government. The Times\u2019s website has been banned in China since 2012, and now, according to Apple, the government contends that the apps are in violation of local regulations. But neither the government nor Apple will say what those regulations are.\nMike:Sounds about right. The timing of the removal is particularly interesting, givensome of the recent stories from our talented colleagues.\nFarhad:Sure, Apple has to comply with local laws, so its hands are likely tied. Also, obviously, you and I have a bias in this issue. But here\u2019s what I wonder: Why doesn\u2019t it raise a bigger outcry about this sort of censorship? When the F.B.I. asked Apple to unlock a terrorist\u2019s iPhone last year, Apple didn\u2019t just roll over and do it. It staked its entire corporate image on fighting the American government\u2019s request using every available tool, including the courts and the public relations.\nChina is a big market. Apple can\u2019t abandon it. But can\u2019t Tim Cook come out and say, \u201cThis is censorship, and we\u2019ll go kicking and screaming before we implement it?\u201d\nMike:Perhaps Apple just doesn\u2019t want to pick a fight in this censorship versus journalism arena, which is certainly the company\u2019s prerogative. It\u2019s all odd to me.\nFarhad: O.K., back to CES. I said earlier that it was the big event. I lied. It was supposed to be the big event, but in reality CES once again landed with a thud. As has been true for several years now, most of the largest tech companies shied away from CES, which suffers from that old Yogi Berra problem \u2014 no one goes there anymore, it\u2019s too crowded. (Sorry, I\u2019m 63.)\nMike:What are you talking about? Dell released an update to the XPS 13! Isn\u2019t that amazzzzzz\u2026\nFarhad:So instead we had a parade of announcements from tertiary players (ourcolleague Brian X. Chen has a rundown). If there was any theme to the announcements, it was voice: The future is going to be full of talking computers. Alexa, Amazon\u2019s voice assistant,was the centerpiece of several announcements. It will bein Ford cars, in a new speaker by Lenovo, in some home appliances, and evena dancing robot.\nMike, what gadget would you like to talk to? And do you have any other thoughts about CES that you\u2019d love to get off your chest? I haven\u2019t made fun of you once yet, so please, give me some fodder.\nMike: I\u2019m of the mind that nothing in my house should talk to me except humans and one day possibly my dog. Other than that, it\u2019ll make me paranoid someone has broken into my apartment and decided to tell mewhat the mass of the sun is in grams.\nOh, and I\u2019d prefer not to talk any more about CES lest it trigger my post-attendance PTSD.\nAdios!\nFarhad: See you next week. Now I\u2019m going to go have a heart-to-heart with Alexa."

        "title": "Daily Report: An Ex-Apple Employee Firm, Far From the Tree",
        "fulltext": "Can a company be successful like Apple, without being Apple to the core?\nI\u2019m sorry about that pun, too, but it gets to a key point inVindu Goel\u2019s articleabout Pearl Automation, a start-up with many former Apple employees. Management\u2019s aim is to duplicate the small teams and excellent design of Apple, among other things, without Apple\u2019s infamous culture of secrecy.\nPearl aims to make products that give older cars some of the features of new vehicles, like backup cameras. It\u2019s a good market to attack: According to a2015 report by IHS, the average age of cars and light trucks on roads in the United States is now 11.5 years. People keep new cars for six and a half years.\nCars are better built than they were in the past, so they wear longer, but that means drivers may miss out on lots of new safety features, particularly as more high-tech software and microcontrollers go inside the vehicles.\nThe Apple work structure, of small teams with lots of accountability for all engineering decisions, makes particular sense when you are selling safety. And, of course, Pearl is not yet considered wildly successful or an iconic designer, so for now at least it is easy to forgo Apple\u2019s secrecy.\nBased on reviews at a half-dozen websites, Pearl\u2019s first product, the backup camera, seems to have the reception of an Apple product, with high user ratings and a very high price. Pearl\u2019s camera rig is about $500, and there are lots of competitors selling cameras from $60 to $140.\nThat high price may be a big deal when people are looking at something to throw into their older car. There are also complaints about the software, and how well the solar charger works when it is cloudy. On the other hand, the camera can be removed from one vehicle and put on another, meaning the cost could be stretched beyond one vehicle.\nAnd software tends to improve, particularly if lower-level employees writing the code have a clear view of what everyone in the company is doing. That\u2019s possible at Pearl, but not at Apple."

        "title": "Coming From Automakers: Voice Control That Understands You Better",
        "fulltext": "EVERY once in a while, just for laughs, Kevin Smith-Fagan tries to call a friend of his, Priscilla, using the voice-recognition system in his 2013 Chevrolet Volt.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried it so many times and it never gets it right,\u201d said Mr. Smith-Fagan, an executive at a public television station in Sacramento. \u201cIt always thinks I\u2019m saying \u2018Chris,\u2019 and I have like five people named Chris in my phone book, so it\u2019s always interesting to see who\u2019s getting the call.\u201d\nVoice control systems have been in cars for more than a decade, and great strides have been made in the technology\u2019s ability to understand human speech. But many people still find these systems too unreliable, or annoying, to use for more than the most simple tasks, like \u201cCall Mom.\u201d\nThat isn\u2019t stopping auto and tech companies from trying to give drivers the ability to do even more things by talking to their cars \u2014 while keeping their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. The efforts have some added urgency now, as states pass stricter laws aimed at curbing distracted driving. Under a California law that went into effect Jan. 1, holding or operating a phone while driving is now prohibited.\nThis week at the International CES, the giant electronics conference in Las Vegas, Ford Motor announced that owners of its cars would soon be able to use Amazon\u2019s Alexa voice-activated assistant in their vehicles. Drivers will be able to ask for a weather report, stream music from Amazon Music or add appointments to their calendars. They will also be able to use Alexa from home to start or unlock their cars remotely.\nBut the automaker also envisions drivers using Alexa to help with other tasks \u2014 like shopping on Amazon. Stuck in traffic? You can take care of Valentine\u2019s Day by saying, \u201cAlexa, order flowers on Amazon.\u201d\nOther companies are moving in the same direction. Apple\u2019s Siri can be used to control iPhone functions in cars, and Apple\u2019s CarPlay software allows drivers to dictate text messages while driving, as well as program destinations into Apple Maps and have the route plotted on the car\u2019s display. Google\u2019s Android Auto can do the same.\nIn the last year, carmakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and General Motors have also introduced improved voice-recognition systems that can understand normal spoken words for many tasks. Older systems required drivers to learn specific commands.\nWith newer models, owners can program in a destination just by saying the address, as if speaking to another person. In older cars, the state, city and street had to be given separately, one at a time \u2014 and if you were lucky, each was correctly understood.\nWhile more advanced systems like Alexa will make it easier for drivers to use voice commands, there are still hurdles. The biggest is just changing habits, and persuading people to try talking to their cars.\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, Frank Krieber bought a 2016 Dodge Challenger, granite gray, with a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 engine, and the latest version of the Uconnect infotainment system. A few days later, when he set off on a road trip to Florida from his home in Michigan, he synced his phone to the car, but didn\u2019t bother to use the voice-recognition capabilities to enter destinations or handle other tasks.\n\u201cI probably should use it, but it\u2019s just easier to put in an address manually, so I haven\u2019t really played around with it,\u201d said Mr. Krieber, a sales executive for a computer company. \u201cMy experience so far has been, when you tell it to do something, it doesn\u2019t do what you want.\u201d\nOlder cars used voice-recognition systems that were built into the car and had limited computing power and memory. Now that more and more cars have wireless connections, the voice-recognition processing can be done via the internet in distant computers and servers, what the tech industry calls the cloud.\nThat is an advantage that Ford sees in using Alexa, said Don Butler, Ford\u2019s executive director for connected vehicle and services. \u201cIf you have the voice recognition done outside the car, people will see a much greater ability to interpret normal, everyday speech,\u201d he said.\nWith Alexa, a user will need to download an Alexa app to a phone and carry the phone in the car, creating the connection with the cloud.\nFord and Amazon have also developed a way to get Alexa to work seamlessly with a Ford car\u2019s own built-in entertainment and navigation systems. Alexa will first be available in a few months in battery-powered and hybrid models like the Focus Electric and Fusion Energi, and later in other Ford models.\n\u201cYou can ask Alexa where the nearest Starbucks is, and have her program the address into the Ford navigation system for you,\u201d Mr. Butler said.\nFor Amazon, the collaboration with Ford is another illustration of a broader push by technology giants to push their versions of voice assistants, which are made to perform simple tasks like turning on lights at home, playing music and fetching sports scores from the internet.\nApple was an early entrant into the market with its Siri assistant for iPhones. Google has its Assistant and a new connected speaker featuring the voice technology called Google Home. And Samsung, which has announced plans to buy the audio and automobile technology company Harman International Industries, last year agreed to acquire a voice assistant start-up, Viv Labs.\nMany analysts believe Amazon has vaulted to a leadership position in the race with the surprise success of the Echo family of smart speakers. While Amazon does not reveal sales figures for its devices, the company recently said that the Echo speaker and a smaller device called Echo Dot were the best-selling products on Amazon last year.\nAmazon has been more aggressive than other tech giants in getting other companies like Ford to integrate Alexa into their products. Dozens of other companies were expected to announce plans at CES to allow people to control their devices using Alexa.\nThe satellite television provider Dish Network said people who use its Hopper digital video recorders would be able to use Alexa voice commands to change channels and play movies. Lenovo, the computer maker, announced its own Alexa-based speaker, Lenovo Smart Assistant. The maker of Seiki, Westinghouse Electronics and Element Electronics televisions said it would build Alexa into the remote controls for some 4K sets from those brands.\nIn California, Mr. Smith-Fagan would welcome better voice recognition. \u201cWith the new law we have, I\u2019m kind of worried, because everyone\u2019s going to have to find a way to use the phone without touching it with your hands,\u201d he said."

        "title": "Apple Removes New York Times Apps From Its Store in China",
        "fulltext": "Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month.\nThe move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times\u2019s websites in 2012, aftera series of articleson the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app.\nApple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.\n\u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations,\u201d Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. \u201cAs a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d\nMr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented.\nChina\u2019s main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions.\nThe Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision.\n\u201cThe request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world,\u201d Ms. Murphy said in a statement.\nThe request appears to have been made underregulationsreleased in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services.\nThe regulations say apps cannot \u201cengage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others.\u201d The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish \u201cprohibited\u201d information.\nThe ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of \u201charmful information\u201d online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable.\nApple has previouslyremovedother, less prominentmediaappsfrom its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them.\nApple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it tohelp federal officials unlock an iPhonefor a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able tounlock the device without Apple's helpand the case was dropped.\ntranscript\n(SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) 28-YEAR-OLD FREELANCER AND NEW YORK TIMES READER, XIE YUJUAN, SAYING: \u201cI think the impact on me is okay. The possible impact is that I can\u2019t receive these news feeds in a timely manner and I have to proactively \u2018climb over the wall\u2019 to get the information. The means of getting information is no longer passive and has become active, but I can still get the information.\u201d (SOUNDBITE) (Mandarin) CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN, GENG SHUANG, SAYING: \u201cI am not clear on the details of this issue, but what I can tell you is that China always supports and encourages the development of the internet, and the development of the internet in China must respect China\u2019s laws and regulations, in principle.\u201d (SOUNDBITE) (English) HONG KONG LEGISLATIVE COUNCILLOR FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONAL CONSTITUENCY, CHARLES MOK, SAYING: \u201cBeing able to provide services to its own citizens, I think it (the Chinese government) will continue to probably exercise more censorship on international media that has been trying to or, whether they are on purpose trying to, get into China or just by being in the app store or even on the Google platform, Android platform, being available for people to download, probably China is looking at that as a loophole.\u201d\nFarzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents.\n\u201cMaybe in the end they have to do it, but I think there\u2019s something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there,\u201d Ms. Aslam said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as, \u2018Because we operate in your jurisdiction, we\u2019ll do anything you ask of us.\u2019\u201d\nShe added that it was \u201cvery worrying\u201d that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the government\u2019s requests.\nIn the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollarsin hidden perks and subsidiesthat the Chinese government provides to the world\u2019s biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apple\u2019s largest iPhone markets, thoughsales in that region have slowed.\nOn Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apple\u2019s media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.\nLater that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said.\nIn another article, published on Dec. 22 as apost on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an anti-Western internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices.\nThe Times news apps remain available in Apple\u2019s app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China.\nWhen the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content.\nBut readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the government\u2019s firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its Chinese-language app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop.\nApple\u2019s decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another region\u2019s app store.\nThe Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military hadtargeted the newspaper\u2019s computer systemsand that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation.\nForeign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April,Apple\u2019s iBooks Store and iTunes Movieswere shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there.\nMark Natkin, the Beijing-based managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could \u201cever fully comprehend how challenging it\u2019s going to be.\u201d\nMr. Natkin said that Apple had a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that \u201cthe technology gap has started to close.\u201d"

        "title": "Apple Adds to Qualcomm\u2019s Troubles, Filing Lawsuit Over Rebates",
        "fulltext": "SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry.\nSome days that is a real drag.\nOn Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things.\nApple sued three days after theFederal Trade Commission accused Qualcommof using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone.\nIn its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \u201cthe world\u2019s dominant supplier\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \u201celevated royalties\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too.\nThe commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems,including a $975 million fineby Chinese regulators in 2015and activist shareholder complaintslater that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing.\nWhen Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said.\nQualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F.T.C. suit. \u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too.\nFew expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable.\n\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\u2019s tough.\u201d\nQualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were well-regarded electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company.\nQualcomm\u2019s engineers work at a 41-building campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores.\nCompanies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like high-speed wireless video for millions of people at once.\nIts major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones.\nQualcomm\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of third-generation, or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls.\nAt the time, many thought Qualcomm\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23.6 billion and a profit of $5.7 billion.\nQualcomm\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless.\n\u201cYou\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\u201d said Clint McClellan, a 17-year employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \u201cWe enabled those markets.\u201d\nSouth Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\u2019s revenue. Apple\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center.\nQualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone \u2014 at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty.\nThat, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in andpressed for a breakup of the companyinto separate intellectual property and chip businesses.\nThat did not happen, butQualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems.\nBy helping to create today\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks.\n\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests.\u201d\nIn an email, Hea-Ryoung Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators.\nQualcomm\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\u2019s president and abribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\u2019s regulatory issues there.\nAdditionally, the F.T.C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10.\nNeither the F.T.C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm.\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\u2019ve contributed to their success,\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\u2019s president.\nNow it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not sitting still\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives.\u201d\nIn other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\u2019s expensive intellectual property."

        "fulltext": "If you are reading this in China, congratulations. Not many people are.\nThat is because Chinese authorities instructed Apple late last month to remove The New York Times news app from the Apple app store. As Katie Benner and Sui-Lee Weereport, the move follows China\u2019s 2012 blocking of The Times\u2019s website. In 2012, the shutdown appeared to be the result of a series of reports in The Times on the extensive wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then China\u2019s prime minister.\nIt is not clear why the app was removed. Apple would not even say what regulatory violation, if any, caused the removal; who in the Chinese government told Apple to do it; or whether any legal case had been made, or legal documents presented, before Apple acceded to China\u2019s wishes.\nThe removal happened on Dec. 23. Earlier that day, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with Apple executives in conjunction with anarticlethat would be published on Dec. 29 on the billions of dollars in perks and subsidies that China provides to the world\u2019s largest iPhone manufacturer, Foxconn, a manufacturing partner of Apple\u2019s.\nThe move underlines the difficulty news organizations face in reporting on China, particularly when the country\u2019s own people are also the readers.\nApple, which values China as both a manufacturing center and a consumer market, has in the past removed other news apps. Those of other major publishers remain available on the app store in China.\nIt is unclear whether Apple has ever resisted a Chinese order to remove an app, or otherwise broken with a request from the government.\nLast year, Apple had an extendeddisputewith the United States government about helping to unlock an iPhone of a terrorist who had committed murders. Timothy D. Cook, Apple\u2019s chief executive, said the company would comply with any court order, but this became unnecessary when the United Statesemployedhackers to open the iPhone."

        "title": "Clearing Out the App Stores: Government Censorship Made Easier",
        "fulltext": "There\u2019s a new form of digital censorship sweeping the globe, and it could be the start of something devastating.\nIn the last few weeks, the Chinese government compelled Apple toremove New York Times appsfrom the Chinese version of the App Store. Then the Russian government hadApple and Google pull the app for LinkedIn, the professional social network, after the network declined to relocate its data on Russian citizens to servers in that country. Finally, last week, a Chinese regulator asked app stores operating in the countryto register with the government, an apparent precursor to wider restrictions on app marketplaces.\nThese moves may sound incremental, and perhaps not immediately alarming. China has been restricting the web forever, and Russia is no bastion of free speech. So what\u2019s so dangerous about blocking apps?\nHere\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s a more effective form of censorship.\nBlocking a website is like trying to stop lots of trucks from delivering a banned book; it requires an infrastructure of technical tools (things likeChina\u2019s \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d), and enterprising users can often find a way around it. Banning an app from an app store, by contrast, is like shutting down the printing press before the book is ever published. If the app isn\u2019t in a country\u2019s app store, it effectively doesn\u2019t exist. The censorship is nearly total and inescapable.\nBut that\u2019s not the end of this story. The banning of apps highlights a deeper flaw in our modern communications architecture: It\u2019s the centralization of information, stupid.\n\u201cI think the app store censorship issue is one layer of ice on the surface of the iceberg above the waterline,\u201d said Eben Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and a leader in the free software movement of activists who have long been warning about the dangers of centrally managed, commercial software.\nFor more than a decade, we users of digital devices have actively championed an online infrastructure that now looks uniquely vulnerable to the sanctions of despots and others who seek to control information. We flocked to smartphones, app stores, social networks and cloud storage. Publishers like The New York Times are investing in apps and content posted to social networks instead of the comparatively open World Wide Web. Some start-ups now rely exclusively on apps; Snapchat, for instance, exists only as a mobile app.\nCompared with older forms of distributing software, apps downloaded from app stores are more convenient for users and often more secure from malware, and they can be more lucrative for creators. But like so much else online now, they risk feeding into mechanisms of central control. In most countries, the Apple and Google app stores are the only places to find apps for devices running their respective operating systems. (There are more choices for Android app stores in China, where Google does not offer its store.)\nThe internet\u2019s earliest boosters considered it a magical tool to liberate people from restrictions on speech. The easy banning of apps suggests that if we let it, the internet could instead become something quite the opposite \u2014 one of the most efficient choke points of communication the world has ever seen.\nThis was not how it was supposed to be. Decentralized communications was once a central promise of the internet. In the 1960s and 1970s, with the world on the brink of nuclear Armageddon, a cadre of academic and military engineers set out to create a communications system thatcontained no single point of failure or control. The network they came up with, which evolved into the modern internet, connected every machine to every other through many different paths. That way, if any portion of the network were wiped out by an attack, traffic would simply route itself to a new path.\nAs the threat of nuclear attack diminished and the internet grew, its decentralized design became as much a political selling point as a technical one.\n\u201cOurs is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere,\u201d the activist John Perry Barlow argued in his 1996 manifesto, \u201cA Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.\u201d He predicted that because of the internet\u2019s everywhere-ness, the world\u2019s governments would never be able to lasso the digital realm. The computer scientist and activist John Gilmoretold Time magazine in 1993, \u201cThe Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.\u201d\nWhat the creators and early proselytizers of the internet did not foresee was the rapid commercialization of the network. The internet that Mr. Barlow and Mr. Gilmore envisioned was built and maintained by collectives of users; the one that users flocked to was tamed by companies whose very success turned them into some of the largest corporations on the planet.\nThe internet is now no longer \u201ceverywhere and nowhere.\u201d Just about all of its economic value is instead connected to two very specific somewheres: the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, the homes of Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook, the four monstrously large companies that own the internet\u2019s central information platforms. As these companies began to build ever-larger empires online, they have evolved into convenient choke points \u2014 the very points of control that the internet was designed to eliminate.\nLike all companies, online companies must offer some level of deference to governments. They obey local and national laws, court orders and national security authorities, and bend to other, less transparent means of coercion. They can fight governments \u2014 as Apple did when itbattled the F.B.I.over unlocking a terrorist\u2019s iPhone last year \u2014 but they often must pick their battles and balance their interests. Apple makes a significant fraction of its profits from China. Can it really risk all those billions to protect a handful of apps?\nApple offered this statement in response to my queries on how it decides to take down apps: \u201cFor some time now the New York Times app has not been permitted to display content to most users in China, and we have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.\u201d Google declined to comment.\nBut Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights activist organization, said the internet giants were not without leverage in this fight.\n\u201cThe flip side of that is, is China going to block the entire Apple App Store over a single app?\u201d she asked. Interestingly, the internet giants\u2019 hold on every aspect of online life works toward their advantage in battling governments.\n\u201cThe bigger a company is, the bigger the risk that blocking them will lead to riots in the streets because you have come between people and their pictures of cats,\u201d Ms. Galperin said. \u201cThose are the companies that governments are going to be more wary of blocking, and they should be the ones that stand up to government pressure. They have a special responsibility.\u201d\nUsers and app developers who are now at risk of being censored also bear some responsibility. When I asked Mr. Moglen at Columbia about app bans, he was incensed that I didn\u2019t recognize The New York Times\u2019s own complicity in this story.\nThe Times, he argued, could have stuck with the old way of publishing news. The company could have declined to create a downloadable app and instead invested all of its engineering resources into making its news available on the web, anonymously. The Times could have refused to profile users for advertising purposes, or to have its articles hosted on Facebook, or to monitor what people read in order to recommend more articles to keep people engaged. In short, The Times could have refused to play the modern digital-publishing game. But like every other publisher, it went along.\n\u201cWhat did you expect would happen?\u201d Mr. Moglen asked. \u201cChina didn\u2019t have to build a Great Firewall to do this. You all offered them an opportunity to piggyback onto your disrespect for the privacy and integrity and autonomy of your readers and users.\u201d\nI don\u2019t agree with Mr. Moglen that The Times disrespects its readers by offering a news app. (I think it\u2019s a very nice app.) But he is right that a lot of people online walked blindly into the no-win position we are in now, where our only recourse against censorship might be the good will of a few giant corporations that control most of the internet.\nThere has to be some other way. Let\u2019s maybe work on finding it."

        "fulltext": "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s coming up this week.\nTECHNOLOGY\nStrong sales of the iPhone 7 mean that Apple probably returned to growth in the quarter that ended in Decemberafter revenue declinesin the previous three quarters. Apple\u2019s results, which will be reported on Tuesday after the market closes, will include three full months of sales of the company\u2019s latest smartphone models, including the supersize iPhone 7 Plus, which wasintroduced in September. Analysts say that Apple benefited from Samsung\u2019s global recall of the Galaxy Note 7 afterbattery problemscaused the devices to catch fire. Wall Street will look for clues about the 10th-anniversary iPhones, due out this fall, as well as the performance of Apple\u2019s fast-growing service businesses.Vindu Goel\nECONOMY\nThe Federal Reserve probably doesn\u2019t mind that nobody has been paying much attention to monetary policy lately. The Fed\u2019s chairwoman, Janet Yellen,joked recentlythat she hoped stories about the central bank would move from the front page to the 19th page of the newspaper. But the Fed will make a brief return to center stage on Tuesday and Wednesday, when officials gather in Washington for the first policy-making meeting of the year. The central bank haspredicted three rate increasesin 2017, but the first is unlikely to come in January. Fed officials, just like everyone else, are waiting to see what effect the Trump administration will have on the economic outlook.Binyamin Appelbaum\nThis week, the private Institute for Supply Management will report the latest readings of its manufacturing index for January. On Wednesday at 10 a.m., the manufacturing index for January will be announced. Analysts expect a further increase to 55.0 percent from54.5 percent in December, when it hit a two-year high. Regional manufacturing surveys have been healthy, and the factory sector appears stable. (A reading above 50 indicates expansion.)Patricia Cohen\nTECHNOLOGY\nFacebook will report its fourth-quarter fiscal results on Wednesday. Analysts expect the company to deliver another blockbuster quarter of advertising revenue. Wall Street anticipates an earnings per share ratio of $1.31 on total revenue of $8.5 billion. As always, investors will pay close attention to Facebook\u2019s mobile user numbers and the percentage of revenue derived from mobile devices. Also of note: the advertising performance of the photo-sharing network Instagram.Mike Isaac\nECONOMY\nOn Wednesday, the Indian government is scheduled to unveil Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s budget for the next fiscal year, which will start on April 1. Mr. Modi\u2019s decision toban larger-denomination rupee billsfrom circulation has slowed the economy, and the question now is how much the government can afford to cut taxes and reduce revenue to rekindle economic growth. Much of the gain from canceling larger-denomination bills accrues not to the government and its budget but rather to India\u2019s central bank.Keith Bradsher\nThe Bank of England on Thursday will release its latest monetary policy decision and unveil its updated forecast for inflation The announcement will be followed by a news conference by Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor. The Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep interest rates steady, as the British economy has performed better than expected since Britain\u2019s June vote to leave the European Union, known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d\nThe Office of National Statistics said last week that Britain\u2019s economy had grown at an estimated0.6 percent ratefrom October to December. That was ahead of forecasts by economists. In August, the central bankcut its benchmark interest rateto 0.25 percent, the lowest level in its 322-year history, and expanded other measures to bolster Britain\u2019s economy over fears that Brexit could weigh on growth. The rate had remained 0.5 percent since March 2009.Chad Bray\nBANKING INDUSTRY\nDeutsche Bank will be the latest of Europe\u2019s biggest lenders to report its annual results. The bank, Germany\u2019s largest, will update investors on its performance in the fourth quarter on Thursday, followed by a news conference by John Cryan, its chief executive. Deutsche Bank said this month that it would\u201csubstantially limit\u201d bonusesfor the 2016 financial year after it agreed in December to pay$7.2 billion to resolve an investigationby the American authorities into its sale of toxic mortgage securities.Chad Bray\nECONOMY\nOn Friday at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will report on job creation and the unemployment rate in January. The announcement is the first jobs report of the Trump presidency, and economists are eager to see if risingconsumerandbusinessconfidence reported after the election has translated into job creation.\nThe median forecast calls for a gain of 170,000 jobs for the month, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.7 percent. In addition to looking at the overall numbers, experts will watch whether the trend ofhealthier increases in average hourly wageslate last year continued in January.Nelson D. Schwartz"
